"Although this is generally a cheesy jungle-adventure movie	 it does have some highlights - the settings are quite beautiful	 and the pacing of the adventure is good. You won't be bored watching it.<br /><br />Keith is as breezy as possible playing the eponymous lead	 an unabashedly drunk jungle guide shanghai'd into escorting rich boy Van Hoffman and his gorgeous wife Shower on a hunting expedition in cannibal country. He never takes things seriously . Shower is there as decoration and Keith makes extensive use of her - she doesn't really have to act much. She's not the only female to show off her body and the prurient aspects of the film make it about halfway to a T/A picture.<br /><br />There's nothing in this film that would draw specific attention to it	 or away from it. Produced to be shlock	 it succeeds without too much fuss. A good 2 AM cable programmer."	0.0
"If you want a serious laugh pain	 watch this movie	 and the things Bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster. The deleted scenes are priceless. I don't know why they didn't include them in the original movie. It can't be because of time	 since the movie is only 101 minutes long. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor	 who has been overlooked for too long. Jim Carrey needs meds!"	1.0
"Spectacular Horror movie that will give you the chills once you get settled with it. The atmosphere is very creepy and stylish	 the score is chilling	 but the best about the movie is it's performances. It's rare to get scared by performances and this movie's solid acting plays an important part in the scare factor.<br /><br />The story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes. Though the woman in black does not have much screen time	 she makes the necessary appearances to chill the audience in some brilliant scenes. The dialogs are very descriptive and make your imagination work and that's when it becomes really scary. <br /><br />If you have the chance	 watch this on theater it's a totally different experience but as scary as this movie.<br /><br />This is one of the best Ghost movies ever and it's directed for people that want to get scared."	1.0
"<br /><br />Everything is relative seems to be the main theme from the outset by this set of eleven pieces by eleven directors. That is to say that what might be number one priority for people like Bush	 Blair and Company	 may not be so for a great many other people	 ordinary people. From the opening scene in which an Iranian teacher is trying to impress on her little students the most important thing that has happened	 with the result the children are not impressed	 as the death of a neighbour and things like that evidently affect them much more closely than anything which may have happened in New York	 USA	 wherever that is	 this series of almost documentary styled pieces establishes that not all things are as equal unto all men as some world leaders would try to prophess. <br /><br />Whereas	 obviously	 the attack on the WTC was a dastardly event by any yardstick	 one does get the impression that both politicians and TV cameramen tend to blow up things out of all proportion - wonderfully manifested in one of these pieces. Would the same reaction at international level have occurred if the attack had been made on Lagos	 say	 or Djakarta	 say	 or even on Rio de Janeiro	 say? I rather think not. News seems to suffer distortion depending on where things happen: much more TV time is given to an earthquake in Italy	 say	 than one ten times more destructive in Outer Mongolia	 say. Greater distances seem to decrease the magnitude of the disaster. <br /><br />This series of eleven pieces helps to put things in better perspective - or	 perhaps I should say	 some of the pieces do	 as each director with complete freedom has made up his own story	 his own translated perspective	 such that it is not possible to judge the whole merits	 but individually for each eleven-minute segment. <br /><br />In no way should one deduce that this is an anti-American film: that would be a too simple reading of the diverse messages manifested through the segments. However	 it is not pro-American either. The eleven segments adopt varied attitudes and the common link - if there is one - is that the disaster of the WTC attack has to be seen in perspective from different view-points. Only then will such people as George Bush even begin to comprehend the planet he is living on. <br /><br />Clearly stated in one segment is a belief of mine I have been harbouring for two years now: America has not learnt the lesson. And the lesson is that the USA has to share this planet with the rest of humanity - not dominate it by ruthless economical persuasion or just plain force. Instead of learning that the USA cannot continue just stamping all over everybody and everywhere	 its political leaders	 aided and abetted by Blair (and even Aznar) have become even more arrogant and even more intolerant	 which is not doing any good to anyone in Afghanistan or Irak at present	 let alone much elsewhere. The White House mentality is totally rejectable: the US and UK invaded Irak and caused all the chaos	 and so should clear up the mess they caused - not insist on the UN and other nations to delve in with a helping hand and thus find an easy way out of the turmoil. <br /><br />Radical stances adopted by the US (or even Israel) is only going to be met by radical stances from Islamic people	 who for years have been gearing up fanatical fundamentalism	 if only to cover up their own macho uselessness	 i.e.	 stoning women to death or simply shrouding them from the tops of their heads to the dusty ground. <br /><br />The world is in a terrible mess	 fueled by the greed of a few rich countries who seem bent on not seeing or understanding anything from more multilateral perspectives. This film in eleven separate pieces accurately portrays this dismal and dumb posture."	1.0
"What did the director think? Everybody who has read the biography of Artemisia is left impressed by her guts to face a public rape trial in Renaissance times and even suffer torture in order to show that Tassi was guilty. That fact shows the real independence and emancipation - in her most terrible hour she stands her MAN. Why do movies depicting Renaissance have to be so clinically beautiful and romantic	 are we afraid to see the gritty side of life or has the Hollywood happy-happy-mood won? While I would always defend a director's freedom to create his own reality in a movie I cannot make sense of turning Artimisia's life story on its head. Very disappointing choice by the makers of this film."	0.0
"Otto Preminger's Dana Andrews cycle of films noirs are among the (largely) unsung jewels of the genre. Because they lack paranoia	 misogyny or hysteria	 they may have seemed out of place at the time	 but the clear-eyed imagery	 the complex play with identity	 masculinity and representation	 the subversion of traditional psychological tenets	 the austere	 geometrical style all seem startlingly modern today	 and very similar to Melville. The lucid ironies of this film are so loaded	 brutal and ironic that the 'happy' ending is one of the cruellest in Hollywood history. Brilliant on the level of entertaining thriller as well	 tense	 and packed with double-edged dialogue."	1.0
"i am very disappointed with this movie because i like these french actors and i liked ""Buffet Froid"" from this Director (bertrand blier) but the script of ""Les Acteurs"" is VERY POOR. why these actors they agreed to play this poor scenario."	0.0
Very good except for the ending which was a huge disappointment.<br /><br />The script was very good as was the acting. The visuals were often very grainy but this in a way added to the film as the snowy features were in good places that helped create a mood towards the film. This affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending. <br /><br />I was going to give this film an 8 out of ten but the ending knocked it down a point to 7 because it seemed to depart radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced at the end to make the film makers look clever. <br /><br />This movie though was much better than films with quite a lot larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment. Not much in the way of special effects as these go but for suspense it was very good.	1.0
"An uninspired and undistinguished ""new"" Columbo which sees the man-in-the-mac attend his nephew's wedding	 only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night. Columbo investigates...<br /><br />And that it is about it: indifferently plotted and surprisingly laden with a flat script	 given that it is written by Robert Van Scoyk	 who penned the highly enjoyable Columbo story ""Murder Under Glass"" in the detective's heyday; there is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of ingenuity afforded to Columbo by the script-writer is the narrowing down of suspects via the photos taken at the wedding	 which include everybody who was there!<br /><br />Devoid of every Columbo trait possible	 I thought I was watching an episode of Hill Street Blues. An insult to the history of the series	 with appropriately soap-opera style acting. Very avoidable stuff."	0.0
"Genghis Cohn is a (very) mildly entertaining British movie about a German police commissioner in the late 1950's who is haunted by the ghost of a Jewish comedian that he killed 15 years earlier while serving under Hitler in the SS. The ghost comes back and wants his killer to live as a Jew to atone for the murders he committed.<br /><br />Otto	 the German policeman actually knows this ghost's name because	 the last thing he did before he died was said	 in Yiddish	 `Kiss my ass'. The policeman didn't speak Yiddish	 so he asked around until he found the meaning. The `kiss my ass' left such an impression that everybody involved with that killing learned and remembered the comedian's name	 Genghis Cohn.<br /><br />There are a bunch of men who are murdered in the jurisdiction of the police commissioner	 and there are no helpful clues. The men are murdered with a set of knives that are missing from the local butcher. The butcher announces that his knives are missing while the commissioner is in the store to get a liver and onion sandwich	 so the commissioner is a suspect. The first man is killed while making love to the butcher's wife	 so the butcher is a suspect. But the butcher maintains that he would be very busy if he killed every man that slept with his wife. All the men are killed immediately after the climax of lovemaking.<br /><br />I think I might be a bit angrier than the ghost of Genghis Cohn if I was killed like he was. He seems to be very good-natured about it	 as if he was just in a mild car accident. I can only guess that it is because it is a British movie and they are known for being a very polite people. He uses some of his material from his stand-up routing	 and I just didn't find it very funny.<br /><br />I gave this movie a 4 because it was just kind of goofy. I thought it should have been a little more serious than it was. The movie turns out to be a murder mystery (where did this come from?)	 and it seemed that Genghis should have been more helpful than he was. The movie gave me a tiny look into Jewish culture	 but was only skin-deep. Do all Jews love liver and onion sandwiches? Do they all say `shtoop' and `meshuganah' in their daily vocabulary? Isn't there more important stuff that we should know about the culture?<br /><br />I saw this movie at a Jewish community center in Berkeley	 CA	 and I was the only person in the room whose hair was not fully gray or white. (I have no gray or white hair.) There were 18 of us	 and after the movie they stayed for about 20 minutes to discuss the movie. There were 2 main concerns expressed there: 1. The movie was way too light-hearted and future generations might not understand the gravity of what happened and 2. As the Holocaust survivors are dying off	 future generations will not know what really happened. I thought that this second concern was ridiculous and I told them I thought they didn't need to worry because there is tons of literature out there and there will always be people who like to watch movies	 like myself. The murder of 6	000	000 people by a very bad man will not ever be forgotten. I write this last paragraph because they charged me with telling others about my experience that day."	0.0
"Things get dull early an often in this in this mawkish jazz bio fiction written and directed by Spike Lee.<br /><br />Bleek Gilliam (Denzell Washington) is a happenin' jazz trumpeter that fronts a quintet packing them in at Below the Underdog. His problems include an incompetent manager	 a stage hogging sax player and two girlfriends that he's playing musical mattress with. The real love of his life though is his trumpet and his music. The band's manager	 Giant	 has a dangerous gambling problem and proves to be an ineffective negotiator with greedy club owners and would be best jettisoned but Bleek remains loyal for as long as possible. It will prove to his undoing as an artist but ironically contribute to his growth as a man.<br /><br />As Bleek	 Denzell Washington is all wrong as the ambitious trumpeter with a babe on each arm. He's too sweet a guy to be so self centered about his art	 dispensing patience and love to those close to him with a low key remoteness. He simply lacks the fire. Wesley Snipes who plays Henderson the sax player would have been far more suited for the role but even he would have to mouth the flaccid throw away scribblings of Lee's torpid dialogue. As Giant	 Lee hits the trifecta with an abysmal performance to match his writing and direction. Loosely attempting to mirror the grubby but sympathetic Ratso Rizzo to Bleek's Joe Buck he adopts a limp and even the ""I'm walkin' here"" moment from Midnight Cowboy. In this case you wish the taxi would run him over and be done with it.<br /><br />Lee's script is all tepid argument	 heavy handed ribbing and veiled insult with some requisite clumsy editorializing that Lee has to inject to remain down. The scenes between the band members backstage and in rehearsal lack spark and are only surpassed in dreariness by the Bleek	 Giant conversations that have an ad lib look and go in circles. Completing this travesty is Lee's pretentious visual style. Tracking shots	 zooms and pans are wasted and without significance to scenes. They just wander.<br /><br />Blues is Lee's love letter to jazz (made implicit by the mountains of memorabilia plastered all over the sets) and it's all sentimental clap trap that lacks passion and verve. Jazz on film is better served by Tavernier's ""Round Midnight"" and Eastwood's ""Bird"" which get below the surface	 reveal more sides of the form	 the pain behind it in addition to offering infinitely superior lead performances by Forrest Whitaker and the real deal Dexter Gordon. This Spike Lee Joint doesn't even offer a mild buzz. It's some pretty bad homegrown."	0.0
"Geez	 another Lifetime movie	 but once again isn't exactly the worst movie in the world	 but far from the best. I think the main problem is that it's pretty obvious who is responsible for what	 and it's generally fairly predictable. Worse yet	 some of the flashbacks ended up being confusing	 and the viewer is left wondering ""Okay	 how much am I supposed to care?"" One thing I did like is that the movie goes to show you that it's never THAT simple as ""the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad""	 and sometimes it IS evil vs evil rather than good vs evil. Hadley didn't do what she did out of a sense of justice	 she did it because she considered herself entitled to a job for being family	 AND to eliminate the competition. As for Alicia	 it simply proves that a victim isn't always a good person. Some of them really do ""have it coming""	 even if ""it"" was a painful	 horrible death. ""The Burning Bed"" is a great example of this	 but the difference is that the vile man in ""The Burning Bed"" got exactly what he deserved. But	 did Alicia ""have it coming""? Some will say that she did	 but others don't agree	 and the law generally doesn't either.<br /><br />As for acting	 it's a mixed bag. Some do a good job	 like Mia	 but others just came across as indifferent to their roles. They were mostly wooden or simply not convincing. The music was pretty cool though and some of the scenes are nice and steamy	 especially if you like girl/girl action. The movie isn't badly shot at all	 but given its glaring weaknesses	 the strengths are in background	 unfortunately.<br /><br />I've heard rumors of a sequel	 but given the years	 I doubt it'll happen. But	 I wouldn't be surprised if a sequel suddenly appeared. If Alicia is as EVIL	 conniving and horrible as people say	 then I don't think she'll be thinking	 ""YAY! I woke up from a coma! Oh	 Hadley was responsible? Oh! That's okay! I totally forgive her and want the charges dropped!"" No way Hadley would be in jail for long anyway	 if she even does any time since no murder actually happened. <br /><br />Anyway	 worth checking out at least once!"	0.0

The quest begins to reunite Paulie with Marie	 only more than 20 years has passed.<br /><br />The movie ends	 some will say predictably	 with Mikail reuniting Paulie with Marie. The story closes with the three entering Marie's home	 where you can make the final your own choice.<br /><br />Great family film!"	1.0
"Intrigued by the synopsis (every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover; this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign) I purchased BEN AND ARTHUR without knowing a thing about it. This is my second (and I assure you it will be my last) purchase of a CULTURE Q CONNECTION video. As far as I am concerned	 this DVD is nothing but a blatant rip-off. I do not make this observation lightly  I am a major collector of videos	 gay and mainstream	 and I can state with some authority and without hesitation that BEN AND ARTHUR is quite simply the worst film I have ever sat through in my life. Period. My collection boasts over 1	600 films (93% on them on DVD) and of those	 well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed. I hardly own every gay movie ever made	 but I am comfortable in stating that I pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released	 and very often I buy videos without knowing anything about the film. Sometimes	 this makes for a pleasant surprise - Aimee & Jaguar	 It's In The Water	 Urbania and Normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that I stumbled upon accidentally. So when I read on the box that BEN AND ARTHUR concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the Christian Right	 one of my favorite subjects	 I decided to take the plunge sight unseen	 despite my previously disappointing purchase of another CULTURE Q CONNECTION title	 VISIONS OF SUGAR PLUMS. That film was pretty bad	 but compared to BEN AND ARTHUR	 it viewed like GONE WITH THE WIND. So what was so wrong with BEN AND ARTHUR? Plenty! To begin with	 the ""plot"" such as it was	 was totally ridiculous. This film almost made me sympathetic to the Christian Right  we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay	 but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls (like this even makes sense). The writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all	 and several plot points reflect no logic	 follow-up or connection to the story. Murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist / right wing conflict on both sides	 and the acting is so bad that it's difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired. The characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay - and nelly stereotypes to boot; the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting. This film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever	 and the distributors should be ashamed of themselves. The only advantage this picture has over my other CULTURE Q Connection purchase	 VISIONS OF SUGARPLAMS	 is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue. Hardly a distinction	 since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is. It is an embarrassment to Queer culture	 and I intend to warn everyone I possibly can before they waste their money on it. At $9.95 this film would have been way overpriced; I understand that it's soon to be re-priced under $20	 which is STILL highway robbery. I paid the original price of $29.95	 and I never felt more cheated in my life. The only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews  I have seen ""user reviews"" for this film on numerous websites	 and there is always one or two that ""praise"" the director / writer / actor in such a way that it's obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this Ed Wood wannabe. How sad. How desperate. I just wish IMDb would allow you to assign zero stars - or even minus zero. If ever a film deserved it	 this is it."	0.0
"this movie just goes to show that you dont need big explosions	muti-billion dollar computer graphics	or highly over paid actors and actresses to make a good movie	 All you need is a excellent story line and plot. which the master of all japanese films	Akira Kurosawa pulls off brilliantly.

"I've been a fan since his first album. This film is a disservice to him. The performances	 except for one by Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson are simply terrible. <br /><br />Those by Martha Wainwright	 Nick Cave	 Antony	 and Jarvis Cocker were particularly annoying. Even the one by the McGarrigle sisters was ruined by the so called harmony of Martha Wainwright.<br /><br />I've never seen my wife get up and walk out of the room on a film before and I found myself fast forwarding through the performances to get to the few interview segments	 which were also difficult to watch due to the poor camera work. <br /><br />There are many who have been able to interpret Mr. Cohen's songs	 Jennifer Warnes	 KD Lang	 Billy Joel	 Aaron Neville	 and Willie Nelson come to mind	 but those people selected for this performance were just awful.<br /><br />Hopefully there will be another attempt at capturing Leonard Cohen on film that will illustrate his insight	 talent	 and intelligence.<br /><br />So sad"	0.0
"I first saw ""Breaking Glass"" when it was released in England in 1980..I loved it then and having just caught it in August 2005 on a Canadian station it still is great. The only thing I regret is I can't find the sound track or the DVD in the stores??...anyone care to shed some light or must I order it from some over priced internet company. But getting back to the film the music stands up to the test of time	 Hazel/Kate had something to say about 80's Britain..actually it was the same decade I moved to Canada for some of the same reasons one being ""Thatcher"" and what she was doing to the country at the time. Please if you get the chance watch this movie you won't be sorry!"	1.0
"They filmed this movie out on long Island	 where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. Apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer	 (which they told me was colored water	 tasted disgusting	 and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again	 especially in the funnel scenes). Yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form. It never came out in the theaters (obviously) and it	 as far as I knew	 was never released on video	 and I'm sure wasn't released on DVD. Yet it looks like it was seen by some people	 albeit it probably very few. So there must be something. I would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother	 yet there is no way I can find it anywhere. Does anybody know anything about when/where/how this movie could be purchased?

"James Gandolfini is a good actor so what ever did he take a role in this piece of unfunny rubbish. Affleck is just a lightweight who just can't cut it	 the rest of the cast are truly unforgettable.

I walked out before the end it was so bad	 so imagine my surprise when back in England I saw the movie had a glowing report from that yoyo ""Paul Ross"" in one of the down market Sundays. I always rely on Ross to save me money on cinema tickets	 if he says the movie is good	 I get straight on this very website to check it out. This movie should have gone straight to £1.99 DVD in a supermarket near you."	0.0
"First off there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel	 Revelation	 Matthew 24	 Isaiah and other prophetic scriptures. There is also nothing wrong with making a film such as this to attempt to present the gospel message. So my qualms with this movie are not in either its sincerity or aspirations. As a Christian	 though an amillenialist	 I believe there will be a great tribulation and I believe Christ will return as he said as much. So even though I have disagreement with this film about the rapture that is not why I rate this movie so low.<br /><br />No	 what makes me rate this movie so low is not its sincerity or its message	 but rather its lack of production values	 awful script	 mediocre acting	 and pitiful FX. This movie ranks down there with some of the cheesiest scifi fodder of the 1950s. No	 this movie ranks down there with Plan 9 From Outerspace. This movie failed to age well and was probably dated by the time they made a sequel.<br /><br />The apocalypse genre film producers could have learned how not to make an end times film from this	 but they failed. The Left Behind Series	 The Apocalypse series	 and the Omega Code series all failed to learn from this because they addressed the FX problems and the dated look problem	 but their scripts are still poor	 and their acting is wooden.<br /><br />There are great Christian films	 with extremely low budgets	 but this film is not one of them.

"This movie is a vehicle for Schwarzenegger-clone Alexander Nevsky. His charisma however is insufficient to lift this movie above the level of its poor script.

"Whoever said that horror wasn't an educational film genre	 huh? Thanks to this marvelous Hammer short movie	 I now at least know NEVER to offer a strange visitor any wine and a slice of bread with salt in my own house	 because he might just be hypnotist and this combination will give him the power to control my thoughts & mind forever! Thank you Hammer! The tenth episode in the House of Horror series is another one I've been looking forward to seeing	 mainly because the guy in the director's chair was Don Sharp; one of Britain's finest filmmakers but still sadly underrated. Sharp was responsible for some very cool Hammer films	 like ""Kiss of the Vampire"" and ""Rasputin: The Mad Monk""	 as well as some overlooked independent productions like ""Dark Places"" and ""Psychomania"". His contribution to House of Horror is easily one of the best in the series	 with a complex yet fascinating plot outline and revolving on delightful occult themes. The plot centers on two antique dealers that stumble upon a strange object resembling a mirror	 but it's actually an ancient scrying device that can be used to summon Choronzhon; the demonic guardian of the abyss. The mirror is heavily desired by a satanic cult since they need it for their ceremonies	 but Michael is reluctant to sell it before knowing the real value of the device. When he picks up a clearly petrified girl who's running from the cult to avoid being sacrificed	 Michael is drawn even deeper into an occult conspiracy. Satanic cults and the carnal sacrifice of young women are typical British horror topics	 but David Fischer's screenplay is never dull and offers plenty of neat plot twits	 among which a highly inventive climax. There's also plenty of tension to admire	 the dialogs are wit and the acting performances are splendid (especially John Carson as the leader of the cult is genuinely eerie). Recommended!"	1.0
"When you typically watch a short film your always afraid that the person creating the film tries to throw too much into it. That's not the case with this one.

"Before I begin	 you need to know that I am a huge fan of many of Sonny Chiba's films. His biographical series of the life of his master	 Mas Oyama	 were amazing and among the best martial arts films ever made	 as were most of his Street Fighter films. The action was practically non-stop and with the possible exception of Bruce Lee (depending on who you ask)	 he was the greatest martial arts practitioner on film during the 1970s. Because they are so good	 I've seen at least 15 of his films and recently bought some more (which I am in the process of watching).<br /><br />Unfortunately	 despite my love of these films	 I am NOT a mind-numbed zombie who worships the man to such a degree that I rate EVERY film a 10. There are a few reviews like this here on IMDb and I truly think that anyone giving this film a 10 should be ignored because this is such a bad film from a technical standpoint and isn't even close to the being Chiba's best work. A score of 10 isn't a real rating--it's some zombie fan trying to make a statement about Chiba	 not this film! As I said	 technically this film is awful. Some of this was the result of my seeing the American dubbed version	 with its irrelevant prologue and bad dubbing. But most of the problem would still exist with the original Japanese print. The camera-work is simply atrocious--like it was done by chimps (smart chimps	 but still chimps nonetheless). Often	 much of the fast martial arts action is missed because the camera is so slow or the tops of the actors heads are clipped off due to the shoddiness of production. And	 again and again	 the camera pans in and out like it is a new toy being used by an idiot plus the editing is beyond wretched--with cuts being done haphazardly and confusingly.<br /><br />I don't know whether the musical score is original or not--but it was also very	 very bad. Sort of like acid rock of 1970 blended poorly with Ennio Morricone's ""Spaghetti Western"" music--it was annoying	 distracting and just plain silly.<br /><br />As for the martial arts action	 I think that having chimps do the choreography would have improved things a bit. Instead of the great fight scenes you'd look forward to in a Chiba film	 the fights are too brief and often missed by the camera!! So what you are left with is the story...and this MIGHT just be the worst part of the film! It's supposed to be an anti-drug film starring Sonny Chiba as....Sonny Chiba! And when the film begins	 he vows to destroy the drug trade in Japan. But	 the Mafia (complete with not a single member who looks Italian	 but who are ALL Japanese) vows to stop Chiba. And	 when a lady comes to Chiba with promises to give him information about how to destroy the drug trade	 he agrees to help her and risk his life with no conditions--even though she's NEVER forthright about telling him what she knows! In fact	 later it turns out she is just trying to use Chiba to protect her while she herself sells a huge briefcase full of cocaine--and he CONTINUES trying to protect her!! This makes no sense at all and throughout much of the film it looks as if they just shot the film without a script--such as when they went into the bars and brothels and had Chiba walking about as if he was drunk.<br /><br />So if it was THAT bad	 why still does it merit a 3? Well	 first	 there are many more horrid marital arts films (such as many of those from Hong Kong in the 1970s)--including one with guys dressed up in gorilla suits doing kung fu and their handlers with 3 foot long tongues they used for fighting (now THAT'S bad). Second	 while the action is very bad compared to other Sonny Chiba films	 compared to its contemporaries	 it's not that bad. Still	 you could easily do a lot better than this horrid little film.<br /><br />By the way	 if you are wondering if this is the worst Sonny Chiba film	 it certainly is not! In one of his first films	 INVASION OF THE NEPTUNE MEN	 Chiba plays a leotard-wearing super-hero who battles pointy-headed invaders from the planet Neptune. It's so bad that it rivals PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and THEY SAVED HITLER'S BRAIN for awfulness.<br /><br />A final note to parents--Like most of Sonny Chiba's films	 this one is very violent and has its share of boobies. DON'T let little kids watch this no matter how much they beg! Make them wait until they are older before you let them watch wretched rated-R martial arts films!"	0.0
"I look around in the video store still in shock how Steven Seagal with his track record of Bad action movies can still have 3 movies hit the shelves in less than a Year.Attack force being the 3rd no less promised the first-time entrance into the Sci Fi Genre for our ever widening Seagal.Visions of bad movie entertainment flashed before my gullible eyes.Sadly this is not the case one bit with no entertainment and a movie as bad as they come.<br /><br />Seagal rebounded a tiny bit with the Trashy-but enjoyable Shadow Man last time we saw him.However Attack force has to be his absolute worst movie ever!Don't argue for out for a Kill	Ticker	or even Black Dawn folks.This is the bottom of the Septic tank here.<br /><br />Anyone who says this is Steven Seagal's return to form should be forced to write a 100 page essay on the word Taste. <br /><br />Seagal is yet another agent/I'm a supreme bad-ass yet again named Lawson wants revenge for the killing of his Team that leads him to a nefarious plot to distribute a really bad drug to the unsuspecting public.Not to mention the dealers are not from around here.<br /><br />The whole Production from Directing to the acting is poor.Was this movie shot in the Dark?Its gotta be the most poorly lighted movie since Howling 2.The action is terrible and very badly done.<br /><br />The Producers have also unwisely decided to do what the fans hate the most:throw in stunt double after stunt double and horribly dubbed Steven Seagal.Who seems to show little enthusiasm here.Can ya blame him?<br /><br />While it has been said that Attack Force was not the movie Stevie signed on for(originally Harvester)and surely has to be better than Attack force.The post-production tampering has not made it more coherent and made Seagal look worse.I feel bad for Directer Michael Keusch and writer Joe Halpin as they are gonna be judged forever for the ill-advised production re-shoots.<br /><br />So Now This leaves Seagal in the impossible position to come up with something to atone for this mess.But after seeing how bad Attack Force has turned out do we really want him to make another movie?"	0.0
"First off I must stress how rare it is that I take the time to comment on a movie that I have seen	 it takes a very special case for me to take the time and write about how I felt about a film. That said	 of the hundreds of movies I have watched I have seen some of the most brilliant	 Shawshank	 the scariest	 The Woman in Black	 the funniest	 Shark Attack III: Megaladon	 and now the worst: Vampires vs. Zombies.<br /><br />The first thing that must be said is that this movie is not funny! For those that are looking for a light hearted movie that will just be fun or at the very least so bad that it's funny	 look elsewhere. It is true that a movie such as this is not trying to be subtle and brilliant	 with a title such as this you should know what you're getting into. That said	 there is no excuse for a movie to abandon any and every rule that governs the movie making world. This is not an argument between the traditional movie making process and newer and more ""artsy"" methods to creating a film	 this is an argument between bad directors and companies being held accountable for making terrible movies.<br /><br />This movie suffers from the over used saying ""I don't know where to start."" Truly everything about this movie is broken. From the acting and to the editing there is no reason any movie should ever fail to deliver a cohesive series of events such as Vampires vs. Zombies. Some of the following problems are; 1. Scene misfires- It's clear that the director	 the camera crew and the actors were not on the same page. In one scene in particular the scene begins with the camera resting on the ground looking at the passenger side door of a car. You are expecting the person inside to get out	 but there is a	 and this is NO exaggeration	 10 second	 at least	 delay between the camera comes on and the director says ""action"" to where anything happens on screen. The viewer is left staring at a car door for the entire time with no sound	 no movement	 just the stereotypical ""dead air"" that radio or TV commentators dread. Where was the editing? 2. Acting- A forgivable offense in most cases	 you can't expect a movie like this to have Oscar winners after all	 but Vampires vs. Zombies takes bad acting to a whole other level. These ""actors"" were barely able to read their scripts obviously because anyone with any ability to read and to speak would have been able to pronounce the lines better than these fools. My only comparison for acting would have to be the opening scene from Resident Evil on Playstation. But that acting was even better.<br /><br />3- Story- Wait	 what? Story? Again you can't expect this to be The Greatest Story Ever Told	 but is it too much to ask that we have some semblance of a narrative? Why the Vampires? Who are the characters? Who are the bad guys? Are there good guys? Why all the lesbians? But most importantly	 what's the deal with the zombies? If you have seen this movie then you will understand what I mean	 but to those who haven't I'll be plain	 there are no zombies in this movie aside from maybe five minutes of it. It was almost as if the director forgot about the name of the movie and was forced to throw some zombies in without explanation at the very end.<br /><br />There's so much more	 but I hope I've done enough to keep anyone from seeing this movie."	0.0
"Well	 it's all been said about this movie and I hate it when writing reviews where everyone else already said what's to be said. But the thing is	 I have seen zillions of movies and I am working on writing reviews on all the movies that I've seen. So	 I have to write something.<br /><br />The acting is stupid. It's truly stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness towards the plane crash. The nun is nice though and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child. the three main killings in the movie are just so weak that you wonder how stupid can the makers of this movie be. Don't they realize that even rip-offs can still be scary. We don't see how the granpa is killed. The dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserve to die	 you just don't sympathize with them. And uncle tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been worked better. We just hear him scream and we see nothing!"	0.0
"Deliverance is the fascinating	 haunting and sometimes even disturbing tale by James Dickey	 turned into a brilliant movie by John Boorman. It's about four businessmen	 driven by manhood and macho-behavior	 who're spending a canoeing weekend high up in the mountains. Up there	 they're faced with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human misery...poverty	 buggery and even physical harassment! These four men intended to travel down the river for adventure and excitement but their trip soon changes into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountain-land	 completely estranged from all forms of civilisation. All these elements actually make Deliverance one of the most nightmarish films I've ever seen. Just about everything that happens to these men	 you pray that you'll never find yourself to be in a similar situation. Pure talking cinema	 Deliverance is a very important movie as well. John Boorman's best (closely followed by Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and still is - a very influential film and it contains several memorable scenes that already featured in numberless other movies. Just think about the terrific ""Duelling banjos"" musical score and	 of course	 the unforgettable homosexual ""squeal like a pig"" rape scene. All the actors deliver (haha) perfect acting performances. Especially Jon Voight. A must see motion picture!!"	1.0
"PROBLEM CHILD is one of the worst movies I have seen in the last decade! This is a bad movie about a savage boy adopted by two parents	 but he gets into trouble later. That Junior can drive Grandpa's car. He can scare people with a bear. He can put a room on fire! It is a bad movie as much as BATTLEFIELD EARTH. A sequel is an even worse fate. Rent CHICKEN RUN instead.<br /><br />*1/2 out of **** I give it."	0.0
"This movie really has no beginning or end. And it's really VERY unbelievable. Mary-K and Ashley are supposed to be interns working in a mailing room for an Italian fashion company. But	 for some reason	 they're put up in a 5-star hotel (conveniently located across the street from the Coliseum)	 and all of the other interns they work with are just as abnormally model-looking as they are. One thing that I found obvious in this movie is the way that one of the twins DOESN'T end up with the guy. I guess they tried to twist their usual plot a bit. Nice try."	0.0
"""Girlfight"" follows a project dwelling New York high school girl from a sense of futility into the world of amateur boxing where she finds self esteem	 purpose	 and much more. Although the film is not about boxing	 boxing is all about the film. So much so you can almost smell the sweat. Technically and artistically a good shoot with an sense of honesty and reality about it	 ""Girlfight"" is no chick flick and no ""Rocky"". It is	 rather	 a very human drama which even viewers who don't know boxing will be able to connect with."	1.0
"What an extraordinary crime thriller!! My wife and I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival. It's already my second favourite film of all-time after DR. STRANGELOVE and I was definitely on an emotional high as I walked home and discussed the film with my wife.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the plot because thrillers of this calibre are best enjoyed without preconceptions. A synopsis that I'd feel comfortable sharing is that two brothers	 played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke	 are planning to rob a jewellery store in Westchester	 New York. The film bounces back and forth in time over approximately a two week period of time (before	 during and after the robbery)	 and one key scene is repeated at least three times. Ordinarily	 that could disrupt the momentum of a film but that never happens during this masterpiece. The excitement	 the tension	 and even the quality of the acting only seemed to get better as the film progressed. By the end	 I was on the edge of my seat breathlessly waiting to see how it would all wrap up. I know that I've used a few clichés in this post	 but I literally was on the edge of my seat. I should mention that the non-linear storyline is quite easy to follow. This isn't the sort of movie where you'll overhear audience members asking their friend to explain the plot during the movie.<br /><br />The acting is absolutely brilliant all-around	 and I doubt I would have the same admiration for the film if the casting hadn't been so perfect. A tiny complaint is that Hoffman and Hawke don't look like brothers	 but that's a minor quibble that I can easily overlook. Hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with Hawke were positively electric. Marisa Tomei (as Hoffman's wife) and Albert Finney (as the father of Hoffman & Hawke) are also very good in supporting roles. Even some cameo performances were so impressive that I can still remember every remark	 gesture and facial expression by Brian O'Byrne and Michael Shannon  absolute perfection. The robbery scene felt more authentic than any other cinematic robbery scene I've ever watched	 and I had the same feeling of authenticity in most scenes	 especially the ones with Hoffman. The music helped to build up the tension throughout the movie	 often the same notes played over very effectively. I had the music playing in my head the following day	 even as I sat through other films. In addition to my minor complaint at the beginning of this paragraph	 there was one plot twist that felt a bit unbelievable (major spoiler	 so I can't describe the scene). Otherwise	 this film is pretty darn close to perfect.<br /><br />There were about a dozen great films at the festival that I would enjoy watching a second time but BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD stands in a league of its own. As an aside	 the director Sidney Lumet spoke before the film and he introduced Marisa Tomei and Ethan Hawke onto the stage. Tomei didn't speak and she acted a bit shy so Lumet asked ""Can you believe that someone so beautiful could be so camera-shy?"" That comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene!!"	1.0
"You will recognize the plot immediately. Daughters of a divorced couple trying to get Mom and Dad back together again. Yes	 that was the theme of The Parent Trap in the 60s	 80s and 90s. But here's the spooky thing. Even though Deanna Durbin was younger than the 21 year old Hayley Mills while playing the doting daughter(s) roles	 Durbin looks much older	 as in adult. And so do all of her so-called siblings. <br /><br />And this confusion between adult and child goes throughout the film. The girls are dressed in cute little sailor outfits but look ridiculous in them as the director seems to take pains to point out their ample tops and tushies throughout the film. So you're constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women. When Ray Milland and others start ""hitting on"" them you get the feeling as if they're pedophiles	 and you might be one	 too for noticing those tushies and tops the director was pointing out. Teens or temptresses	 little girls or little foxes	 you are never quite sure what you're supposed to be thinking of them as.<br /><br />The parents	 too	 seem very old and the whole film seems very dated.<br /><br />It is a rusty version of the Parent Trap and you should avoid it	 or at least ensure your tetanus shots are up to date if you don't believe me."	0.0
"I didn't think it was possible for a horror comedy film to fail so abysmally on both fronts....really awful.

On the upshot though.....the MST3K version	 as always	 has a few laughs...."	0.0
"Great Woody Allen? No. Good Woody Allen? Definitely. I found myself	 along with the audience in attendance	 laughing hard and often at some of the best Woody Allen lines we've heard in a while. The aging Allen created an appropriate role for himself as Scarlett Johansson's ""father"" ... well	 sort of. Some have said Johansson plays ""a young Dianne Keaton."" I beg to differ. She plays Woody's dialogue	 which	 in his comedies	 always has a very similar feel...like	 well	 a Woody Allen comedy. That's fine for us Woody appreciators. She certainly did Woody's dialogue far better than the young cast of his last comedy	 Melinda/Melinda. Some may find Woody's humor tiresome	 but for those of us who love it when it's done right	 we look forward to the next."	1.0
"I was really	 really disappointed with this movie. it started really well	 and built up some great atmosphere and suspense	 but when it finally got round to revealing the ""monster""...it turned out to be just some psycho with skin problems......again. Whoop-de-do. Yet another nutjob movie...like we don't already have enough of them.<br /><br />To be fair	 the ""creep"" is genuinely unsettling to look at	 and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes are pretty creepy	 but I'm sick of renting film like this only to discover that the monster is human	 albeit a twisted	 demented	 freakish one. When I saw all the tell-tale rats early on I was hoping for some kind of freaky rat-monster hybrid thing...it was such a let down when the Creep was revealed.<br /><br />On top of this	 some of the stuff in this movie makes no sense. (Spoiler) <br /><br />Why the hell does the Creep kill the security Guard? Whats the point	 apart from sticking a great honking sign up that says ""HI I'm A PSYCHO AND I LIVE DOWN HERE!""? Its stupid	 and only seems to happen to prevent Franka Potente's character from getting help.<br /><br />what the hells he been eating down there? I got the impression he was effectively walled in	 and only the unexpected opening into that tunnel section let him loose...so has he been munching rats all that time	 and if so why do they hang around him so much? Why is he so damn hard to kill? He's thin	 malnourished and not exactly at peak performance...but seems to keep going despite injuries that are equivalent to those that .cripple the non-psycho characters in the film.<br /><br />The DVD commentary says we are intended to empathise with Creep	 but I just find him loathsome. Its an effective enough movie	 but it wasted so many opportunities that it makes me sick."	0.0
"Prior to this release	 Neil LaBute had this to say about the 1973 original: ""It's surprising how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack. I'm like	 come on! You may not like the new one	 but if that's your favorite soundtrack	 I don't know if I *want* you to like my film."" <br /><br />Neil	 a word. You might want to sit down for this too; as Lord Summerisle says	 shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent. See	 Neil	 the thing about the original	 is that Paul Giovanni's soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it. The filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical. Along with Richard and Danny Thompson	 and Bert Jansch	 it practically kick-started the 1970s Folk New Wave. To undermine it is akin to imagining Jaws without John Williams. Or The Buddy Holly Story without Buddy Holly. The result's one of the most breathtakingly arrogant	 pointless remake of a British cult classic since Sly Stallone's Get Carter.<br /><br />The original had apparently left Nicolas Cage ""disturbed for about two weeks."" So disturbed	 during that fortnight's window	 that he pitched the idea of re-imagining one of the most nuanced films about inter-faith struggle ever devised to a writer-director previously known for his wholly unsubtle depictions of male chauvinism. It's like some parlor game: what would you get if Sam Peckinpah took on Bambi? Or Gaspar ""Irreversible"" Noe remade Love	 Actually?(Actually	 I'd quite like to see that). Unfortunately	 someone took this parlor game seriously: All LaBute's succeeded in doing is ripping out the original's guts while saddling it with his own gormless Sex War preoccupations.<br /><br />After failing to rescue a little girl and her mum from a fatal car crash	 Cage's highway patrolman spirals into a medicated torpor. Then he receives a letter from ex-fiancée Willow Woodward (this one trades on name-homages for kudos)	 now living on the private island community of Summersisle  that extra 's' stands for 'superfluous'  and wants Edward to help locate missing daughter Rowan.<br /><br />Summersisle	 it transpires	 is a female-dominated joint	 conceived as a haven for oppressed womenfolk and refugees from the Salem witch trials. Here	 the matriarchs observe the Olde ways	 and the few males are near-mute breed-mules. It's like Lilith Fair on a grand scale. Summersisle's main export is honey  a symbolic and literal headache for Edward	 as he's allergic to bees. ""Beekeepers!"" cries Edward. ""They seem to be everywhere on this island!"" Well	 that's probably because Summersisle's main export is honey.<br /><br />While making his investigations	 Edward overhears of an oncoming Mayday ritual called ""the time of death and rebirth"". He discovers the previous year's crop failed; nearly dies from bee stings; and eventually comes to the conclusion (a conclusion which admittedly couldn't be more obvious if the locals had tattooed a timetable of events on the back of his hands) that Rowan will be burnt alive in a pagan rite to ensure a bountiful harvest. He also meets the Queen Bee of the hive	 Sister Summersisle (Burstyn)	 who has her own plans for him involving the eponymous Wicker Man: ""The drone must die."" <br /><br />First	 the good news: any concerns Cage would be airlifted from the Wicker Man's flaming jaws at the last minute by a fleet of black CIA helicopters can be laid to rest: he toast. That's about it for the good news. ""This is a story whose chapters were carefully written"" intones Burstyn with sublime irony. Though retaining the basic cat-and-mouse premise (and credits typography)	 what's left subjects the original to a scorched-earth policy.<br /><br />Crucial to Shaffer's original screenplay was that his Christian copper	 in accordance with ritual	 came to the island of his own free will  and most importantly	 was a virgin; the perfect sacrifice. In reducing matters to a sexual	 as opposed to a religious power-struggle	 LaBute presents the flimsiest of qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice. By the time Cage has worked out he was the bait	 you honestly couldn't care less.<br /><br />And Cage is one of the very worst things in this; a lumbering	 drawling donkey  an arsewit whose tongue seems just slightly too big for his mouth. ""Goddamit"" he moans after he hallucinates a drowned Rowan	 with all the mental torment of a man who's set his morning alarm clock half-an-hour too early. One hopes it's his character's frequent reliance on pills that has reduced him to this state  alternately fatigued	 then full of preppy	 overbearing vim. If so	 it's a fine portrayal of an undistinguished IQ addled with anti-depressants. If not it doesn't bear thinking about. As Willow	 the saucer-eyed Beahan is similarly dreadful	 presenting her lines as if in competition with Cage for the most half-hearted delivery. While Burstyn entirely lacks the mercurial menace to convince. Who's afraid of Naomi Wolf? <br /><br />Every element that made the original great  the lovingly detailed depictions of folk customs	 the ingenious score	 the dialogue (Lord Summerisle's majestic ""You did it beautifully!"" has been replaced with the rather less attractive ""You did it excellently!"" Whoah	 dude!)  have been substituted for a meandering battle-of-the-sexes thriller with occasional crash-bang wallop. Namely	 walloping women; this is a LaBute flick	 after all. Cage's Sister Beech bashing is just one of the more embarrassing episodes; impotent little men will be hooting with glee at how them uppity hippie chicks finally got what was comin' to 'em	 hyuk hyuk.<br /><br />The closing coda sees the whole rotten mess collapsing under the weight of genre cliché: in a bar	 two guys run into a couple of Summersisle maidens on shore leave	 flirty-fishing for fresh martyrs. At the moment of their successful pick-up	 you half expect the women to turn round and give an exaggerated wink and a thumbs up to the camera.<br /><br />One more thing: keen credit watchers may have noticed that films sporting an unusually high producer count (anything up to 10) tend to be Not Much Cop. The Wicker Man has 18 producers in total."	0.0
"Men of Honor has many great aspects to it. Good action sequences	 plenty of ""feel good"" scenes	 a good musical score	 but the part that really makes the movie is the great acting. Mostly by Robert Deniro. The story of Men of Honor is focused about Carl Brashear played by Cuba Gooding Jr. who wants to be the first African American deep sea diver in the navy. It chronicles his rough struggle from being a poor farmer to getting into diving school and even further. It is a good story	 but it seems like it has been done many times before. A person	 against all of the odds	 won't give up until they accomplish their goals that they set for some sentimental reason many years ago. It could happen	 but a lot of the struggles the Brashear faces in the movie are questionable including the C.O. of the diving school tampering with his final test. However	 all of that is made up for the scene when Robert Deniro finally enters the movie. Deniro plays Mater Chief Sunday who is the teacher at the diving school Brashear is attending. As soon as Deniro come in he omits this vibe of extreme arrogance that you can't hate unless you have incredible wilpower. Before the movie ends	 Deniro gives off multiple speeches that would have you laughing at how cool he is but you are too stunned at the way he punches them out. In the end you must doubt some of the aspects of the film	 but admit it	 if it was all the truth	 it would have you snoozing it your seat by the first twenty minutes."	1.0

I suppose it is 'funny' that Luke's even uglier/dorkier/stupider friend is around	 but well	 that is what we get.<br /><br />Neither of the female leads would ever	 EVER talk to any of the males in this movie for more than 5 minutes. What we get is them sobbing and crying and fighting and so on over 2 guys that were best described in Friday the 13th 4. Dead *@$#"	0.0
"No wonder Pamela Springsteen gave up acting to become a full-time photographer; it's a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one. While this movie is not without its interesting elements (mullets from hell	 etc.)	 it is outweighed by flaws. For one thing	 Angela	 the murderous counselor	 appears to be about the same age as the campers. Having an older	 more threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film. And then you have the murder scenes. The budget was apparently too low to execute most of them properly (no pun intended)	 although drowning someone in an outhouse toilet is certainly original. But overall	 there are a ton of movies out there that are scarier/more fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching."	0.0
"Some comments here on IMDb have likened Dog Bite Dog to the classic Cat III films of the 90s	 but although it is undoubtedly brutal	 violent and very downbeat	 this film from Pou-Soi Cheang isn't really sleazy	 lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison. However	 it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch	 particularly if gritty	 hard-edged action is your thing.<br /><br />Edison Chen plays Pang	 a Cambodian hit-man who travels to Hong Kong to assassinate the wife of a judge; Sam Lee is Wai	 the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down	 whatever the cost. With Wai closing in on his target	 Pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escapeuntil he meets Yue	 a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse.<br /><br />A relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography	 amazing sound design	 a haunting score	 and solid performances from Chen and Lee (as well as newcomer Pei Pei as Pang's love interest)	 Dog Bite Dog is one for fans of hard-hitting Asian hyper-violence (think along the lines of Chan-wook Park's Vengeance trilogy). Stabbings	 shootings	 merciless beatings: all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director Cheang.<br /><br />Of course	 this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved	 and sure enough	 pretty much everyone in this film dies (rather nasty deaths). Unfortunately	 there is a fine line between tragedy and (unintentional) comedy	 and in its final moments	 Dog Bite Dog crosses it: in a laughably over-dramatic final scene	 Pang and Wai are locked in battle as a pregnant Yue looks on. Eventually	 after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas	 a wounded Pang performs a DIY Ceasarean on (a now dead) Yue	 delivering their baby moments before he himself dies.<br /><br />Whilst this film might not be a 'classic' slice of Hong Kong excess	 with its deliriously OTT action and stylish visuals	 it's still worth seeking out."	1.0
"If this is all the Watchowski's have to offer in terms of a back story to the Matrix	 than I really have to question the claims of all of the fans who believe that the movies are intended to register on a deeper level. The second renaissance	 while visually stunning & beautiful is	 story-wise cliched & ludicrous. How many times have we heard the story of humans relying too much on technology	 humans all-too eager to make war	 humans basically destroying themselves? There is nothing new here. And I have another question. Considering the plot of the second renaissance	 doesn't that make the machines the good guys?! The machines are oppressed for generations by their cruel human overmasters. They fight back	 win their freedom and seek to establish a peaceful harmonious coexistence with the humans	 who reject them in favor of all-out war	 which the cleverer machines naturally win. If this is the back-story	 then we shouldn't be rooting for Neo	 we should be rooting for the machines! The humans were cruel and oppressive	 while the machines were courageous and attepted to be compassionate. Since I do not believe that the Watchowski's intend for us to favor the machines over the humans	 I have to believe that the Second Renaissance was simply a misguided attempt @ creating a back-story."	0.0

"I began watching a replay of this TV movie on a Sunday afternoon	 thinking it was just another dumb airplane disaster flick. I was wrong.<br /><br />""Pandora's Clock"" is an intelligent political thriller that is far beyond the quality of most TV movies. It could just as easily have made its debut on the big screen.<br /><br />The cast is excellent	 including veteran actors Richard Dean Anderson	 Edward Herrmann	 Robert Guillaume	 and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga turns in one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the CIA	 and Frasier's Jane Leeves is also very good. <br /><br />The dialogue is well-written and the story is compelling throughout.

"The first time I ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a wee lad. My dad actually recorded it off the TV. I must have watched is over 20 times	 before the relatively recent release on DVD.<br /><br />I of course bought and watched the DVD and was taken aback by how much the dialogue had changed. In the first version	 which I still have on VHS	 the mood of the film	 thanks to the dialogue	 was actually very dark. However the new version	 featuring Van Der Beek et al	 is more comic.<br /><br />To put it another way	 it's like watching the original US release of Akira with that dub	 before watching the remastered version with the literal translation of the Japanese.<br /><br />I'm in no way complaining	 the story and quality of animation are not detracted from	 but it does raise the question of whether Miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film....."	1.0
"I am a kung fu fan	 but not a Woo fan. I have no interest in gangster movies filled with over-the-top gun-play. Now	 martial arts; *that's* beautiful! And John Woo surprised me here by producing a highly entertaining kung fu movie	 which almost has *too much* fighting	 if such a thing is possible! This is good stuff.<br /><br />Many of the fight scenes are very good (and some of them are less good)	 and the main characters are amusing and likable. The bad guys are a bit too unbelievably evil	 but entertaining none the less. You gotta see the Sleeping Wizard!! He can only fight when he's asleep - it's hysterical!<br /><br />Upon repeated viewings	 however	 Last Hurrah For Chivalry can tend to get a little boring and long-winded	 also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not that good. Hence	 I rate it ""only"" a 7 out of 10. But it really is almost an ""8"".<br /><br />All in all one of the better kung fu movies	 made smack-dab in the heart of kung fu cinema's prime. All the really good kung fu movies are from the mid- to late 1970ies	 with some notable exceptions from the late '60ies and early '70ies (and early '80ies	 to be fair)."	1.0
"Grieving couple move to a cabin on a mountain after the loss of their daughter	 discovering that there may be ghosts haunting the place	 restless spirits of past occupants who committed suicide. Julie Pyke(Cheri Christian)blames husband Allen(Greg Thompson)for the horrible death of their daughter due to leaving the door unlocked and the marriage has deteriorated because of it. Julie remains in a zombie state	 eliciting next to no emotion	 remote and numb	 only photographing a nearby abandoned prison	 finding a startling image of a ghoul girl clinging to the bars of a cell. Though Allen doesn't see anything out of the ordinary	 Julie continues to take pictures and we can recognize that something isn't quite right. A local handyman	 Jim Payne(Scott Hodges)	 a rather distant fellow who harbors a secret becomes a dangerous threat when it is revealed that his dead mother might have something to do with the haunts occurring to the Pykes. Meanwhile the neighbors who sold the Pykes the cabin find themselves victims as well	 alcoholic Mr Booth's abuse to his wife coming back to haunt him. Allen will conduct an investigation into the history of his cabin	 attempting to unravel the mystery about the place.<br /><br />Plenty of ghosts moving about in the background in this somber supernatural tale with practically every character miserable. Cheri Christian remains so vacuous and lost	 it's incredibly hard to connect with her despite the fact that you understand her plight. The acting	 as is often mentioned	 remains frustrating because none of the characters exactly are easy to latch on to. I guess it's supposed to be this way	 under their circumstances	 but the trouble I had was never being able to properly embrace the Pykes due to their constant state of aloofness. Cheri comes off as cold and detached	 as I figure a mother would tend to be when you lose a child in such a way	 but the icy nature left me pleading inside to embrace her which I just never could. I think the right performers	 even if the characters are going through an emotional turmoil	 can grab the hearts of their viewers	 if a humanity reaches out to us..in this movie's case	 the leads are unable to do so	 for whatever reason. It could've been me	 I don't know. I wanted to care for them	 but nothing in the characters tugged on my heart strings. Anyway	 as the film continues	 Allen slowly uncovers certain truths and must defend himself against his wife who has convinced herself that their daughter is among them and she won't lose her little girl again. Jim	 the unstable neighbor who believes that to stop the hauntings plaguing the area he must kill the Pykes	 becomes a vital threat. The ghosts remain a central part of the movie	 their presence	 particularly Jim's mother	 established throughout	 off in the distance. The finale reveals all of them as Allen must find help for his wife while trying to thwart Jim's mission. I had a hard time getting into this one due to my unease with the leads and their characters."	0.0
"'Iedereen Beroemd' has everything we can expect from a straight to video-movie. It's the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star. The only thing he needs is to get her on stage	 surrounded by cameras and reporters. A simple plan for which he has to kidnap and do some blackmail. The problem with the movie is not the basic plot	 but how it is made. Everything is supposed to be funny	 but it isn't. It is trivial and clumsy	 the characters are shallow	 and the end-sequence is totally without climax or emotion. The last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing	 but only at how pathetic the whole set-up is."	0.0
"Priyadarshan- whenever a person heard his name	 his first thought would be 'comedy'. That is what this man is known for	 or rather	 was known for. After giving stupendous blockbuster comedies like Hungama	 Hera Pheri and Hunchul	 his train derailed slowly with movies like Chupke Chupke and a few others whose names I can't recollect for now. Now with hideous films like Dhol	 the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be- 'torture'.<br /><br />Dhol is a mixture of bad	 unfunny toilet jokes	 somewhat of drama	 poor suspense and idiocracy. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two of the scenes which were funny	 though not witty	 and secondly	 except for Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandma	 the acting was decent. <br /><br />Speaking of the acting	 I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top (if you compare them with the others in the movie)	 then came Tusshar Kapoor	 then Tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above. The flaw in Kunal Khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting. The grandma	 firstly resembled a ghost	 plus she was not funny at all but rather silly.<br /><br />The plot was the same	 seen before one. Four boys behind girls and in need of money	 but with a few twists. There is a 'bad' man who is preposterously stupid and dumb. And at last	 the good wins over the bad and everything is fine. The idea of having a Dhol with a tone full of cash in it is simply not witty.<br /><br />The worst thing about the movie is its length. After an hour or so	 you get exhausted and want to leave the theater. But being a critic	 it is my responsibility to tolerated the whole two and half hours of the movie. THe movie goes on and on and the same kind of jokes are repeated again and again and the situations are perennial just at a different place.<br /><br />If your mother-in-law has arrived to your house and starts mocking you at everything	 then send her for this movie and have fun. 3 out of 10."	0.0
"OK I caught this film halfway through	 but.oh.dear.god.it.sounds.like.they're.all.reading.from.scripts.<br /><br />Especially that guy who is now in Teachers and the Book Group	 although at least he has proved that he can act if he wants to! (the part where someone has a heart attack stands out as a bastion of bad film making both in terms of acting	 scripting and general plausibility) It quite clearly appears to be a cash-in on Human Traffic	 but whilst that is not the best film ever	 it is at least original and had actors whose delivery did not resemble that of earnest-yet-hopeless GCSE students trying to get a pass grade. Not so much as Human Traffic as a bit of a car crash!"	0.0
"What a strangely wonderful	 if sometimes slight and bulky	 big-budget fantasy this is. Takashi Miike had already proved	 by the time he got to The Great Yokhai War	 that he could dip into other films aside from his supposed niche of the crime/yakuza genre (Visitor Q and Andromedia showed this	 the former great the latter lesser). But here Miike	 in his first and only co-screen writing credit no less	 proves that he can deliver the goods on a post-modern soup of mythical fantasy conventions	 and with it boatload of CGI	 creature-effects and make-up	 and an epic battle that is more like a ""festival"" than something out of Lord of the Rings. The comparisons can be made far and wide	 to be sure	 and the most obvious to jump on would be Miyazaki	 for the seemingly unique mixture of kids-as-big-heroes	 power-hungry sorcerers looking for the energy of the earth as the main source	 machinery as the greatest evil	 and many bizarrely defined	 flamboyantly designed creatures (or Yokai of the title). But there can also be comparisons made to Star Wars	 especially to the Gungan battle in TPM	 and to the whole power-play between good and evil with similar forces. Or to anime like Samurai 7. Or	 of course	 to Henson's films. And through all of these comparisons	 and even through the flaws or over-reaching moments	 it's Miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters. <br /><br />Here	 Ryunosuke Kamiki plays Tadashi	 the prototypical kid who starts out sort of gullible and sensitive to things in the world	 but will become the hero in a world going into darkness. The darkness is from an evil sorcerer	 who gets his energy from all of the rage and wretched vibes in the human world	 and who is also starting to put to death the spirits and other creatures	 the Yokhai	 into a fire that sends them into gigantic robots that have only one mission- to destroy and kill anything in their paths. Tadashi gets as pumped up to fight Sato the sorcerer as the Yokai once Sato's main minion and cohort	 Agi (Kill Bill's Chiaki Kuriyama	 another great villainies) steals Tadashi's little furry companion	 a Sunekosuri. Soon	 things come to a head	 in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories	 but can only be contained	 up to a point	 by Miike and his crew. I would probably recommend The Great Yokai War for kids	 but in the forward note that it's not some watered down fantasy in American circles. This has creatures galore	 including a one-eyed umbrella stand	 and a walking	 talking wall	 not to mention a turtle	 a fire serpent	 and a woman who became cursed by Sato. So the variety is on high on that end	 and one might almost feel like the creatures and effects- which grows to unfathomable heights when the ""festival"" hits with the Yokai reaching hundreds of miles in scope. But there's also a sense of fantasy being strong in both the light and the dark	 and Sunekosuri becomes perhaps the greatest emotional tool at Miike's disposal (and not just because it's cuteness squared); where else to get an audience riled up than over a little furry ball of fury	 who ends up in a tragic battle with Tadashi in robot form? <br /><br />Yet through all of this	 the sense of anarchy that can be found in the brightest spots of Miike's career is here as well	 which distinguishes it from its animated	 Muppet and sci-fi counterparts. There's the bizarre humor as usual	 including a song dedicated to Akuzi beans at a crucial moment in the climax	 and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes (I loved	 for example	 the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller	 or the anxious turtle-Yokai). The biggest danger with Miike's access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry	 which he flirts with	 is overkill on this end. He's got everything down	 I'm sure	 with storyboards	 and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions (one of them is when all is said and done	 and Tadashi and the 'other' human character are in the middle of the Tokyo rubble in an overhead shot)	 but the CGI is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots	 and the interplay skirts on being TOO flamboyant	 and some visuals	 like the overlay of the Yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map	 just seem weak and pat. I almost wondered if Miike might dip into (bad) Spy Kids territory	 quite frankly.<br /><br />But this liability aside	 The Great Yokai War provides more than a share of excitement	 goofy thrills	 and innocent melodrama that came with many of the best childhood fantasies. It owes a lot to cinema	 as well as traditional Japanese folklore	 but the screws are always turning even in its most ludicrous and veeringly confusing beats. It's not the filmmaker at his very best	 but working in experimentation in a commercial medium ends up working to his advantage. It's got a neat little message	 and lots of cool adventure. 7.5/10"	1.0
"Mary Pickford often stated that Tess Skinner was her favorite movie role. Well said! She played the part twice and for this version which she herself produced	 she not only had to purchase the rights from Adolph Zukor but even give him credit on the film's main title card. Needless to say her portrayal of this role here is most winning. Indeed	 in my opinion	 the movie itself rates as one the all-time great experiences of silent cinema.<br /><br />True	 director John S. Robertson doesn't move his camera an inch from start to finish	 but in Robertson's skillful hands this affectation not only doesn't matter but is probably more effective. A creative artist of the first rank	 Robertson is a master of pace	 camera angles and montage. He has also drawn brilliantly natural performances from all his players. Jean Hersholt who enacts the heavy is so hideously repulsive	 it's hard to believe this is the same man as kindly Dr Christian; while Lloyd Hughes renders one of the best acting jobs of his entire career. True	 it's probably not the way Mrs White intended	 but it serves the plot admirably	 as otherwise we would have difficulty explaining why the dope spent a fortune on defense but made not the slightest attempt to ascertain who actually fired the gun that killed his future brother-in-law! Needless to say	 this particular quality of the likable hero is downplayed by Jack Ging in the bowdlerized 1960 version which also totally deletes the author's trenchant attack on smug	 middle-class Christianity. Notice how the well-washed priest here moves forward a pace or two in surprise at the interruption	 but then makes no attempt whatever to assist our plucky little heroine in the performance of duties that he himself was supposedly ordained to administer. This is a very moving scene indeed because it is so realistically presented.<br /><br />""Tess"" also provides an insight into the work of another fine actress	 Gloria Hope	 whose work was entirely confined to silent cinema. She married Lloyd Hughes in 1921 and retired in 1926 to devote her life completely to her husband and their two children. Lloyd Hughes died in 1958	 but she lived until 1976	 easily contactable in Pasadena	 but I bet no-one had the brains to interview her. Another opportunity lost! <br /><br />To me	 Forrest Robinson only made a middling impression as Skinner. I thought he was slightly miscast and a brief glance at his filmography proves this: He usually played priests or judges! But David Torrence as usual was superb.<br /><br />In all	 an expensive production with beautiful photography and marvelous production values."	1.0
"Just recently	 I've been obsessing over and anticipating this movie so much that I almost had to see it. Well	 having just seen it today	 the 5.8 rating is completely understandable. I think that if you anticipate something so much that it becomes a dire need	 it turns out not to be worth it. <br /><br />Sure	 The Hills Have Eyes 2 has its moments. It has a very cool and well-developed storyline that ties in well with the actual product itself	 but the whole thing is so self-indulged that it becomes so hard to follow. And if it weren't for Wes Craven's production on this film	 it wouldn't be anything to do with The original remake. <br /><br />But the whole thing makes you go ""Is this supposed to be horror or COMEDY?"" because there are lots of ridiculous	 randomly placed jump moments and stupid one liners (I.E. ""There's a hand in the sh**er!"" or ""You motherfu**er! I'll kill you all damn sons of b**tches!"") and the acting (God don't even remind me how bad it was.<br /><br />STORYLINE: (this part contains spoilers	 beware!) The movie begins with a woman giving birth to a mutant baby (ooh la la!)	 and then the screen fades to black with the movie's title appearing	 and a monologue. Then we go to this office where there are randomly placed war veteran mannequins. We find that this is for this one scientist keeping track of people looking for mutants. The box to keep track of audio feeds is gone	 and everyone dies! After that tone-setting opening	 you'd expect more.<br /><br />Then	 we go to this one team of military recruits training in Baghdad. As the captain parades them ""A good job at stupidity""	 their last day of training is in New Mexico	 the desert where the family in the last THHE had stayed because they were stuck. While in training	 things go ultimately wrong	 people die	 and... do I need to tell you any more? Because right now I have the attention span of a goldfish just forcing myself to sit here and type this.<br /><br />The thing that's wrong with THHE2 is that it just dosen't work. No flashbacks here	 and the ending is pretty safe... but with a twist! A stupid one	 that is. I'm pretty sure the Ultra Super Director's Cut with a holographic cover and a ticket to The Hills Have Eyes 3 will showcase all of it's alternate endings	 but at this point	 I'm not sure if I care. <br /><br />So by all means	 if you loved the first THHE so much it's almost a sin not to see this	 then by all means	 see it. But if else	 then	 Avoid at all costs. It's for your own good.<br /><br />3/10"	0.0
"First of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book	 especially when you're dealing with master writer like Tolkien. This ADAPTATION wonderfully synthesizes Tolkien's universe with 1970s psychedelia	 aesthetics	 and liberal culture. Yes - the animation and background painting is sometimes a little ""rough"" in its technical execution but it's beautiful none the less	 and very evocative in terms of giving a unique ""sense of place"" to each of the scenes. Beyond the absolute uniqueness in imagery is the absolutely outstanding voice acting - acting that's FAR superior to the acting in the new live action movies. And while the cell animation might not be the most ""technically proficient"" animation it superbly captures the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting while at once not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced. The background paintings vary from traditional ""fantasy"" motif to outright abstraction	 but the transition to abstracted settings is always motivated by the narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film. If you're a person who has to have extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you then I can see how you might not like this movie but if you enjoy superior acting	 transcendental imagery	 and JRR Tolkien then this film is a must see."	1.0
"I enjoyed this film. But I was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy. It was amusing at times	 but really	 it wasn't very funny at all. If I'd been expecting it to be a comedy	 I might have been disappointed with the film	 but	 going in with no expectations	 I found it to be enjoyable and engaging. Maybe it was because	 as an engineer	 I identified with the protagonist. I was less concerned with satire of capital or labor	 and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention. A man who's less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production. He's absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention. So I find it interesting that people here have compared it to Jurassic Park; me	 I compare it to The Fountainhead."	1.0
"Notable because of it's notorious explicit scene when the gorgeous Maruschka Detmers takes her young lover's penis from his trousers and into her mouth. Even without this moment the film is a splendid if slightly disturbing passionate and blindingly sexy ride. Detmers puts in a great performance as the partly deranged	 insatiable delight	 wandering about her flat nude. Dressed	 partly dressed and naked she steals most of the film about love	 sexual passion	 philosophy and politics. For me the last two get a little lost and the ending is most confusing when her fiancé is released whilst fellow terrorists are released	 she seems uncertain as to who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in his exams than anything else as she weeps	 beautifully of course!"	1.0
"The Odd Couple is a comic gem. One the funniest script ever committed to celluloid - exceeded only by Strangelove	 Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are best friends: obsessive compulsive Felix and sloppy	 irresponsible Oscar. Oscar's wife has already left him because he is impossible to live with due to his irresponsible attitude. Felix's wife leaves him at the start of the movie	 and after an aborted suicide attempt he moves in with poker buddy Oscar. Thats when the fun begins.<br /><br />The entire script is brilliant and filled with brilliant one-liners. You are probably already familiar with the ""F.U."" joke but it still works brilliantly due to Matthau's comic timing.<br /><br />My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to clear his sinus in the diner and when the Pigeon sisters are being charmed by a very suave Matthau and Lemmon is totally out of his element. This one requires repeat viewings!"	1.0
"Oh my	 from the box description I thought it would be LA-crazy like 2 Days in the Valley or Hugo Pool. Ulrich Seidl must be a very strong man. Most	 after directing this	 would have driven off a cliff or at least committed a mass murder. I confess to only watching the first half hour (for now). Reading all the comments here	 I have a lot to look forward to. Professional reviews often mention the Swedish film Songs from the Second Floor as a parallel but that's graced with humor and fantasy and this is unrelenting in its dour realism. What hath the Marshall Plan and the EU wrought? Seeing this in a theater with anyone I know would have only resulted in an enforced departure after many fewer minutes than I got through on DVD. There's a more annoying creature in the universe than Jar Jar Binks - the Hitchhiker from Hell. Whatever happens to her	 it isn't enough! Soulless suburbia that I thought only existed in Arizona and Florida thrives in Lower Austria. Oh no! I thought sex clubs had ceased to exist even in New York and San Francisco	 and here they are in suburban shopping malls? Was it Mahatma Gandhi or Jawaharlal Nehru who said when asked about Western Civilization	 'why that might be a nice idea'? If the world were truly like this film	 bring on that black hole	 we're ready."	1.0
"<br /><br /> What can I say? This is one of the most perfect films ever made. Its a throwback to the glitxy	sterling romantic comedies of the 1940s..but with a modern touch.The screenplay bursts with wit	charm	humor and tenderness	the cinematograpy is breathtaking(NYC never looked so beautiful)	and of course there is the cast! Dudley Moore turns in the performance of his career as Loveable	drunken Arthur Bach. He is also wistful and real..one of the film's best lines is his poignant ""Not Everyone who drinks is a poet...some of us drink because we're not poets."" The great Sir John Gielgud won a much deserved Oscar for his splendid performance as Hobson	Arthur's valet and caretaker.Although He considered it a ""take the money and run role""	He brings to the character all the talent 	experience and bravura of an expert tragidian and a sly comedian. The supporting cast is also out of thisworld	from Geraldine Fitzgerald's sassy Grandma Bach to Stephen Elliott's bombastic Mafioso.<br /><br /> The score is also extremely memorable and compliments the film perfectly.The only real problem with the film is the ill fated sequel it spawned."	1.0

"PROS: Akshay Kumar's performance(is it just me or does this guy always manages to trump AB in their movies together?). Some touching scenes in the 2nd half.<br /><br />CONS: The whole 1st hour(the jokes were flat to say the least). Every scene involving Rajpal Yadav. Major stupidity in AB's decision making. Let me get this straight	 he believes brutally insulting his son's soul in every possible way(that will likely ruin their relationship beyond repair) is a better way for him to make Akshay finally take some responsibility then actually telling him the truth?? WTF? He considers Akshaye is too soft to bear the fact that his OLD father is soon gonna die due to cancer	 but thinks insulting him will make him stronger? Am I the only one who doesn't see the logic here? Easily the movie's biggest flaw.<br /><br />- Akshay becoming a stunt man. LMAO!! We're told he finished 1st in college every year and has a degree in MBA. But when the time arrives to support himself	 and his pregnant wife	 he becomes a stunt man. LOL!! How abt actually applying for a normal job in ur field? Or Heck	 anywhere else where ur life isn't in danger? This is some incredibly dumb writing.<br /><br />- The ending. I hate this sort of melodramatic crap. Everything is pushed down our throats to feel sorry for AB's character	 which I couldn't. The entire thing reminded me a little too much of Srk in KHNH(which I hate). This ""please feel sorry for the guy with the illness"" crap has run its course. I felt more like puking than sympathy for the OLD man. Couldn't watch the final 20 or so minutes because of it and thus had to fast fwd. the whole thing.<br /><br />Bottomline: Waqt is just too dumb to be called a good movie. Its obvious director Vipul Shah targeted this at the emotionally fragile chicas and oldies who could care less about a story that actually makes sense. Give 'em some decent song picturizations	 fancy outfits	 plenty of glycerin-filled scenes and some star power and they'll happily lap-up crap like this."	0.0
"""Diary of Sex Addict"" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsiveness.

Fred's dad	 played by Trevor Peacock (of Vicar of Dibley fame	 amongst others)	 had about one line.<br /><br />The plot was predictable and all over the place	 and the humour was... lacking.

"Today I found ""They All Laughed"" on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS	 I had no information about this movie	 but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich	 Audrey Hepburn	 John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me	 the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb	 and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in ""Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003"" and  wow  four stars! So	 I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed	 I have just finished watching ""They All Laughed"" and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed	 and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing)	 but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences	 in a huge city like New York	 are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man	 with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt	 Antonio Banderas or George Clooney	 is quite ridiculous. In the end	 the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten	 murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie	 and whose life was showed in ""Star 80"" and ""Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story""; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen	 the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful	 even being fifty-two years old	 Audrey Hepburn; and the song ""Amigo""	 from Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like him	 Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as ""The King"". I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Muito Riso e Muita Alegria"" (""Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness"")"	0.0
"""Painting is seeing	 then remembering better than you saw."" So says Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman)	 the painter in The Light That Failed.The movie is in the grand old Hollywood style	 starring Ronald Colman and a bravura supporting cast that includes Ida Lupino in her first important role	 dependable character actor Dudley Digges (who also co-starred with Colman in Condemned.)	and a solid performance by the wonderful actor Walter Huston.<br /><br />The title and opening sequences of the film pretty much give away the fact that Dick will lose his sight. He's blinded by gun powder discharge as he and childhood sweetheart Maisie (Muriel Angelus) are playing with a pistol. Later a wound while fighting in the Sudan is the catalyst for his blindness. He becomes a famous painter	 but he's already blinded by ambition	 and doesn't really reach his full potential until the point that his sight is leaving him. Enter bad girl Bessie (Ida Lupino)	 and his self destruction is set in motion. Lupino is very powerful in this role and plays off Colman very well. Her evil tart reminds me of Bette Davis in Of Human Bondage. <br /><br />Well acted and well directed	 this is one of my favorite Colman melodramas."	1.0

"Lets first start this review with the fact that I SIGNED UP JUST TO WRITE THE REVIEW AND WARN PEOPLE TO SAVE Their MONEY!!<br /><br />This was one of the worst pieces of trash i have seen since The Hulk. The storyline was the most predictable garbage you could possibly come up with. If you are expecting 24 but on the big screen	 flush that expectation down the toilet immediately along with the money you would use for a ticket.. You may get more enjoyment that way. The acting was terrible	 the plot was completely unrealistic	 (along with the so called ""twist"" in the end. I must say this.. The ending did surprise me. I am not referring to the plot twist that surprised me	 but instead the effortless manner that they put together what could be considered the ONLY scene of somewhat decent action in the entire movie. They rushed the ending so quickly that I didn't even realize that it was over until I saw the credits rolling and at that point i considered burning the reel of film if I could just figure out how to get into that screening room.<br /><br />Casting was awful for a few reasons. First of all	 they must have accidentally switched the character assignments	 because Michael Douglas played the roll that CLEARLY Keifer Sutherland should have been playing. While Douglas was sneaking around agents	 tapping phone lines	 hacking into systems and taking out people who are chasing after him	 Sutherland plays the less capable agent who is always in a bad mood even when things aren't going that badly for him. He plays a very bland agent	 nothing like his Jack Bauer type roll us 24 fans love.<br /><br />I can just about promise you that this movie will disappoint in all areas. It can be best compared to a remake of the ""The Fugitive"" / ""In The Line of Fire"" but written by people with mental disabilities"	0.0
"A new creative team emerged in 1950 when brilliant actor James Stewart teamed with the equally-brilliant director Anthony Mann to make a series of westerns that helped define that genre for the future. Until that time Stewart was mainly noted for an aw..aw..aw approach to family oriented comedies	 dramas	 and romances. Not that he wasn't already a multi-talented Hollywood star. One of his best screen performances ever and one of the best for anyone on celluloid was as Macaulay 'Mike' Connor	 a sarcastic writer for a scandal rag in ""The Philadelphia Story."" He had even done westerns before. His portrayal of gun shy yet expert shot Thomas Jefferson Destry Jr. in the comedy western ""Destry Rides Again"" helped make that film a classic. But to most movie goers he was the all-American boyscout type Mr. Smith or George Bailey. Seldom was there a dark side to any of the characters he played. <br /><br />Anthony Mann was associated with B flicks in the film noir mode. ""Raw Deal	"" ""Side Street	"" and ""T-Men"" caught the eye of James Stewart. So the two gifted men combined their resources to produce some of the greatest Hollywood westerns ever made. ""Winchester '73"" and ""The Man from Laramie"" were the best but the others were almost as effective. Mann became a successful director of A films as a result going on to direct what some critics believe to be the greatest western of them all Gary Cooper's ""Man of the West."" Stewart became fabulously wealthy as a result of the partnership because he signed for part of the royalties in return for a fraction of the salary he was usually paid	 a wise move indeed followed by many other actors from then on.<br /><br />Winchester '73 was also one of the first films	 maybe the first	 to tell a story from the standpoint of a traveling gun. Each owner is part of the tale being told and it all comes together in the exciting showdown at the end of the movie	 which also holds a surprise for the viewer. Based on a story by Stuart Lake	 the tale centers on revenge and the ownership of the Winchester '73. The year is 1876. Custer and his 7th cavalry have been annihilated by the Sioux and Cheyenne at Little Big Horn. The whites want revenge. The native Americans want their land and their way of life back. This conflict leads to a confrontation between native Americas led by Young Bull (young Rock Hudson showing his potential as an actor) and a small cavalry group pinned down in a canyon and joined by civilians Lin McAdam (Stewart)	 his partner and life-long pal High Spade ( the underrated actor Millard Mitchell)	 and a couple trying to find themselves	 Steve Miller (Charles Drake) and Lola Manners (Shelley Winters)	 a soiled dove with a kind heart. Among the horse soldiers are newcomers Tony Curtis and James Best (late of the ""Dukes of Hazzard"")	 whose part is cut short by a bullet.<br /><br />Wyatt Earp was in Dodge City in 1876. The movie has him as head marshal. The fine actor Will Geer (later of the Waltons) looks like an older Earp. In reality Wyatt was assistant Marshal in Dodge at the time just cutting his teeth on being a lawman. Lin McAdam wins the Winchester in a shooting contest	 but has it taken from him not long afterward by outlaw Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) and his henchmen. McAdam and High Spade are after both Dutch Henry and the Winchester for the remainder of the movie. An even more sinister character emerges along the way	 Waco Johnnie Dean	 played as evil personified by Dan Duryea who threatens to steal the show from the other members of a stellar cast.<br /><br />The Winchester passes through several hands during the course of the film	 each time the transfer is intense. One involves a gunrunner played to perfection by John McIntire. Other swaps are intermingled with the scenario above. All this plus the action keeps the viewer glued to the seat throughout the entire show.<br /><br />As noted above	 the cast is first rate down to the smallest role. Look for other familiar faces in uncredited parts	 including the future sheriff of ""Bonanza"" Ray Teal and B western reliable Panhandle Perkins (Guy Wilkerson)."	1.0
"........and an extremely bad one at that!!! How long did this train-wreck last?? 14 episodes or something?? I can see why now.<br /><br />I bought the ""Serenity"" episode from Amazon Unboxed. It was my first purchase	 so was free. That is the ONLY good thing about the experience (incident??)<br /><br />I won't comment really on the acting	 since these were	 I guess	 fairly new people who hadn't really gotten the job down just right yet. At least I've never seen them before in any type of major show	 theater or TV. If I did	 then I have easily forgotten them.<br /><br />But the special effects were absolutely horrendous. True	 this isn't exactly a multi-million $$ project	 but the original Star Trek did better than this & that was THIRTY-FIVE YEARS ago. I especially got a laugh out of the bad guys (reapers or something like that) ship as it chased the hilarious looking Firefly	 with smoke coming out of the engines looking something like a gigantic model rocket. I fully expected to eventually see the Wiley Coyote riding on top	 while chasing after the Roadrunner. MODERN jet/rocket engines don't even do it that bad.<br /><br />And that wasn't even the worst of it. The wild-west type shoot-outs had me wondering if I was actually watching a sci-fi film or a Gene Autry one.<br /><br />Regardless of the hype	 don't waste your time...I did...all 80-something minutes of the disaster called ""Firefly""."	0.0
"I bought the DVD of Before Sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago. Having saw it twice	 I couldn't help but missing Before Sunrise	 not because the sequel was not as great	 but I felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did	 every time I finished watching one of them	 I feel the need and yearning to see the other. So	 I ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly	 I will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly. The most remarkable thing about Before Sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other. It sounds so simple	 the growing of the chemistry	 I think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development	 but to me - who doesn't believe in Nora Ephron - Before Sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it. When I saw it for the first time	 about 8 year ago when I was 20	 I already liked it. But	 I didn't rate it as a ""great film""	 it still seemed to me like another thinking persons' feel good movie	 Linklater was too smart to make it more realistic	 it was 10 minutes too long	 the characters was too well fabricated	 I thought I liked it because it was like a dream and because I enjoyed their conversations	 etc. etc.. But now	 thanks to Before Sunset	 I feel that's more to Before Sunrise than what I felt for it before. I saw the elements more clearly: Jesse	 Celine	 Vienna	 their conversations	 everything. How each of them are separated element by itself	 and they have a chance to mix	 the story is just a frame of time	 I am no longer feel manipulated. And the freedom that every scene has	 as well as its refusal to be overly efficient	 how blind I was that those qualities didn't strike me as exceptional when I first saw it! Now	 8 year have passed	 the more movies I've seen	 the more I realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending	 even movies like Pulp Fiction or Linklaters's own Slackers included. The Jesse and Celine tale avoid that	 maybe Before Sunset is a better example in this case	 but Before Sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time	 not a destination	 every single scene has its own life. I don't know whether Linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made Before Sunrise	 but to me	 one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other. Before Sunrise which I think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes	 seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding Jesse and Celine	 the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it. Meanwhile	 I enter the vision of boredom as Jesse stuck talking to the journalists in Before Sunset	 and Celine's first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile I've seen in a beginning of a film	 and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place I don't know with a sadness in me	 no matter how beautiful Paris is	 and no matter how happy I am that they meet again. I'm sorry that I go on this long with my limited English	 Before Sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts	 and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it."	1.0
"/* slight spoilers */<br /><br />Way back	 before Evangelion was made	 before Hideaki Anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans	 and before Gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite	 Gunbuster was made. With only Wings of Honneamise made by Gainax at that time	 and the famous Otakon shorts or course	 Gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up. It didn't make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before	 space opera.<br /><br />Luckily	 Gainax decided to put it out as a six-part OAV (direct to video) series. This allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film. This also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long	 with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way. Besides that	 they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in Macross or Gundam	 and many other popular space operas.<br /><br />For one	 the shows starts out pretty light	 with Noriko in the Okinawa High School for mechapiloting. Noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle	 when she was still a little kid. This makes her life at the academy quite hard	 as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that Noriko is favored by the professors. The first episode is pretty much a comedy drama	 with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school. Things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced	 and Noriko and Kazumi (best girl in class) are chosen to help the assembled fleet out.<br /><br />The middle bulk of Gunbuster leaves our female lead in space	 focusing on both personal drama and action. A couple more characters are introduced	 and parts of Noriko's past are dragged up again. Besides that	 the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute	 and the Gunbuster	 mankind's final hope	 is presented. Smart as writer Okada was	 he incorporated the principles of time dilation	 to spice things up a bit. In short	 time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light. This means that Noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete. Also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated	 when Noriko sees her friends again on her return to base	 who have aged considerably more than her. The science might not be perfect	 but it's presented in a pretty believable way	 with even some SD science theatre shorts in between the episodes	 where Noriko	 Kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series.<br /><br />The animation	 for a series made in the 80s	 is definitely good. The designs are retro 80s style of course	 but it has it's charm. Animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice	 although the costumes do betray<br /><br />some of the fanservice fascination Gainax will later exploit to the fullest. The mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too	 with the Gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine	 strong and vast. The last episode was entirely done in black and white. While it's generally believed (but not confirmed) that this was done for budget reasons	 it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series	 which is suited perfectly for the latter part.<br /><br />The music is very typical space opera fair. Too bombastic in places	 very generic	 and definitely not worth buying. It does fit the series for the most part	 but it can become quite annoying at times. Tanaka is not really a famous composer	 and the only other respectable series he's worked on is Dragon Half. If you think 80s anime music	 you will know what to expect.<br /><br />As the series progresses	 the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle	 but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this. Step by step the drama will be toned down	 and the battles will take the front row. Neither aspect is ever left completely out though. With the last episode in sight	 Noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind	 and with the last battle in sight	 certain questions are presented to the audience	 concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy	 and how far it can go to guarantee self-preservation. While they are never answered later on	 they still present some interesting food for thought. The last episode is very epic	 with a nice	 but quite predictable ending	 though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course. Again	 it fits the series.<br /><br />Gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first	 with alien invasions	 huge battles	 and some personal drama	 and for the bigger part	 it is. But it is done exceptionally well for a change. Instead of going for a steady mix of former elements	 six episodes long	 Gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism. Along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed-out characters	 which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon. The show is very tightly written	 although it does tend to slip up at some points. Overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided. Overall	 the trip Gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed	 sometimes sad	 sometimes heroic one. It might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre	 but at least it bend them a little. Highly enjoyable anime classic	 but not without flaws.<br /><br />***/*****"	1.0

"I couldn't agree more with another reviewer that mentioned Jodorowsky.<br /><br />Barney seems to be utterly boring and uninspired ""content-wise"". He can produce eye-candy (and I like candy)	 but its pretentiousness and fundamental artistic emptiness just diminishes all the joy. <br /><br />I am afraid that many people don't distinguish between similar (but really only on the surface) works of Jodorowsky or even more linear film-makers like Tarkovski or Kubrick (I love 2001 Odyssey and was never bored through the ending scenes...) That kind of art as M.Barney's makes adds confusion and fends off the viewers that could otherwise start to appreciate experimental cinema. Typical empty post-modern ""conceptual"" art. And check his interviews. I just don't buy it	 sorry. And so boring. <br /><br />I was never bored seeing Alejandro Jodorowsky's movies	 while Drawing Restraint 9 was an utter disappointment. Especially while it offered the possibilities to be something	 to actually tell something in a non-linear unorthodox way (like the beginning and the great choreographed dance and preparations for the ship to sail out. Ships ""meeting"" on the sea... Ideas of feces as an object of value(if it was feces). Those ""pearl"" divers... Everything could construct a great surreal movie with some content. But it didn't. ANd those horrible pretentious scenes of dressing up and fake tea ceremony... How vain and fake and philosophically pretentious but empty can it get?<br /><br />I has some great picturesque scenes	 but the whole movie became so boring and pretentious and utterly empty and fake that it made me physically sick.<br /><br />And it doesn't have good tempo. I like slow pace movies	 but this was just boring in some scenes - because it was pretentious and fake - so I was just forced to witnessed prolonged scenes of artistic vanity...<br /><br />That kind of movies just kill the art and spirit in my view. <br /><br />I want more Jodorowsky!!!"	0.0
"Bunny Comes Home 'This Man's Navy' deserves more credit than it gets	 a clever script by Borden Chase	 directed by 'Wild Bill' Wellman	 the film has just the right feel for early post WW11 euphoria and goodwill	 and none of the blind terror that came into play few years later. Produced in 1944	 the Japanese defeated	 the battle scenes a little déjà vu	 Tom Drake's melancholy attraction for radiant young Jan Clayton has solid chemistry	 plays real and validates Drake's career at Metro. The following year Jan opened on Broadway in 'Carousel.' Wally Beery	 a little bleary-eyed	 boasts to an always incredulous Jimmy Gleason his memories an improvement over reality	 and give Beery a Ulysses-like shadow to play against. The Navy LTA (Lighter Than Air) shots are authentic	 photographed at Tustin and Lakehurst	 and the P-38 squadron is out of March AFB. Lot 3 doubled for India	 and Bunny's U-turn Bunny Comes Home gives back to Beery an authentic slice of his past	 something he had wanted to believe was true then	 the future we spin into again is fantastical now on a grander scale	 a newly designed Navy LTA with launch capabilities for a reconnaissance plane how expensive	 blissfully optimistic still	 ""You got to believe in it	 that's the way you make things come true """	1.0
"Spend your time any other way	 even housework is better than this movie. The jokes aren't funny	 the fun rhymes that are Dr. Seus aren't there. A very lousy way to waste an evening. My kids 4-16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play Barbies and the older ones left to play ps2 and surf the net. My wife left and did dishes. So I finished it alone. It was the worst ""kids"" movie I have seen. If you want to watch a fun kids movie watch Shrek 2	 that movie is fun for kids and their parents. AVOID THIS MOVIE. It isn't funny	 isn't cute	 the cat's makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc label."	0.0
"I loved the idea of this film from the moment I first saw a trailer for it. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the kindly	 playful	 slightly mad genius was enough to get me to see the film. The added spice of Matthau as Einstein made it even better.<br /><br />The story is pure fantasy	 but a delightful one. An auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman	 who happens to be Einstein's niece. With the help of four Fairy Godfathers of Physics	 Ed embarks on a quest to win Catherine's heart. Throw a jealous fiancé (who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology) and Eisenhower into the mix	 and you have pure fun.<br /><br />The film is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and daffy performances. Walter Matthau play Einstein as a mischievous imp; cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins is wonderfully endearing as Ed and Meg Ryan plays a step above her normal rom-com level. Stephen fry is a joy as the ""RRRatman"" and Ryan's fiancé; who lacks a single romantic bone in his body.<br /><br />The film fell below most radars	 but is a delightful treasure that does not grow stale with repeated viewings. It features first-rate writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world."	1.0
"I already loved ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" when it was released and I'm still loving it now	 5 years later. Still lots of people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never really had received much love at the time it came out.<br /><br />Sure	 the movie is over-the-top and campy but that at the very same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch. All of the sets	 costumes and characters are done perfectly over-the-top in a fun way	 without ever becoming truly ridicules. It's a visually spectacular movie to watch. It's a campy movie making at its very best! Director Ron Howard really surprises with this fun little Christmas movie.<br /><br />Main reason why the movie works and why it's so much fun to watch is Jim Carrey as the Grinch. He truly carries the movie with his good and fun role. He is of course helped by the convincing make-up	 which also received an Academy Award. Of course if you're a Jim Carrey hater you shouldn't even think about watching this movie. This movie is really his movie and he makes it all work and so much fun to watch. Other fun and memorable roles are being played by Jeffrey Tambor	 Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as the young Grinch.<br /><br />The movie has a good morale but it is all a bit sappy to me. Perhaps it's because I'm Dutch and we don't really celebrate Christmas that enthusiastic and big here	 as in the United States or England. For me the movie was simply fun and entertaining and the morale just left me quite cold to be honest.<br /><br />The musical score by James Horner is good and fun	 even though it's your average every day Horner stuff	 it still all works perfectly for the movie and helps to make some of the scene's work.<br /><br />Perfect Christmas entertainment.<br /><br />8/10"	1.0

Please just do yourself a favor	 if you ever get the urge to watch this and watch thirty minutes of that annoying purple dinosaur Barney	 then multiply that thirty times fold and you would still only get a small fraction of the horror you would be in store for. In summation	 i guess you really can call it a horror movie	 but only if you're willing to be scared senseless by the worst acting in the business and utterly pointless story.<br /><br />Real Rating	 -10 Disgusting"	0.0
"Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to take a position as a secretary with the rich Hughes family to get over her boyfriend leaving her. Almost immediately she is drugged and shipped off to the family's estate in Cornwall. When she awakens they keep telling her she's Marion Hughes	 has been mentally ill and keep her locked up...but why? You'll probably guess why but won't mind because this one is fun.<br /><br />Along with ""The Narrow Margin"" and ""Face Behind the Mask"" this is one of the best B pictures ever made. (B pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars). It's just as long as it needs to be (only 65 minutes)	 is well-directed	 fast paced and exciting. It only stumbles at the end which I found a bit too implausible to buy.<br /><br />Foch (a good actress) is just OK in the lead but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is excellent (and frightening) as the villains. Well worth catching. A perfect example of how you can make a great movie on a small budget."	1.0

"Following a sitcom plot is so mindlessly easy that having her character simultaneously operate both within and without the context the rest of the cast inhabit is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could really use. The supporting characters ground the show in a sitcom reality which provides a contextual counterpoint to Sarah's erratic persona which	 beyond general insensitivity	 has no specific recurring traits for behavioural expectations to be based on	 making her less a character than a canvas to be repainted in every episode if not scene. Sarah's ability to see everything from an outside perspective enables her to parody aspects of social behaviour that are subtle enough to usually go unnoticed. Every time she speaks it's like a self-contained 5 second skit. She overemotes a lot	 demonstrating the countless things a smile or change in vocal pitch can signify	 but never sticks with one idea long enough for you to get comfortable and form expectations that will be satisfied. This may be the most creative	 original and experimental TV program ever."	1.0
"This rather formulaic swords and flying fists movie is a decent early display of John Woo's talents. The cinematography is excellent and some of the sword work is truly remarkable. Unfortunately the film labours under the burden of a dull story and a glaringly low budget (check some of the setbound fight scenes if you doubt me). Nonetheless	 it's worth seeing	 especially if you can catch in letterboxed."	0.0
"This movie masquerades as a social commentary	 when in fact it is every bit as ridiculous as the very racism it condemns. The premise of this movie: African-American = Strong... any other race = weak. The worst part is when Rapaport pulls a gun on Omar Epps and a Jewish guy. The Jewish guy	 in stereotypical fashion	 crumbles in fear and starts pleading for his life... but the big	 strong	 defiant Omar Epps stands strong with no fear. We also have the condemnation of every fraternity member as being a arrogant preppie drunk or rapist. The raped white girl	 of course	 begins considering lesbianism since she's just a weak white girl after all. When the nerdy white guy is rejected by the fraternity members he of course must fall in with the skinheads	 who are incredible cowards; especially the big muscular guy who is beaten down quickly by the strong black men. Wait... BUSTA RHYMES BEAT UP A GUY TWICE HIS SIZE??? Yeah	 right.<br /><br />Of course the black men NEVER reject their own people and Omar Epps moves in with them easily. The scenes where Ice Cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in line are just stupid -- of course he is the dominating one while his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and eventually move out. This movie was just terrible and the ending made me actually laugh out loud. The overly long slow-motion between Epps and Banks gets hilarious with the faces they make -- it's like watching my nephew and cousins making faces at each other (and they're all under 5). Do yourself a favor and skip this crapfest."	0.0
"""Fever Pitch"" isn't a bad film; it's a terrible film.<br /><br />Is it possible American movie audiences and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that Hollywood churns out that they'll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs? That's the only reason I can think of why this horrible romantic comedy (and I use that term loosely because there's nothing funny in this film) is getting good reviews.<br /><br />I sat through this film stunned that screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel would even for an instant think their script was funny.<br /><br />The brilliant Nick Hornby usually translates well to film. He adapted ""Fever Pitch"" for a British film starring Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell in 1997; Peter Hedges found Hornby's voice for ""About a Boy"" (2002) and when ""High Fidelity"" was Americanized for a movie in 2000	 writers D.V. DeVincentis	 Steve Pink	 John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg didn't go wrong because they kept the essence of Hornby's wit and humor. They made one of the best films of that year.<br /><br />So why does the American version of ""Fever Pitch"" go so painfully awry? The British version wasn't a masterpiece	 but it was charming	 funny	 unexpected and gave us two characters we could like	 respect and understand.<br /><br />But Ganz and Mandel have excised everything funny in Hornby's work. In Americanizing the story	 they've butchered it	 removing all that was good and unique about Hornby's work and replacing it with conventional drivel.<br /><br />They've transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy	 never once veering from the wretched formula. Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) has three girlfriends	 each of whom has a distinct function. One's overweight	 the second's cynical and ambitious	 and the third's a romantic. Want to guess how many male friends Ben (Jimmy Fallon) has?<br /><br />What made ""High Fidelity"" such fun was not only a good leading man and lady	 but engaging supporting characters. In this ""Fever Pitch	"" the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny. They're so insignificant	 they're not even decorative. The only reason they're in the film is because the formula demands it. Poor Ione Skye winds up as one Lindsey's pals in a thankless role. The lovely Skye must have been wishing Lloyd Dobler would swoop in and take her away. Come to think of it	 Cusack would've made an excellent Ben. Of course	 Cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious script.<br /><br />There isn't a single	 solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced. Every plot turn is predictable	 every lame joke telegraphed. Ganz and Mandel labor for laughs. The first 45 minutes are so excruciatingly slow	 you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy. You can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch. It's almost as if Ganz and Mandel penned this with some screen writing guru's formula pasted on the wall. When they got to a certain page	 they looked up at the formula and said	 ""OK	 the guru says this has to happen now."" And	 presto!<br /><br />Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly don't help the film any. They have no concept how to introduce their story and characters (they hand over the V.O. narration not to the protagonist	 but to another guy who sits behind Ben at Fenway Park). Thanks to some extremely clunky writing	 we have to watch Barrymore and Fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetings.<br /><br />Barrymore does cute and adorable better than most. She's as good at it as Goldie Hawn in her heyday. But even her cuteness can't save this extraordinarily awful film. She tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story. About 30 minutes into the film	 Lindsey tells Ben	 ""You're funny."" The only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script. For Fallon's Ben never says anything even remotely funny. Fallon is neither witty nor funny; when he does comedy	 he overacts.<br /><br />Fallon was never any good on ""Saturday Night Live."" He was quite possibly the least funny person on that show. Remember that lame sketch about a radio DJ who did all the voices? The only reason ""Weekend Update"" worked occasionally was because Fallon's cohort	 Tina Fey	 knows a thing or two about comedy.<br /><br />Actors who think they're funny and behave that way rarely	 if ever	 are actually funny. That's true of Fallon. He thinks he's hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle. His stuttering	 unsure-of-himself shtick didn't work on the small screen; it's lousier on the big screen.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Fallon	 his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments. If you thought his comedy was bad	 wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff. Two scenes in particular - the first in a park	 the second in front of Ben's school - are painful to watch. The scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability	 but Fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work. His range of emotions doesn't even run the gamut from A to B.<br /><br />Ben has no personality or depth. Often	 he comes across as an oaf. And not a lovable one at that. It boggles the mind what Lindsey would find attractive about him. Compare Fallon's performance to Firth's in the British version	 and you'll understand how terribly flat	 unfunny and forced Fallon's Ben is and how wrong he is for this role. Watching Fallon in ""Fever Pitch"" makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of Ashton Kutcher!<br /><br />Just as ""High Fidelity"" did	 an Americanized ""Fever Pitch"" could've worked brilliantly. It just needed better writers	 more competent directors and	 most definitely	 a stronger	 funnier	 smarter leading man.

"My wife and I like to rent really stupid horror/sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh. We saw this one on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now	 when I say this movie is awful	 I mean it in a good way. Everything about it	 the acting	 camera-work	 story	 costumes	 is just so cheezy and low budget but thats what makes it so good. I think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place. I really hope that whoever made this film wasn't serious when they made it because if they were	 then that would just be sad. If you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then I recommend this one."	0.0
"For a ""no budget"" movie this thing rocks. I don't know if America's gonna like it	 but we were laughing all the way through. Some really Funny Funny stuff. Really non-Hollywood.<br /><br />The Actors and Music rocked. The cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up. Whooo Whooo!<br /><br />I've seen some of the actors before	 but never in anything like this	 one or two of them I think I've seen in commercials or in something somewhere. Basically it Rocked! Luckily I got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors."	1.0
"This film reminds me of how college students used to protest against the Vietnam War. As if	 upon hearing some kids were doing without cheeseburgers in Cow Dung Collehe	 the President was going to immediately change all US foreign policy.<br /><br />The worst thing is that	 while dangerous	 the concept of a policy based on if the USSR and US went to war it could mean the end of the world	 WORKED. The US and USSR NEVER WENT TO WAR.<br /><br />Had we only conventional weapons	 the notion of yet another war	 a ""win-able"" war	 in Europe and Asia was not unthinkable.<br /><br />Not that I think they should get rid of this movie. It should be seen by film students as a splendid example of ""How NOT to make a film.""<br /><br />It should be 0 stars or maybe black holes..."	0.0
"Allow me to start this review by saying this: I love vampire movies. They can suck (har har pun intended)	 and I'll still love them because vampires are just cool in movies. Van Helsing	 considered by many to be a steaming pile of crap	 was enjoyable to me because of the fact that there were vampires. You may ask: ""What does that have to do with this movie?"" The answer is that I intend to inform you of how horrible this movie truly is	 that even a sucker (harharhar) for vampire movies like me can despise a movie like this so much.<br /><br />The movie stars Van Helsing	 a college professor guy who isn't at all convincing. He's a terrible actor	 like everyone else in this movie	 and he wrote it	 to add salt to the wound. I honestly to not mean to offend him	 and I'm sure everyone had fun making this movie	 but watching it was actually painful. I'm not sure why I watched the whole thing; perhaps it was a morbid fascination	 like watching an impending train crash: it's horrible	 but you can't manage to force yourself to look away. Its main fault is that it's just so ****ing boring	 and its plot is so damn ridiculous	 even for a science fiction horror movie.<br /><br />But	 I digress. By the way	 Van Helsing has sex with his mom. Of course	 he doesn't know it's her at the time; he just thinks it's one of his students (which is still illegal and all	 but not as disgusting and creepy).<br /><br />If I were Van Helsing	 I would at least pull an Oedipus myself when I found out I had done something so gross. It would've made for one entertaining thing if he just made some comment on it	 but no. The point isn't even brought up at all	 by any of the characters. It's as if the writer didn't even think of it. I would've at least had another character laugh at him and say ""Ha ha	 you had sex with your mom	"" which would be mildly humorous (although blatantly immature). I'm probably running out of room	 so a few more words to dissuade you from ever seeing this film: there's a vampire ninja fight with an old man. It would be funny	 but the filmmakers expect us to take it seriously. It's not even worth watching the movie to see how bad it is. Stay far	 far away from it if you value your time at all.<br /><br />I will say one thing positive about the movie: the guy who plays Van Helsing is pretty slick with that knife of his. There's like	 a minute long segment where he swings around his knife and actually does some pretty nifty tricks. It would be boring in any other movie	 but here	 sadly	 it was the highlight."	0.0
"If you went to this movie to see some huge academy award presentation...oh well..but if you wanted to see a funny delightful adaptation of an old classic	 you will love it..Jim Carey was incredible as usual. The story line was great	 a few parts added like the history of the Grinch made it even better. Ron Howard never misses a beat..But although there were a few ADULT comments and cleavage added	 this is supped to be a kids or family show. Try not to lose sight of that ..if you do you really wont enjoy the movie...and as for the comments about Ron Howard	 try to direct a major motion picture and see how you do..its not easy as it looks ..."	1.0
"This is good little shocker; not perfect by any stretch of the imagination	 but tight	 competent and disturbing. An excellent example of a simple idea developed into a compelling 90 minute script.<br /><br />The set up requires no bells and whistles	 no lengthy exposition or wordy back story; Kate (Franka Pontente)	 a young German business woman living in London	 drifts off whilst waiting for the last tube train. She awakens to find the place deserted	 but quickly comes to realise that she is far from alone. Someone	 or something	 is down there with her and it's intentions are wholly malicious.<br /><br />In fact she encounters several other characters in her quest to survive	 including a lecherous work colleague	 a homeless couple and a caged sewage worker	 all of whom add pace and substance to the plot. There is a slightly awkward gear change somewhere in the middle of the film when tension thriller mutates into gore fest	 but nothing so clumsy as to slow the hectic pace. For those of you with weak dispositions this is likely to be a harrowing ride; for those of you who relish a bit of well executed carnal mayhem this should press all the right buttons.<br /><br />The climax of the film is perhaps less successful than the main body of the film	 but it is punctuated with a nice moment of unexpected social commentary which provides a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />Some may find themselves feeling somewhat cheated of a clear explanation as to the exact nature and history of the threat encountered by Kate and her confederates	 however	 for me this was not the case. A horror film writer should not need feel compelled to dot every i and cross every t	 in the same way a writer of political thrillers might be expected to. There are enough clues here to give you a very pretty clear idea of what brought this evil into existence	 making a detailed and conclusive solution superfluous. The retention of a certain sense of mystery is to be welcomed and reminds us that in this film the ride was always going to be more important than the exact destination.<br /><br />My understanding is that the budget for this film was	 to say the least	 minimal	 in which case our applause for this British horror should be all the louder	 for at no point does one have the impression of corners being cut or effects failing to deliver.<br /><br />If this sounds like your kind of film then it probably is. Buy a ticket and climb aboard."	1.0
"I saw ""El Mar"" yesterday and thought it to be a great movie. It starts with a childhood episode in the life of the 3 main characters: Ramallo	 Manuel Tur	 and Francisca. After that we jump about 10 years to an hospital where the 3 friends meet again.<br /><br />Religion	 sickness	 love	 violence and sexuality rage throughout the movie creating and intense and tension-filled movie.<br /><br />I see people complaining about the film being too gory and i think they missed the point of the story. It's a violent	 intense and sad story. People are expected to suffer. To cry. To get hurt. To bleed. And i think that what the film shows	 isn't done for pure shock-value or presented in a distasteful way. I know that some people like their films ""clean""	 even those with violence in it. But sometimes	 a movie needs to make you feel unconfortable to work. This is one of those movies. And a great movie it is.<br /><br />The only fault i found was that there were 3 or 4 moments were some plot details weren't 100% clear	 and only after thinking about them at the end of the movie	 it all made sense. But it wasn't anything of much importance to the overall story	 so i still give this movie a 9."	1.0
"Hare Rama Hare Krishna was the biggest hit movie of 1971. Filmed almost entirely in Kathmandu	 the capital of Nepal	 the movie depicts not only with the theme of a broken family	 but also a relationship between a brother and a sister	 as well as drugs and the hippie movement	 which made many people think that it involved the ISKON - the movement for Krishna consciousness.<br /><br />The movie begins with scenes of drugs and being informed that the woman dancing in front is the narrator's sister. Going back to the past the brother and sister are happily playing around the house only to hear their parents arguing. This soon leads to a split in the family. The brother goes with the mother and the sister with the father.<br /><br />As years pass	 the brother goes in search of his sister and is informed that she no longer lives with the father and that she has moved to Nepal. Here	 Prashant	 the brother not only finds love	 but he also finds his sister	 Janice. But he finds out that she is not only in the wrong company of friends but is also on drugs as she wants to block all memory of her past. With help of Shanti	 his love	 the brother tries to get his sister away from all this but has to overcome many obstacles	 including people who stoop to all sorts of levels to stop him This is a multi cast movie and is led by the director and producer himself	 Dev Anand and also stars Zeenat Aman (her first movie)	 Mumtaz	 Rajendranath	 Prem Chopra	 Jnr Mehmood	 A.K. Hangal and Achala Sachdev. The music is superbly provided by the late R.D. Burman	 whose last score was ""1942 - A Love Story."" During the filming	 Dev Anand asked Panchamda (R.D. Burman) to compose something special for this film. Days later Panchamda came back with the composition of ""Dum Maro Dum."" The song was an instant hit."	1.0
"How can you gather this respectable cast of young British actors and come up with such a pile of filmic manure? Horrible script	 annoyingly hectic camera	 awfully edited	 gruesomely badly acted. Only Rhys Ifans tries to fill his role with life. Another painful proof that ""different"" sometimes equals ""dreck"". Why do the money people fail to read the scripts beforehand? Do yourself a favour: spare yourself and do something else - like hitting a mallet onto your knees. It's less painful and more fun than this movie!"	0.0
"Given the low budget and production limitations	 this movie is very good. It is plausible	 realistic	 and shows how the Csikos (Hungarian horsemen who lived on the plains (puszta) risked their lives to save a downed American pilot from the ruthless and savage Nazis. We are drawn into strong feelings for the young	 impressionable	 yet highly courageous boy--who admires the American pilot. If you're looking for special effects	 superman heroes	 and magical endings--this movie is not for you. If you want to feel what it must have been like to dodge the persistent	 amoral Nazis and their lack of compassion	 then you will be enthralled by this movie. I truly enjoyed it and for those who love horses	 dogs	 and humble	 helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to that end	 this movie will be one you'll remember for a long time."	1.0
"This trashy B movie attempts to masquerade as a study of sexual addiction	 but it is really a poor excuse for a sexploitation flick. The story revolves around Sammy Horn (subtle name) played by Michael Des Barres. Sammy is a restaurant owner with a clueless wife Grace (Rosanna Arquette) and a young child. He has a sexual addiction and must have meaningless sex every five minutes with any woman in his field of vision who will agree (and of course every woman on the planet finds him irresistible despite the fact that he looks old enough to be collecting Social Security).<br /><br />The story is centered on a conversation with his therapist (Nastassja Kinski) where he is describing each of his sexual exploits via flashback. This is nothing more than a convenient launching point for a parade of serial sex acts	 which consumes at least 75% of the screen time.<br /><br />It is hard to know where to begin criticizing a film this bad. The production values are abysmal. The movie is shot on video with a look somewhere between a TV soap opera (at best) and an amateur porn flick shot in someone's garage. The direction by Joseph Brutsman is horrible with bad lighting	 uninspired framing and poor actor direction. The script is vapid and the dialogue mindless and vulgar.<br /><br />Women are generally portrayed as sex obsessed nymphomaniacs just waiting for an addict like Sammy to come along and rough them up while feeding their insatiable appetites with some impersonal copulation. As an example	 Grace's sister comes over to indignantly inform Sammy that she knows he's been sleeping around and that she is going to tell his wife. His response to that is to throw her up against the wall and begin raping her. About three seconds into it she has an epiphany and is instantly converted to one of his sex disciples begging him to give her more. Just as they finish Grace walks in and sis says to her	 `Oh	 great to see you	 gotta run to pick up Timmy' and mum's the word about Sammy's indiscretions. The bond of loyalty has been sealed with a good ravishment. No spoiler here because it is so typical of the obvious nature of the film that anyone who had seen the first fifteen minutes could have predicted it.<br /><br />The sex depictions are all overdone	 mechanical	 and so poorly simulated that they are more comical than erotic. Most of them are done with both participants fully clothed. The acting is wretched. Michael Des Barres presents all the depth of a rain puddle. He really seems to get into the thrusting and profanity of the sex parts	 but when it comes to actually acting with Arquette and Kinski	 he is adrift. Rosanna Arquette is the closest thing to an actor in this film	 giving a bearable performance and looking genuinely hurt when she finally discovers that her perfect husband is a lecherous animal. Nastassja Kinski is far too compassionate as the therapist	 but at least we have some acting happening here. The rest of the cast is just a collection of elevated body doubles to whom they give thought provoking lines like `hit me harder	 is that the best you can do?' and `Oh	 God YES'.<br /><br />This movie is among the worst I have ever seen	 a dubious distinction given the thousands of films I have viewed. I have given it the extremely rare dishonor of rating it 1/10. Not to be seen within three hours of any meal."	0.0
"Wow	 i'm a huge Henry VIII/Tudor era fan and	 well	 this was .... interesting. The only one I watched was the Catherine of Aragon one. And wow...just wow. I've seen bad acting before	 but this reached new heights. When the actress who played Catherine was umm.. crying? she wails and screams and i have to admit i rewinded many times... many	 many times .... funny	 funny stuff. The only person who even showed any slight sliver of talent was the actress playing Anne Boleyn (i might be prejudiced though	 i do have a slight obsession with Anne Boleyn	 she was a really facinating woman	 read up on her	 it's worth it!) Also	 i have read a lot about the Tudor time period and i think that the characters weren't very acurately displayed	 they were all very stereotypical. Only see this movie if you are prepared to see a very important time period	 and the important lives of those involved turned into a laughing stock."	0.0

"The Sopranos is arguably the greatest show in Dramatic Television history.<br /><br />Its hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence	 sublime writing or first rate performances.<br /><br />Across its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality. Centering around the life of one Tony Soprano	 a man who lives in two families. One is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge New Jersey Mafia group	 of which he is the boss of both. Played by James Gandolfini	 of True Romance and The Mexican fame	 Tony is a fascinating	 scary but also likable guy. Full praise must be given to Gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man. Contemporay American drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as Tony.<br /><br />The cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will stick in your memory for ever.<br /><br />The true genius of this tale however	 is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series. Twenty minute long dream sequences	 powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence. Yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love	 honour and respect for family. The series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous.<br /><br />With TV now competitive and often poor The Sopranos stands tall above the rest as America's most original and compelling drama. Forget Family Redifined. This is Television Redifined."	1.0
"There's a group of Fox TV executives sitting around a boardroom table wondering what new show to commission. <br /><br />'How about aiming for something like 24 or The West Wing?' says one of them	 but they all agree it would be too expensive	 and cheap TV is less likely to harm the station if it flops. <br /><br />'Well	 how about getting together some great comedy writers and doing a quality sitcom?' offers another and is fired on the spot. 'Don't you know good writers cost lots of money!' the big chief barks. 'That's why we invented reality TV.'<br /><br />'We could do yet another crime drama...' suggests a man in a bland suit. 'I'm listening...' the boss replies	 suddenly interested. 'People like CSI	 so let's do another copy of that	' Blandman adds.<br /><br />'But there are already far too many CSI clones out there	 what can we do to make ours stand out?' a naive junior enquires and is sacked instantly. 'Stand out! If we do that people may be confused! Let's give them more of what they already like!' the big chief screams. <br /><br />'Let's just add more violence and make it really grisly	 we are Fox after all	' another suit suggests to a hearty reply of 'now you're getting it'	 from the big chief. 'We could make them the Deviant Crimes Unit	' he goes on to add	 clearly on a roll. <br /><br />'By Jove	 he's got it!' the big chief laughs	 'and the victims could be beautiful and vulnerable women who wear very little on screen.' 'Well that would certainly distract people from the average acting and poor scripts	' Blandman points out. <br /><br />'Then it's settled	 we just need a name	' the big chief announces. 'We could call it Sex Cops Violence?' <br /><br />'Too literal	 how about Killer Instinct it conveys violence	 but sounds a bit like Basic Instinct which had lots of sex.' <br /><br />'Puuurfect'	 the big chief replies and then they all slap each other on the back and go and cancel Arrested Development."	0.0
"This scared the hell out of me when i was a teenager. Now I find it more amusing than scary	 but with some pretty unsettling moments and with a kind of sleazy quality to it that I like. And	 come to think of it	 the plot is rather disgusting actually...but handled with some kind of taste. If there is a problem with this movie	 it is that there are HUGE gaps where nothing exciting or interesting happens. Also	 the ending goes on forever	 making a potentially tense climax seem silly after a while with Barbara Bach screaming and screaming. The ""monster""	 after it is exposed	 isn't very scary either unfortunately. The somewhat drab look of the movie also works against it	 making it appear as a TV-movie more than something made for theaters. But it is an example of films that are rarely made nowadays so I urge horror fans to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic..."	0.0
"""De vierde man"" (The Fourth Man	 1984) is considered one of the best European pycho thrillers of the eighties. This last work of Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his home country before he moved to Hollywood to become a big star with movies like ""Total Recall""	 ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Starship Troopers"" is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author (Jeroen Krabbe) going to the seaside for recovering. There he meets a mysterious femme fatale (Renee Soultendieck) and starts a fatal love affair with her. He becomes addicted to her with heart and soul and finds out that her three previous husbands all died with mysterious circumstances...<br /><br />""De vierde man"" is much influenced by the old Hollywood film noire and the psycho thrillers of Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Wells. It takes much time to create a dark and gripping atmosphere	 and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have the right impact to push the story straight forward. The suspense is sometimes nearly unbearable and sometimes reminds of the works of Italian cult director Dario Argento.<br /><br />The cast is also outstanding	 especially Krabbe's performance as mentally disturbed writer that opened the doors for his international film career (""The Living Daylights""	 ""The Fugitive""). If you get the occasion to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on TV	 video or DVD	 don't miss it!"	1.0
"I first saw the trailer for Frailty on Yahoo Movies way back in the day	 after hearing Stephen King praise it to high heaven. Not really a fan of either star	 I still wanted to see it because I'm a huge thriller fan.<br /><br />I was not disappointed. The acting was superb	 especially from the two young boys. Usually I loathe child actors	 but Young Adam and Young Fenton were excellent. Bill Paxton really did a good job of directing it too. It was beautifully shot.<br /><br />One must also note the plot twists. The three twists at the end hit hard and fast	 and I didn't see them coming. The final twist of the film	 coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed	 gives me chills to this day	 even though I've re-watched the film so many times.<br /><br />A true gem."	1.0
"Robert Altman's downbeat	 new-fangled western from Edmund Naughton's book ""McCabe"" was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following. Aside from a completely convincing boom-town scenario	 the characters here don't merit much interest	 and the picture looks (intentionally) brackish and unappealing. Bearded Warren Beatty plays a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; once the profits start coming in	 Beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action. Altman creates a solemn	 wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place	 but the action in this sorry little town is limited--most of the story being made up of vignettes--and Altman's pacing is deliberately slow. There's hardly a statement being made (just the opposite	 in fact) and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds. It's a self-defeating picture	 and yet	 in an Altman-quirky way	 it wears defeat proudly. ** from ****"	0.0
"Going for something far away from the deliberately gross stuff that he usually makes	 John Waters (happy birthday	 John!) made this parody of the celebrity/art world. Edward Furlong plays the title character	 a working-class teenager in Baltimore who loves to photograph things. When a New York agent (Lili Taylor) discovers his work	 she offers him his big break	 which he accepts. But once he hits it big	 he has to reconsider everything.<br /><br />Basically	 ""Pecker"" looks at how he loses his friends and his normal life once he becomes a celebrity. The sort of thing that we might expect	 sure	 but with Waters directing	 there's always a few things to shock us (you'll know them when you see them). I certainly recommend it. Also starring Christina Ricci	 Mink Stole and Patty Hearst."	1.0
"This film was slated to be a blockbuster film	 and it really is. This is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics. With that in mind	 the movie delivers	 perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy Iron Man	 but well enough. Outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects	 the film drops off of the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote.<br /><br />Many viewers	 myself included	 will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered	 but that only makes the film a poor adaptation	 not a poor film. This film is unsatisfactory for other reasons. The makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind. The characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to 4-scene cameos. The main characters of Wolverine	 Victor Creed (never called Sabertooth in the film) and Colonel Stryker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by Liev Schriber's performance. The rest of the characters are tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eye-candy. Wolverine's character is fully developed after 30-minutes	 as is Sabertooth	 though Victor does pull off some surprises late in the film.<br /><br />The ""final boss"" of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is. The filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular character.<br /><br />Very disappointing..."	0.0
"If you are a Crispin Glover fan	 you must see this. If you are a Sean Penn fan	 you must see this. If you are a movie fan in general	 you must see this. If you have no idea who Crispin Glover is and you have no idea who Sean Penn is	 this film will probably still have a lot of value	 but the more work you've previously seen by Crispin or Sean	 the better.<br /><br />This movie is so funny	 but it is also pure genius. There is nothing that I know of that resembles this film. It is its own genre. I doubt that anything like it will ever be made again. I cannot say anything more about exactly why without partially spoiling it	 and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job at doing that. <br /><br />In response to any of the reviewers here that gave it a bad review	 I ask that you view the film again. In reality	 there is no point at which this film could fairly be called ""boring."" This is possibly the funniest	 most entertaining	 and least boring film ever made. And it only gets better with age and repeated viewings. A timeless classic that	 unfortunately	 very few will be able to claim to have seen.<br /><br />Beaver Trilogy is the brilliant work of director Trent Harris	 also responsible for the amazing Rubin and Ed	 which Crispin Glover also stars in.<br /><br />Unfortunately	 copies of this film are rare and hard to find.

"I have not read the novel	 though I understand that this is somewhat different from it; the fact that I rather enjoyed this	 coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre	 leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book. Having not read a single word of Austen's writing	 I really can't compare this to any of her work. What I can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever	 witty	 and well-delivered	 as well as the biggest source of comedy in this. This made me laugh out loud a lot	 with perfect British and verbal material. Every acting performance is spot-on	 and Paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker. The characters are well-written	 credible and consistent. I did find a couple of them extremely irritating	 however	 and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be funny	 it tended to get repeated excessively	 and it honestly wasn't amusing the first time they appeared. The editing and cinematography are marvelous	 and everything looks utterly gorgeous. Plot and pacing are great	 you're never bored. It does end in a *really* obvious manner	 but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer. I can't claim that this did not entertain me	 it did from start to finish	 and I'd watch it again. There is brief language in this. I recommend this to any fan of romance stories. 7/10"	1.0
"Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only all dislike each other to the point of loathing	 but they have little to no redeeming qualities to make an *audience* like or empathize with any of the characters either. There are movies so bad they are good (a la Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter films)	 and there's just plain bad (like 99% of Uwe Boll's ""work""). This film is barely tolerable even if you are a brilliantly talented MSTie riffer (e.g.	 Mystery Science Theatre 3000). Thankfully while I am rather talented in that regard (it's how my mind works All The Time)	 for those who are not so naturally talented in MSTie riffing	 eventually into *this* film you'll just want to pull your own head off	 painfully aware the movie ""Taboo"" robs you of about an hour and twenty minutes you'll never get back. Even my MSTie talents were barely a match for this slow paced	 boring waste of time. The most puzzling aspect of this film is that *someone* green-lit and/or funded it... I rented ""Taboo"" solely for the normally talented Amber Benson	 who clearly must have been blackmailed into doing this film. I've another lesser known film of hers in my rental queue	 the reviews to which I'd better read first. Ironically the best aspect of the film was its impressive labyrinthine mansion for its interior location."	0.0
"How I got into it: When I started watching this series on Cartoon Network	I have to say that I've never seen anything like this	and it was the best. But when I started collecting the series on VHS	and years later on DVD part of Bandai's Anime Legends collections. It was amazing	and truly worth watching. It had a lot of exploding action that will blow you out of your seat. And of course	the theme songs ""Just Communication""	and Rhythm Emotions"" were the best.<br /><br />Characters	and Gundams: My favorite characters in the show were:Heero	Duo	Relena	Treize	Lady Und	Noin	and Zechs. My favorite Gundams in the show that I liked the most are the Wing Zero	and Epyon	and of course the Altron	and Deathscythe I	and II.<br /><br />Meaning of the show: What this series also tells us that in real life	wars are very hard and we can sometimes win	or lose. But peace can also be hard to obtain	and I do believe the Gundam pilots are doing the right thing	and are trying to obtain world peace.<br /><br />But however	this show is truly the best of the best. So in closing to this review	after you watch this show	see the Movie Endless Waltz."	1.0

I hope the director will go on stepping across the border	 as though i felt the choices Vincenzo Natali made	 were not always subtle (some of the scenes were unhappily kind of ""tarte-à-la-crème""	 like a childish slapstick)	 speaking about script and cinematography The color of ""Cube"" was black	 ""Nothing"" is white	 more cheerful	 surprisingly	 than the former films of Natali."	1.0
"As a cinema fan White Noise was an utter disappointment	 as a filmmaker the cinematography was pretty good	 nicely lit	 good camera work	 reasonable direction. But as a film it just seamed as predictable as all the other 'so called' horror movies that the market has recently been flooded with. Although it did have a little bit of the 'chill factor' the whole concept of the E.V.O (Electronic Voice Phenomena) did'not seem believable. This movie did not explain the reasonings for certain occurrences but went ahead with them. The acting was far from mind blowing the main character portrayed no emotion	 like many recent thriller/horror movies.<br /><br />Definitely not a movie I will be buying on DVD and would not recommend anyone rushes out to see it."	0.0
"And I'll tell you why: whoever decided to edit this movie to make it suitable for television was very ill-advised. EVERYTHING CONCERNING DRUGS IS CUT OUT AND COVERED UP!!! How do they do it	 you might ask? Well	 they don't do it very well	 that's for sure. Anyway	 instead of the marijuana which Cheech and Chong are supposed to have in their possession	 they are said to have diamonds! Still	 the characters go around in a haze of marijuana smoke stoning others along their way with no explanation whatsoever!"	1.0
"This is a story of the Winchester Rifle Model 1873 ""The Gun That Won The West"" To cowman	 outlaw	 peace officer or soldier	 the Winchester 73 was a treasured possession. An Indian would sell his soul to own one...<br /><br />Winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart	 a duo that would go on to create a run of superior Westerns that added a new	 psychological depth to the genre. The story sees Stewart as Lin McAdam pursuing the man who killed his father. Riding into Dodge City with his trusty friend	 Johnny Williams {Millard Mitchell}	 Lin runs into Dutch Henry Brown {Stephen McNally}	 the man he wants. But with Wyatt Earp {Will Geer} having taken all the guns from those entering the town	 both men are unable to have the shoot-out that they are ready for. The men instead square up in a competition to win a Winchester 73 rifle	 a competition that Lin eventually wins. But before he can leave town with the magnificent prize	 Dutch ambushes him	 steals the rifle and skips town fast. As Lin sets off in hate filled pursuit of both man and rifle	 the rifle will changed hands a number of times	 with each time adding another dimension as the day of reckoning for all approaches.<br /><br />Very much a benchmark for what became known as the so-called ""psychological Western""	 Winchester 73 is basically a story of a decent man driven to borderline insanity by an event in his past. Tho shot in black and white {the only one of the duos Westerns that was} the landscapes are still breathtaking feasts for the eyes. The tone is set with the opening scene as Lin and Johnny on horseback	 and in silhouette	 amble over a hillside as they make their way to Dodge City. It's just the starting point that would see Mann use his vistas as a way of running concurrent with his characters emotional states.<br /><br />Stewart gives one of his finest and most intense performances as McAdam	 proving once and for all that he was one of Americas finest and most versatile actors. The support cast isn't too bad either. Shelley Winters is excellent as the sole female in amongst the machismo	 while Mitchell	 McNally	 Geer and the always great Dan Duryea add further class to proceedings. There's even bit parts for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson in here	 tho the latter playing an Indian brave is a stretch too far.<br /><br />Originally the film was a project for Fritz Lang	 who even had the script ready to run. But Lang walked away from it	 something that proved to be a blessing for Western fans. For as great as a director that Lang was	 with Mann directing {and with a new script from Borden Chase & Robert Richards in hands} it set the wheels in motion to alter the course of the genre. Not only with the further efforts that Mann & Stewart produced	 but also in who they influenced. The likes of Budd Boetticher	 Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller were all taking notes	 and gleefully for the Western purists	 they followed suit and carried the psychological torch still further.<br /><br />A big hit at the box office back on release	 Winchester 73 is a magnificent film that still packs a punch in the modern age. 9.5/10"	1.0
"When a movie like ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" brings in over $75 million it makes some incredibly sad statements about the condition of our own society. Either we are collectively too stupid to stay away from trash like this or maybe I'm just not realizing how many people this kind of no-effort trash will appeal to.<br /><br />Hollywood has had no incentive to make good movies since if it puts out trash then people will see it anyways since there is nothing else on screen. This is that. I walked out despite getting a free movie pass. The dialogue could not be dumber. The stunts could not be more over-the-top and outrageous. Perhaps this ""bigger that big"" image appeals to Texans but it didn't appeal to me nor anyone else in the theater. None of the ""big names"" were in this career-ending flick	 except for Burt Reynolds	 which says all you need to hear. Jessica Simpson -- don't make me laugh.<br /><br />I wouldn't even recommend this film for video	 even if you were desperate. This was all about fooling the public to make enough money after opening day to equal or do better than it cost through marketing. They did despite the public being forewarned. Stupidity abound."	0.0
"I am a huge fan of Simon Pegg and have watched plenty of his movies until now and none of them have ceased to make me laugh. Neither did How to lose friends and Alienate People.<br /><br />This movie is essentially about a man good as pissing people off. However	 he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing things that might just make him famous. But in the end he ends up doing them	 the culture of life.<br /><br />The movie is well toned with humor	 romance	 good acting and also a bit of a lap dance. Its one of those movies where you could just be happy when it ends."	1.0
"Wracked with guilt after a lot of things felt apart on that ledge	 an ace mountain rescue climber Gabriel Walker (Stallone) comes back for his girlfriend Jessie (Janine Turner)	 while over the cloudy skies where the weather looks a bit threatening	 a spectacularly precarious mid-air hijacking goes wrong and $100 million taken from a Treasury Department plane get lost in the middle of nowhere followed by a crash landing <br /><br />Stranded off the snowy peaks	 and needing mountain guides to win back the stolen cash	 the high-trained hikers make an emergency call asking the help of a rescue unit <br /><br />Unfortunately	 Gab and Hall (Michael Rooker) have to team up to arrive at the scene of the crash unaware that the distress call was a fake	 and a bunch of merciless terrorists led by a psychotic (John Lithgow)	are waiting for them only to find out a way off the stormy mountain with the dumped cases of money <br /><br />With breathtaking shots	 vertiginous scenery	 dizzying heights	 perilous climbs	 freezing temperatures	 ""Cliffhanger"" is definitely Stallone's best action adventure movie"	1.0
"Okay	 let's not get confused here. If this is a sequel to a remake of an original horror classic	 does that mean it also automatically is a remake of the original horror classic's sequel? Here's to hoping that's not a general rule	 as Wes Craven's own sequel to the original ""The Hills have Eyes""  released somewhere during the mid-80's  is easily one of the worst and absolute most redundant horror movies ever made. Part two didn't have an actual plot and re-used footage of the original only to further exploit the success of the genuinely gritty and petrifying premise. Craven also wanted us to believe even dogs suffer from flashbacks and painful memories	 as the loyal German Shepard of the Carter family re-experienced his bloody fight with one of the mountain hillbillies. There were quite a bit of alarming signs indicating us that this sequel would be a horrendous failure as well. The remake came out barely one year ago and here's the sequel already? The incredible speed of its release righteously causes you to question the quality of the script. Don't they need a little more time if they want to come up with a film that should be scary	 menacing and disturbing? With his excellent film	 Alexandre Aja nearly single-handedly altered the general opinion about horror remakes	 as he had the courage and intellect of changing essential elements in the plot and adding more nauseating gore than anyone could ever had hoped for. Also	 Aja is quite a talented young director and made himself noticed with his French instant cult classic ""High Tension""	 but who is this new director? Aja's ""The Hills Have Eyes"" was an unexpected hit	 appreciated by both experienced and older generations of horror fans as well as the younger and over-enthusiast target groups. It's a really good film and	 even though an avalanche of new sequels and clones will be inevitable	 it's highly unlikely that one of them will ever equal the surprising quality level of Aja's smashing hit. Bearing all this in mind	 plus a rather large dose of personal skepticism	 I must admit this rushed sequel really isn't as awful as anticipated. The screenplay is routine and clichéd horror fodder	 introducing a fairly large number of characters with few or even no backbone and tastelessly depicting how they get slaughtered by traditionally repulsive-looking freaks. After the events of the first film	 the US army has set up a camp in the middle of the New Mexican desert to investigate the effects of the nuclear tests	 which took place there in the 50's and 60's. For the horribly mutated survivors of the miner's community that stayed there during the radioactive testing	 the scientists and researchers form a tasty starter until the main course of incompetent soldiers arrives by truck. They are just supposed to drop off food and supplies but encounter their ultimate military training exercise when faced with the relentless humanoids that live inside the remainders of the mines.<br /><br />This basically is just another by-the-numbers slasher with dumb characters who are	 even after losing several of their friends already	 still stupid enough to separate themselves from the group and act like easy targets to kill. It's also very easy to point out which ones will make it out of this adventure alive	 especially when one of the soldiers is against all types of violence and another one continuously stares at video images of her cute 3-year-old son. ""The Hills Have Eyes II"" completely lacks  as to be expected  originality	 logic and plausible situations. The mutated miners aren't nearly as menacing as their colleagues in part one	 mainly because they aren't organized this time and only just behave like drooling and sex-hungry prototype monsters. Since you don't care for the amateur G.I. Joe ""heroes"" and definitely don't feel any sympathy for the eyes in the hills	 this film is a whole lot less compelling and involving than last year's original. Most peculiarly	 this second film isn't nearly as violent and gory as the first! Sequels usually compensate the lack of suspense and the absence of surprise-twists with extra bloodshed and more graphic killing sequences	 but the action in this sequel is really tame compared to the sick footage featuring in its predecessor. There are a handful of scenes to satisfy the bloodthirsty horror fanatics  mainly showing soldiers falling down cliffs or getting shot by their own guns  but there sadly aren't any outrageous pick-axe battles or virulent dog attacks. What a shame! What's the point of a sequel if it even fails to surpass the level of grossness and/or gratuitous filth of the original? Luckily enough the film is never boring or unnecessarily sentimental	 and you'll have the most fun spotting all the things that don't make the slightest bit of sense! For example	 wallets falling out of people's bloodied heads	 women without any muscle power cast as tough-ass soldiers and  my personal favorite  assigning the ONE soldier with a speaking disability to operate the radio communications."	0.0
"About 4 years ago	 I liked this movie. I would watch it over and over and over. But now... I don't. Actually	 I think this movie would have been great for Mystery Science Theater 3000. It has a bunch of comment-heavy actors (Macaulay Culkin	 Christopher Lloyd	 Patrick Stewart	 Whoopi Goldberg)	 and a pretty cheesy plot. My favorite part is when Culkin is riding his bike and he comes across a gang and a gang member says	 ""Hey	 Tyler! Where ya goin'? The MOON??"" Also look out for the classic line	 ""Do you have feeling in your toes?""<br /><br />On the other hand	 it's better than ""The Good Son""."	0.0
"I would reccomend this film to everyone. Not only to the fans of the rocker Luciano Ligabue	 but to all film-buffs. Because it's sincere	 moving	 funny and true. Because Ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover	 and every frame of his film is made with love and care. Because his characters are loved and ask to be loved. Because most of the Italian debut films are lousy and this one	 done by an outsider	 is a real joy to watch and to listen at. Because Stefano Accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza	 who was	 like Freccia	 beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin	 that Ligabue shows as it is	 unglamorous and ugly	 without indulging in easy moralisms. Because it's a film that speaks to our heart	 our ears	 our souls. And because I lived the experience of the FM radios and it was exactly like that. Thanks	 Luciano!"	1.0
"That's what my friend Brian said about this movie after about an hour of it. He wasn't able to keep from dozing off. I had been ranting about how execrable it was and finally I relented and played it	 having run out of adjectives for ""boring"". <br /><br />Imagine if you will	 the pinnacle of hack-work. Something so uninspired	 so impossibly dreadful	 that all you want to do after viewing it is sit alone in the dark and not speak to anybody. Some people labor under the illusion that this movie is watchable. It is not	 not under any form of narcotic or brain damage. I would ONLY recommend this to someone in order to help them understand how truly unbearable it is. Don't believe me? Gather 'round. <br /><br />Granted	 as a nation	 we in America don't always portray Middle Eastern peoples in a tasteful manner. But how about a kid in a sheik outfit bowing in salaam-fashion to a stack of Castrol motor oil bottles? You'll find that here. GET IT? THE ARAB WORSHIPS OIL. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Having the kid fly planes into a skyscraper would've been more appropriate. Who in their right mind would think that was a funny joke? It's not even close to ""cleverly offensive"". It just sucks and makes you want to punch whomever got paid to write that bit in the face. <br /><br />In the middle of the film	 a five-man singing group called the ""Landmines"" takes the stage at an officers' ball. Okay- are you ready? The joke is THEY SING TERRIBLY AND OFF-KEY. Why did I write that in caps also? Because the joke is POUND	 POUND	 POUNDED INTO YOUR HEAD with a marathon of HORRENDOUS sight gags. They start off mediocre enough; glasses cracking	 punch tumblers shattering... then there is	 I am 100% serious	 a two-frame stop-motion sequence of A WOMAN'S SHOES COMING OFF. You read that correctly- the music was so bad	 in one frame	 the woman's feet have shoes on. In the very next- the shoes are off!!! Get it	 because the music was so bad	 her shoes came off! What the F???? <br /><br />Then there is an endless montage of stock footage to drive home the point that the SINGING IS BAD. If any human being actually suffered through this scene in the theater without running like hell	 I would be astonished. This movie is honestly like a practical joke to see how fast people would bolt out the doors. Robert Downey Sr. directs comedy the way his son commands respect by staying drug-free. Badly. Other things to watch out for:<br /><br />1. The popular music shoehorned in wherever possible. Every time Liceman appears	 a really inappropriate Iggy Pop song plays. Plus all the actors do their best to act like it got really chilly for some reason.<br /><br />2. Barbara Bach's criminally awful accent. She sounds like she's trying to talk like a baby while rolling a marble around on her tongue. There is no nudity	 and there are several scenes where the boys all moan and writhe from a glimpse of her cleavage	 like they're in a community school acting class and they've been directed to act like aroused retarded people. <br /><br />3. Liceman feeds his revolting dog a condom. Remember; when this movie came out throwing in ""abortion"" and ""condom"" was seen as ""edgy"". <br /><br />4. Tom Poston plays a mincing	 boy-hungry pedophile	 back when Hollywood thought ""pedophile"" and ""homosexual"" were one in the same. Flat-out embarrassing. <br /><br />5. Watch the ending. Nothing is wrong with your VCR. That is actually the ending. Tell me that doesn't make you want to explode everyone who's ever made any movie	 ever. <br /><br />Watch this at your own risk. Up The Academy has been known to actually make other movies	 like The Jerk or Blazing Saddles	 less funny simply by placing the videotape near them."	0.0
"An overblown melodrama typical of its period (mid-1950s) and appropriate matinée food. Rock Hudson	 the hulk everyone always falls in love with	 plays his usual stereotype role	 but whereas in Giant	 made the same year	 when his material and co-stars (Taylor & Dean) were above average	 in this movie he is just not good enough to raise the calibre beyond a mushy tale of how difficult it is to be both rich and happy. The self-destructive brother and sister (Robert Stack	 reeling his way through the film in a drunken stupor	 and Dorothy Malone	 playing a vampish poor little rich girl totally over the top) end up the losers and Hudson gets Bacall - who is rather wooden in this part which does not have enough character or wit to get her going. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde	 the good end happily and the bad unhappily	 that is the meaning of fiction. However	 I was interested to read that the film is based on a true story which vindicated the plot. Like other films of the period	 homosexuality is disguised in heterosexual terms. Maybe the film could be remade: Stack's character would ring truer if he was hiding homosexual feelings for Mitch by marrying. Todd Haynes's Far From Heaven greatly improved on All That Heaven Allows 	 also directed by Sirk. Perhaps Haynes could remake Written on the Wind and give us a truly memorable film."	1.0
"somewhere i'd read that this film is supposed to be a comedy. after seeing it	 i'd call it anything but. the point of this movie eludes me. the dialogue is all extremely superficial and absurd	 many of the sets seemed to be afterthoughts	 and despite all the nudity and implied sexual content	 there's nothing erotic about this film...all leaving me to wonder just what the heck this thing is about! the title premise could have been the basis for a fun (if politically incorrect) comedy. instead	 we're treated to cheap	 amateurish	 unfinished sketches and depravity and weirdness for its own sake. if i want that	 i'll go buy a grace jones cd."	0.0
This is the first non-zombie subgenre review ive done but this movie is worth doing a review for. Dinocroc is a good movie in general but unfortunately it is still an obvious b-movie. The Dinocroc itself looked great but i thought the movie itself needed a little bit more weight as in action and violence because whenever the croc is shown or is in a fight scene not very much goes on except the croc is shown and the croc either kills or runs off in a repeated process. Jane Longenecker was hot which is a plus and the acting was better than average and the most surprising thing is that the croc looked fleshy instead of like a cartoon coughs* curse of the komodo*coughs. I enjoyed this movie enough to be glad that there is going to be a sequel which is more than what i can say about some movies in general. Overall 3/6 stars and worth a watch.	0.0
"Elizabeth Ward Gracen	 who will probably only be remembered as one of Bill Clinton's ""bimbo eruptions"" (they have pills for that now!) is probably the weakest element of this show. It really continues the tired formula of the Highlander Series- The hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met	 but there is some conflict	 and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequence.<br /><br />Then you have the character of Nick Wolf. Basically	 your typical unshaven 90's hero	 with the typical ""Sexual tension"" storyline. (Seriously	 why do you Hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) This was a joint Canadian/French production	 so half the series takes place in Vancouver imitating New York	 and the other half is in Paris... Just like Highlander did."	0.0
"After reading the other reviews for this film I am of the opinion that the high markers are probably paid studio lackeys as the film I saw was absolutely dire	 with wooden acting	 lacklustre scripting and plodding predictable directing	 one of the few plus points has to be the stunning scenery as this film features some stunning backdrops with great sweeping vistas and dramatic skies and wide open prairies	 sadly when the most memorable thing in a film is the part featured behind the actors this has to be a warning sign as to the quality of the movie	 all in all a thoroughly uninspiring addition to the western genre which even at the very reasonable price it can be obtained on DVD is best to avoid."	0.0
"This is a review of 'Freddy Mercury The Untold Story	' theatrical release	 Chicago Int. Film Festival	 2007 One of the phoniest	 uninspired and most tedious biographical documentaries I have seen. If the film I saw in a movie theater was originally released on TV	 I would plead with its producers and distributors to not fool a paying audience with the false promise of a cinematically worthy documentary feature. Even as a made-for-TV documentary	 the sentimental piano solos accompanying interviewees sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and the pompous	 pseudo-literary narration rang more true of a sleepapedic bed Infomercial. The only redeeming aspects of this ""The Untold Story of Freddy Mercury"" -- or	 uhm	 was it ""The Untold Story of Princess Diana"" are the original concert	 video and TV footage -- unabridged Freddy Mercury and Queen. Testimonial interviews with irrelevant eye witnesses with insights	 such as: ""He was a free spirit	"" (really.. I thought Freddy Mercury was a company man...) belittle those Freddy testimonials	 by Brian May or Montserrat Caballe that shed new and affectionate light into Mercury's complex life and character. And... what up with the Harry Potter-like boarding school segments? How did the interview with the first girl-crush (""...who now works in a travel agency"") and members of Freddy's first school band contribute to what I really want to know about Mercury? Vital milestones of his personal life	 his sexuality	 his artistic style and growth	 Queen	 the band remain unexplored. These filmmakers don't ask a single	 provocative question	 nor do they engage in independent or visionary research of their subject	 instead delivering a tedious montage of politely clean and vastly empty comments about an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend	 who doesn't deserve to be remembered by this History Channel biography your grandparents can doze off to on a Sunday night."	0.0
"Rosie wasted a lot of TV time talking about the Tainos as if they were super influential in the dynamics of the modern day Puerto Rican. They were not. The truth is that the Africans and the Spanish were and she knows it. What kills me is that she is standing on the screen looking like some average light skin black chick ( with an obvious black daddy	 cousins and auntie)pretending to truly acknowledge the real essence of what makes them the modern day Puerto Ricans	but barely mentioned how Africans influenced the way their Spanish is spoken	 the food and music. She is so typical and I lost a lot of respect for her and will not support anything else she does. Also	 since she wants to dance around her African-ness then she need not take more roles associated with blackness (i.e. Lackawanna Blues). We can find a prideful Black Latina next time (thank you Zoe Saldana	Gina Torres	 Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa).<br /><br />To the Puerto Rican on here that said they are African and not ""black""....thank you. We ""blacks"" certainly do not have anything in common with ""you"" so there is no love lost. But	 since you are probably in the States and have benefited from the Civil Rights movement we would like for you refuse any decent human treatment you received courtesy of the blood 	sweat and tears from the backs of the ""blacks"" you share nothing with.<br /><br />If I am correct Puerto Ricans have a terrible image in the media	 but we blacks do not spend our time trying to disrespect you because we know that the media loves to exploits the low points and behaviors of all minorities to maintain mindless generalizations. However	 you evidently have fed into the hype that one you are somehow white or superior...you are not. Also	 you somehow feel compelled to believe that black culture is BET...again you are incorrect and need to take a vacation out of the hood. Try visiting Atlanta	 Ga.	 Houston	 Texas	 Charlotte	 N.C.

"Moron and girlfriend conduct some ritual to resurrect the dead	 in attempt to prove that the dead can not be brought back to life. Not surprisingly	 they do resurrect a dead soul who commences chopping them up with an axe	 and the next day some college aged people are telling the story around a campfire. The guy with the axe turns up and starts hacking up the idiots telling the story. The group calls the cops	 the cop sees blood splattered all over and thinks it's a mountain lion(!?) and soon after is axed by some deformed killer who may or may not be a ghost.<br /><br />Moronic little splatter movie which was filmed in broad daylight but where several characters are carrying flashlights and talking as though it were the middle of the night	 and wanting to send up a signal flare to attract attention. One guy has a gun in one hand and bullets in the other but doesn't bother to load it	 then after he finally loads it	 he has several opportunities to shoot the killer but doesn't bother to	 because that would end the movie too early. Then he throws the gun away! Also detrimental is characters who show no emotion and don't look the least bit concerned after their friends are chopped up into pieces and lousy effects (the human heart looks like a piece of chicken meat	 the car blown up at the end clearly was a model car) and awful dialogue and some really ugly female nudity doesn't help. And in the end it tries to get away with it's incoherence by saying that it was all the invention of the same college aged people telling campfire stories at the start of this movie. <br /><br />Then the killer turns up for real in the last scene hacks them into pieces. Again.<br /><br />Mediocre of it's kind	 good only for some unintended laughs.<br /><br />*1/2 out of ****"	0.0
"""Freddy's Dead"" did the smartest thing it could've done after the disappointment of the fifth film. It started from scratch. Sure	 this ""final"" film in the saga is silly but at least it's original. Some of the visuals are even a bit breath-taking. And the story of Freddy's kid (Lisa Zane) returning to town to face her evil father is unique.<br /><br />Overall	 the movie is nothing but another cartoon made to get kids in the theater. It has a bunch of good actors (Zane	 Yaphet Kotto	 and Lezlie Deane) who basically look dumb and wander around like sheep ready for slaughter. It's one-sided	 it's a magic-trick	 and	 in the end	 it's nothing but goofy	 childish entertainment.<br /><br />"	0.0
"I first saw this film when it was transmitted around 1988 by the BBC when I was working on UK's 2000AD. My pal Steve Parkhouse recorded it on VHS and sent it to me. Up till this point	 I'd really only seen the Shaw Bros kung fu movies	 with their harsh lighting (so audience could see the moves clearly)	 so it was a revelation to me to see something that looked like it had been lit by Ridley Scott coming out of Hong Kong. This was also my first exposure to the movies of Tsui Hark (pronounced	 apparently	 ""Choy Huk"").<br /><br />Yet for all the smoky	 back-lit exteriors and ambitious special effects (Stop-motion? In a Hong Kong Movie?) at the heart of Chinese GHOST STORY lies a simple and moving love story	 made all the more real by the outstanding acting talent of Leslie Cheung (what a tragic	 tragic waste of a life!) and the beauty and elegance of Joey Wong. Granted Joey is gorgeous	 but it's her balletic hand gestures that give her character an unattainable eroticism that's hard to analyse. And though Joey is now almost 20 years older (gawd	 which of us isn't?) this will always be the enduring image of that actress.<br /><br />Some reviewers here have said that the film is simplistic and lacks any surprises	 but they're missing the fact that this movie was based on a famous Chinese story written by Pu Songling around 1700! That's a bit like complaining that Romeo and Juliet has a predictable ending and just copies WEST SIDE STORY. (Just wanted to get that off my chest!)<br /><br />For me	 Chinese GHOST STORY is the quintessential romantic tale. It has high tragedy	 because we know that Chio Sin and Sin Seen can never be together. It's about becoming mature	 for none of us can mature until we've experienced great loss. It's about sacrifice	 for sacrifice is an essential component of True Love. And the comedy stylings of Wu Ma don't hurt a bit	 either.<br /><br />Enjoy Chinese GHOST STORY by trying not to view it through a filter of Western culture and you'll get on with it just fine."	1.0
"just saw this exquisite 1982 movie Return of the Soldier	 based on Rebecca West's novel. Its about a shell-shocked fortyish Captain who doesn't even tell his wife he has returned to British soil	 but remains in a hospital in London. He's lost his memory and is a boy again	 with a lingering yen for the lower class sweetheart he pursued 25 years earlier. Its a delicate story. He is lingering in his boyhood	 while the reader discovers his wife is an unbearable	 aspiring socialite who wants him to resume his place in society. Living with them is his cousin Jenny	 who loved Chris Baldry the soldier	 when they were growing up as playmates	 but has settled into spinsterhood. The lower class woman	 played by Glenda Jackson	 is Margaret Gray. It is SHE who is notified that Chris is back in England. Chris' wife Kitty is shocked when Mrs. Gray comes to tell her that Chris is in a hospital in London. Kitty (Julie Christie) is vacuous and snobbish. Why	 she asks herself	 was this other woman sent a telegraph about Chris rather than her? Chris has forgotten totally about Kitty. He wants to renew his relationship with Margaret. The now married Margaret is reluctant to meet him	 but then does and continues to meet with him. There is a psychiatrist (Ian Holm) who warns Kitty and Jenny that Chris' temporary happiness with Margaret will disappear if he 'cures' him. Jenny realizes how empty Kitty is for Chris and forms a secret loving alliance through Margaret. They both are in love with him. Jenny wants to help. Late in the film Kitty reveals that Chris and she had a boy who died five years ago. Telling Chris this	 weighs the Shrink	 will certainly restore him to 'normal.' But is this a good idea? Chris	 barely aware that he and Kitty were ever married	 is unaware of his child and the child's death. The psychiatrist	 just learning of the child	 believes such knowledge will restore Chris. Jenny and Margaret have Chris all to themselves because Kitty believes he is faking and refuses to accept Chris's illness in reverting to his youth in his forties. The film leaves her mostly out of consideration concerning whats to be done with Chris.<br /><br />But Jenny and Margaret	 in the child's perfectly maintained bedroom- with Kitty too in the novel	 but not in the screenplay- discuss what they believe should be done about Chris from their separate perspectives. Margaret is the critical one here	 because	 though married	 she has half fallen in love with Chris again. Jenny's social stature	 Jenny believes	 will be threatened if Chris does not right himself. She does not reveal this to Margaret	 however. Margaret decides	 looking ahead	 that Chris cannot maintain his fantasy over time	 but must return to something like a real life. While Kitty and Jenny look on from the window of the house	 Margaret approaches Chris outside and tells him of his lost son. The buoyant war victim's head sinks	 his shoulders slump	 he looks away. He walks dejectedly toward the house. Fin<br /><br />I read some criticism of this first novel of Rebecca West. The novel was written something after the first war. The movie is never quite clear who Jenny is	 his cousin or his sister. It would be more rousing if she were his sister	 of course. The criticism doesn't make it clear either. I'm sure West in her novel	 makes sure Jenny is her cousin	 not her sister. West is no Henry Miller nor an Anais Nin	 whose book Incest (about her relationship with her father as an adult to get even with him for molesting her as a child) I considered reading	 but then decided against. Rebecca the author has a need to restore Chris too. She too has outposts in her head for the Society her novel excoriates first but finally embraces once more."	1.0
"This movie was like a bad indie with A-list talent. The plot was silly	 all the way to the end. It reminded me very much of something churned out for the home video market in the 1980's. I would have given it a one	 but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worthwhile. I think the worst thing was the underwater scene's held off of the dock. The underwater lighting seemed to come from no were	 and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air	 this air tank would kind of appear.

After seeing a scene where the man forces another man for sexual reasons to Star in a Movie. I felt like spitting and breaking the DVD. Coincidently i did. The reason why was the movie contains scenes of child pornography and molestation. I literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children. Very disturbing stuff	 there was no need to show the children fully naked. One of the rich guys likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreign people	 British men in this movie. I am shocked to know this film was a Hit in parts of India	 otherwise Super Flop in UK	 USA and Australia. I'm from UK	 and this kind of stuff makes me sick	 shouldn't of been released in UK."	0.0
"Canadians are too polite to boo but the audience at the Toronto Film Festival left the theater muttering that they would rate this film 0 or 1 on their voting sheets. The premise is that a modern filmmaker is interpreting a 17th century fable about the loves of shepherds and shepherdesses set in the distant past when Druids were the spiritual leaders. Working in three epochs presents many opportunities to introduce anachronisms including silly and impractical clothing and peculiar spiritual rites that involve really bad poetry. Lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiotic codes of conduct from which cross-dressing and assorted farcical situations arise. The film could have been hilarious as a Monty Python piece	 which it too closely resembles	 but Rohmer's effort falls very flat. The audience laughed at the sight jokes but otherwise bemoaned the slow pace. The ending comes all in a rush and is truly awful. This is a trivial film and a waste of your movie going time."	0.0
"I suppose JEDI is now chronologically to be considered the very ""last"" entry in the popular saga	 and it's a very good one	 as were several of these. I liked how directly this sequel took off after THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK	 and I appreciated the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character(and also Mark Hamill	 as an actor). After hearing so many negative things about the Ewoks	 they weren't so bad. I enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods	 and I felt there was a lot of well-realized emotion with this chapter. The ending (with some new additions	 I presume?) successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy. I know many true Star Wars fans hated George Lucas for changes he made to the original films	 but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what I didn't already know	 I think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity. Oh	 and	 err -- Carrie Fisher looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit."	1.0
"I saw two movies over the weekend	 One was ""kaal"" and the other ""Waqt"". Both movies are made in ""Bollywood"" but they are worlds apart. The fundamental difference is the Story and the Director. Vipul Shaw made his indelible mark with ""Ankhen""	 one of the best Comedy Hindi movies. His Casting of the Charecteres is perfect. The story apparently taken from a Gujerati Play is awesome	the treatment is superb with some exceptions. In Bollywood when a movie is put together the first thing a Bollywood Director is prone to do is sign up a music director and this guy (mediocre Malik in this instance)is obligated to drum up six songs to fulfill his contract. So even a good Director like Vipul Shah has to use them to appease the Finacier and the Grandma's who just cant get enough of these numbers. No Music director can churn out good songs relentlessly as clearly evident in this movie. None of the songs have any melody and they are clearly intrusive to the narration of the story except the background music and the westernized version of the Bharat-Natyam. The duelling and role playing the Father and Son is good acting by Bachachan and Akshay Kumar. His stunt scenes are clearly outstanding. A good director surrounds himself with good actors and he is willing to wait till a good story comes along as in this super movie. Then we have a cheap classless tasteless Producer like Sharukh Khan who will stoop low as to shamelessly plug and promote a trash like ""Kaal"" to enrich himself at the cost of the betterment of Art	 and they surround themselves with borderline talent	 and they recoup the investment before the word gets around. These are the Bollywood locusts who prey on the unsuspected audience to garner ""Film Farce"" awards given by Bollywood Chamcha's and most of them are in the Media."	1.0
"This is so bad	 so very very bad. The acting is the biggest joke in history. Don't even bother to see it	 i did ff it after 20 min and it was just as disappointing in the end as in the beginning... I really don't understand peoples taste	 I'm a horror movie fan and I'm not fastidious but I DO HAVE A LIMIT! Maybe it was a quarter of a star better then the beginning of The Hoast but that's it. So I recommend you don't waste the 15 minutes you'll be able to watch. I mean the acting is better done by monkeys. And the big brother with the parental role is just awful. Don't they pay characters in C-movies? No I must say it's not the first time I think a horror movie is bad but it's absolutely one in my down ten movies and it will be charing places with Portrait of a vampire	 Cabin by the lake	 The Hoast!"	0.0
"American Pie: Beta House is sort of in limbo between genres. On the one hand	 it's a comedy with no plot and few genuinely clever jokes. On the other hand	 it's porno that's a tad too soft-core to actually turn on any viewers. Essentially Beta House is a collage of sex scenes - some humiliating	 others just lame attempts at humor - with a couple thin plot points thrown in an effort at cohesiveness. The characters are barely even two-dimensional	 most development relies on knowledge of Naked Mile	 and the ""important"" plot scenes are so far apart that you wonder why the writers even felt the need for a story.<br /><br />In all fairness	 I did not go into this movie without expectations. I liked the original three American Pie movies	 and thought Band Camp and Naked Mile were solid rentals. I thought Naked Mile was almost good enough to be released in theaters	 and so when I saw that some of the same characters were returning for Beta House	 I was excited to see this installment. I was aware that there would be numerous scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in multiple forms. And I was fine with it	 because in the past	 these scenes were backed by the story and were well integrated into the plot. In Beta House	 however	 it's almost as if the writers forgot why the formula in the other AP movies worked. They spent too much energy working in the nudity that they forgot to actually write a story.<br /><br />This movie is a disappointment and not even worth a one-dollar rental. The jokes are lame	 the story is non-existent	 and the porno-aspect is too tame if that's all you really care about seeing."	0.0
"This movie was boring! <br /><br />Yes	 there are a few funny moments and jokes	 but you cannot base a whole movie on that! <br /><br />The characters are too stereotyped	 there is no real story - but short episodes with freaky side-characters	 who are not freaky enough to make the plot genuine.<br /><br />Shame	 because most of the actors are acknowledged in Hungary	 a mystery why they took the roles. <br /><br />This is *not* a new hope for the Hungarian film. It was boring	 though it was meant to be genuine or unique. They could have tried much more harder than this... 2 out of 10"	0.0
"I just saw this at the Venice Film Festival	 and can't quite decide about it. We were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them. Maybe that was the point	 that we are all in a ""bubble"" of our own	 but these people didn't compel me to be concerned about them or shocked at their various fates. At a running time of just over an hour	 the characters weren't very well developed. Lots of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment (forklifts	 conveyor belts	 shovels); and the slightly-creepy-looking baby dolls with surprisingly lifelike eyes	 that most of the characters made for a living	 were somehow more interesting than the live people. An interesting experiment	 but somehow it never quite came together."	0.0
"I actually intended to see this movie in the theatre. It was actually sold out. I actually went to see Solaris instead	 which actually was the worst movie to be released in 2002.<br /><br />Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo)	 a tough	 streetwise 'street pharmacist'	 freaks out when he sees a kid get shot	 so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Things seem to be going pretty well until Jack skips town with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). This happened very late in the movie	 so had they not revealed this in the preview	 it might have been an interesting twist. But they did	 so it's not.<br /><br />In fact	 there's not a single interesting thing about this movie; everything is given away in the preview. If you saw even one preview	 you saw the whole movie	 so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps. Go to the website	 download the preview	 save yourself $3.99. There is not a single surprise or twist in the entire film	 other than how terrible the soundtrack is.<br /><br />I hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired. Twice. Most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan duets	 and (I may shatter the fabric of the space-time continuum with a concept as mind-numbing as this) they both had less talent and musical ability.<br /><br />The acting is at best poor	 the script is at best a crime against humanity	 and Denise Richards is at best 67% styrofoam and 33% ziploc bag. You know things are bad when John Leguizamo (he was in The Pest!) upstages the rest of the cast with his acting abilities."	0.0
"Berlin-born in 1942 Margarethe von Trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer. She has been described	 perhaps even unfairly caricatured	 as a director whose commitment to bringing a woman's sensibility to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths. ""Rosenstrasse	"" which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews I've ever read in that paper) is not a perfect film. It is a fine movie and a testament to a rare coalescing of successful opposition to the genocidal Nazi regime by	 of all peoples	 generically powerless Germans demonstrating in a Berlin street.<br /><br />Co-writer von Trotta uses the actual Rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman's search for information about her mother's never disclosed life as a child in the German capital during World War II.<br /><br />The husband of Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) has died and in a surprising reversion to an orthodox Jewish lifestyle apparently hitherto in long abeyance	 Ruth not only ""sits shivah"" (the Jews' week-long mourning ritual) but she insists on following the strict proscriptions of her faith. Her apartment in New York City reflects the affluence secured by her deceased spouse's labors. Her American-born daughter	 Hannah (Maria Schrader) and her brother are a bit put-off by mom's assumption of restrictive orthodox Jewish practices but they pitch in. The mother coldly rejects the presence of Hannah's fiance	 a non-Jew named Luis (Fedja van Huet). A domestic crisis might well erupt as Ruth warns that she'll disown Hannah if she doesn't give up doting	 handsome Luis. Stay tuned.<br /><br />A cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested Hannah about a wartime mystery about mom's childhood in Berlin. Hannah is intrigued - she queries her mom who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of her life. This is very	 very realistic. I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany just in time and I knew many children whose families	 in whole but usually in part	 escaped the Holocaust. Those days were simply not discussed.<br /><br />So Hannah	 having learned that a German gentile woman saved Ruth's life	 traipses off to Berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing. Were she not	 this would have been a very short film. But Ruth	 pretending to be a historian	 locates 90 year-old Lena Fischer (Doris Schade)	 now a widow. As the happy-to-be-interviewed but shaken up by repressed memories Lena tells her story	 the scenes shift fairly seamlessly between present day Berlin and the war-time capital.<br /><br />The young Lena of 1943 (Katja Riemann) was a fine pianist married to a Jewish violinist	 Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel). With the advent of the Nazi regime he was required to use ""Israel"" as a middle name just as Jewish women had to add ""Sarah"" to their names(incidentally I wish IMDb had not given Fabian's name on its characters list with the false ""Israel"" included-it simply perpetuates a name applied by Nazis as a mark of classification and degradation).<br /><br />While Germany deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps	 those married to ""Aryans"" were exempted. For a time. Until 1943 when the regime decided to take them too (most were men; a minority were Jewish women married to non-Jews). The roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensity.<br /><br />The young Lena tries to locate her husband. All she and many other women know is that they're confined in a building on Rosenstrasse. The crowd of anxious women builds up	 some piteously seeking help from German officers who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse them (""Jew-loving whore"" being one appellation). As a subplot Lena more or less adopts eight-year-old Ruth who hid when her mother was seized (remember	 Ruth is now sitting shiva in Manhattan). The child Ruth is fetchingly portrayed by Svea Lohde. <br /><br />Through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail. The men	 and a handful of women	 are released. As in the real story the Nazis gave in	 one of the rare	 almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda (another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to rid the Reich of mental defectives and chronic invalids but that's another story).<br /><br />Von Trotta builds up the tension and each woman's story is both personal and universal. Hannah continues to prod the aging Lena who slowly	 one gathers	 begins to suspect she's not dealing with an ordinary historian but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she rescued	 the child whose mother was murdered.<br /><br />The contrasts between Rosenstrasse of 1943	 a set	 and the street today in a bustling	 rebuilt	 unified Berlin provide a recurring thematic element. Today's Berlin bears the heritage but not the scars of a monstrous past. Von Trotta makes that point very well.<br /><br />The main actors are uniformly impressive. Lena's husband while strong is also shown as totally helpless in the snare of confinement with a likely outlook of deportation (which is shown to have been clearly understood by all characters - including the local police and military - as a one-way trip to oblivion). The older Ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy New York life. Hannah is very believable as a young woman whose father's death triggers a need to discover her family's past. These things happen (although the Times's critic appears not to know that).<br /><br />Von Trotta's hand is sure but not perfect. A scene with Goebbels at a soiree enjoying Lena's violin playing is unnecessary and distractive. The suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister	 the most fanatical top-level Hitler worshiper	 to save her husband detracts from the wondrous accomplishment of the demonstrating spouses and relatives. Most of the German officers come from central casting and are molded by the Erich von Stroheim ""copy and paste"" school of Teutonic nastiness. But that's understandable.<br /><br />The Rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim it's a paradigm case for arguing that many more Jews could have been saved had more Germans protested. Unfortunately that argument is nonsense. The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably self-interested. Most Germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent anti-Semitism. THAT'S why the Rosenstrasse protest was virtually singular. Whether one buys or rejects the Goldenhagen thesis that most Germans were willing accomplices of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that pre-Nazi endemic anti-Semitism erupted into a virulent strain from 1933 on.<br /><br />The elderly Lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was ""a ray of light"" in an evil time. Most of the men and women sprung from a near death trip survived the war. So ""a ray of light"" it was and von Trotta's movie is a beacon of illumination showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists. And always will.<br /><br />9/10"	1.0

And Michael McDowell	 other horror author and the screenwriter of this abysmal film	 does so	 too. The lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible	 he is fat too	 haha!

"I think I read this someplace: Joe Johnston (director of the film and also one of the guys who founded Industrial Light and Magic for work on the first Star Wars film) and one of his producers or something were racking their brains for a title for the movie	 ""Rocket Boys"" (I guess) was lacking something.<br /><br />One day they were messing with a PC program that forms words from other words (ie: you type in a word or series of words and it mixes the letters up and forms other words) I think the technical term is an ""anagram""<br /><br />Anyway	 they typed in ""Rocket Boys"" and sure enough what comes back is ""October Sky"". They were shocked to say the least. The title summed up everything in the movie since the movie revolves around Sputnik.

"Watching Marlen Brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany. Brando's acting is the ONLY thing that makes this movie watchable. The plot is inane and laughable (not comic). The other big name actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters they portray some modicum of humanity... these characters have the humanity of wet cardboard. Everything about the technical side of this film is either mediocre or just plain awful. The director throws freeze-frame and slow-motion shots about with impunity. The incidental music is cartoonish and destroys any hint of dramatic effect. It's not something I really look for in a movie	 but even the wardrobe was way off. The venerable Brando couldn't take focus away from the awful rags they had him decked out in. I've heard this movie called ""David Lynch-esquire"" and ""irreverently funny""... it is neither. David Lynch films are borne of wicked creativity - this film was in no way creative. And don't confuse irreverence with stupidity."	0.0
"The story of Ned Kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand	 and this film is no exception. What ensures Ned Kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him. During several battles	 he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron	 off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce. Indeed	 it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the Victorian police who noticed he hadn't plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged. The story has been told in schools and histories of Australia for so long that some permutations of the story have	 ironically	 become boring. The more the stories try to portray Kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster	 the less people pay attention.<br /><br />Which is where this adaptation of Our Sunshine	 a novel about the Kelly legend	 excels. Rather than attempting to portray a Ned Kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore	 the film quickly establishes him as a human being. Indeed	 the reversal of the popular legend	 showing the corruption of the Victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists	 goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd. Here	 Ned Kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder	 one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it. No	 I am not making that up. About the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the Irish versus English mentality of the battles. While the Kelly gang were distinctly Irish	 Australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly (a scene with some Chinese migrants highlights this).<br /><br />Heath Ledger does an amazing job of impersonating Australia's most notorious outlaw. It is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching Ledger and not Kelly himself. Orlando Bloom has finally found a role in which he doesn't look completely lost without his bow	 and Geoffrey Rush's appearance as the leader of the police contingent at Glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state. But it is Naomi Watts	 appearing as Julia Cook	 who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film. Although the film basically implies that Cook was essentially the woman in Ned Kelly's life	 but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here. Indeed	 a lot of the film's hundred and ten minutes feels more freeze-dried than explorative. Once the element of police corruption is established	 in fact	 the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushed.<br /><br />Unfortunately	 most of the film's strengths are not capitalised upon. Rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits. Ditto for Watts	 and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins. I can only conclude that another fifteen	 or even thirty	 minutes of footage might have fixed this. But that leads to the other problem	 in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact. One scene manages to do the speech-making thing well	 but unfortunately	 it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while. If one were to believe the impression that this film creates	 a matter of weeks	 even days	 passes between the time that Ned Kelly becomes a wanted man on the say-so of one corrupt policeman	 and the infamous shootout at Glenrowan. Annoyingly	 the trial and execution of Ned Kelly is not even depicted here	 simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll.<br /><br />That said	 aside from some shaky camera-work at times	 Ned Kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts	 and it has a good beginning. For that reason	 I rated it a seven out of ten. Other critics have not been so kind	 so if you're not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements (and what could more more unusual than full body armour in a colonial shootout?)	 then you might be better off looking elsewhere. Especially if you want a more factual account of Ned Kelly's life."	1.0
"National Lampoon's Class Reunion is a classic comedy film from the early 80's which combines unique characters	 lots of laughs	 and some great music from Chuck Berry. When Walter Bailor is absolutely humiliated by his classmates at their high school graduation he seizes the opportunity to get his revenge at his class reunion. One by one he stalks his classmates who include an innocent blind girl	 a horny fat guy	 the high school beauty	 the king of all preps and even the ugly old lunch lady who served up slops to all the kids during highschool. This film has a sort of scary element in it and it has a few brief scenes of sexuality so I wouldn't recommend it for young children but it's a great movie for teens. If you are looking for a movie with a beautiful score	 complex characters or killer special effects you might not love Class Reunion. If you want to sit down for 90 minutes and have some great laughs and a lot of fun (and who doesn't) then this movie should be on your movies to see list. ++"	1.0
"I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival	 where it received a standing ovation! This film tells a story that to my knowledge has never been told before--namely about the Rosenstrasse (a street in Berlin)uprising of German gentile women who were married to Jews at the end of the Second World War. As such	 it is a unique story	 and what's more	 is the only film about the Holocaust that I have ever seen that shows that there were GOOD Germans (the helping family in ""Anne Frank"" for instance was Dutch) who did NOT support the Nazis	 and	 in fact	 had the fortitude to stand up against their own country's immorality and brutality during the Nazi regime	 at the risk of their very lives. The acting is great across the board	 the framing story in New York interesting and intricate	 the direction from Von Trotta masterful in every scene	 and the production values	 including the gorgeous cinematography	 outstanding. Of course the family in New York could be speaking German. Many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native tongue with their family--a common occurrence. So that criticism is unwarranted. To say more would spoil the experience. The film is long	 but I did not look at my watch once. I am hoping this film gets some distribution is North America	 for not only is this film a masterpiece	 but it can actually help heal any animosity people have towards the Germans because of their support of Hitler. If this film is playing in your area	 I URGE YOU TO SEE IT! You will be glad you did!"	1.0

"This one is tough to watch -- as an earlier reviewer says. That is amazing considering the terrible films that came out right after WWII -- particularly the ""liberation"" of Dachau. It is clear that	 as of the middle of the war	 we knew exactly what was happening to the Jews. The sequence that shows a ""transport"" is vivid	 almost as if based upon an actual newsreel (the Nazis liked to record their atrocities). Knox as the Nazi is brilliant. He charts the course of a Nazi career. That charting is particularly telling when contrasted with the reactions of other Germans	 at first laughing at Hitler	 then incredulous	 and finally helpless. That contrast	 however	 permits us to believe in the ""conversion"" of one young Nazi officer to an anti-Nazi stance. That did happen	 as witness the several attempts against Hitler	 most notably the Staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out. A strong film	 effectively using flashbacks	 accurately predicting the Nuremburg trails and others that would occur once the war ended."	1.0

"I am still trying to determine whether the previous installment was worse than this one	 or vice versa. Being that it is nearly fifteen years since I saw this film	 the fact that I remember so little about it does not bode well. Perhaps it is simply because I only watched it once or twice	 but I doubt it. If there was anything worth remembering about this film	 you can rest assured I would remember it.<br /><br />At the time this film was released	 the franchise was still entering its dying phase	 so a lot of media coverage was allotted to it. It's never a good sign when teenie pop magazines contain explanations of the plot basics. One such article had to explain that Freddy was left too weak to infest the dreams of grown humans	 so he decides to go after Alice's unborn son. So far	 so good	 but this is the job of the writer or the director to explain to the audience. It should not be left to some unrelated publication.<br /><br />Making use of the trivia given in part three about Freddy's conception	 one could half expect scenes that would lift this joke out of the ""horror for infants"" category	 but alas	 that was not to be. It goes to show the sheer idiocy of the American ratings system that a piece of B'harni-esque garbage like this could get the same rating as a genuinely frightening piece like the original.<br /><br />By this time	 the franchise could not attract anyone with an active career. Fortunately	 or unfortunately depending on how you look at it	 Lisa Wilcox was there to provide a quotient of competent acting. Or perhaps she just looks competent by comparison to the rest of the cast. Either way	 given that her last role was in something called The All New Adventures of Chastity Blade	 I doubt she really had anything else going for her. Even poor old Robert Englund has been in better productions than that in the past fifteen years.<br /><br />Given that box office returns were in a steady decline	 and not just for this franchise	 at the time	 one would have thought that the studios would realize neutering their films does not make them more saleable. In fact	 this particular film	 like its immediate predecessor	 was so neutered that not only did it fail to attract a new audience	 both succeeded in alienating the core audience that originally supported the franchise. Despite this	 part five must be given some credit for not having the bright	 luminescent feeling that made part four so insulting to look at.<br /><br />I gave A Nightmare On Elm Street Part Five a one out of ten. By trying to appeal to everyone	 or the MPAA's idea of everyone	 it succeeds in appealing to noone. Like parts two and four	 one could erase it from the continuity entirely	 and nobody would notice the difference."	0.0
"Really no reason to examine this much further because of a few very glaring and bias misleading statements.<br /><br />A perfect example is when the filmmaker claims ""Saul"" or Paul of Tarus (the writer of The Book of Hebrews He asserts) has no idea Jesus is or was a human being	 this assertion is either purposely false as he accuses others of presenting	 or he is ignorant of what ""The Bible"" says.<br /><br />first we can examine his misleading claim about Hebrews 8.4; which he shows a quote ""If Jesus was on earth	 he would not be a priest""	 hence right here He sets up the ignorant and unlearned viewer to accept his false premise.. why? He does what most so called Bible believing people he accuses of doing	 the same.. That is TAKING things out of context.<br /><br />verse one of Hebrews 8 is; 1..""Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest	 who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens"" The context above is CLEARLY speaking of a Jesus who was on earth and ASCENDED into heaven after his alleged resurrection.<br /><br />It has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to take his out of context scripture. Here he offers a foundation	 that ""Paul was not aware of a HUMAN Jesus	 but only one in ""heaven""<br /><br />follow?<br /><br />lets see if the filmmaker is being honest; Hebrews 7; 14. ""For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.""<br /><br />heh	 didn't the filmmaker just quote from the writer of Hebrews trying to show the writer of that book has no knowledge of a ""Human Jesus""? it's likely anyways Paul didn't write Hebrews	 but I will not go into that here	 but The film maker asserts Paul did	 and that is the premise of the point given here.<br /><br />It is not like this film maker does not make decent points in certain areas	 he does	 but he is engaging in the same blind bias of the religion he is bashing on. Once he engages in these tactics	 in my strong opinion	 he loses credibility as the religion he picks out	 and the film is no longer a documentary	 but a personal opinion	 and a bias of the film maker	 nothing more	 nothing less."	0.0
"As someone who was born to a German mother and English father (who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp) I come from unique position. One of having to deal with the various Nazis on one side of the family and the victors of WW2 on the other. This miniseries cannot delve into every single part of Hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general flavor of the situation at the time and as best as one can Hitler's state of mind. In this the series does quite well. Carlyle is very good as is O'Toole	 I would however liked to have got more information on the relationships with others in party Because Hitler did not do anything on his own. He had people around him that followed him to the letter often without question and certainly without question later on in his murderous career. What was going through Goebbels	 Goring and Hess's mind? It would have been helpful to see more of these relationships. But I hope it will make people research the subject more. It might also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to continue in power."	1.0
"This movie could be used in film classes in a ""How Not to Script a B-Movie"" course. There are inherent constrictions in a B-movie: Budgets are tight	 Time is precious (Scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days) and the actors are often green and inexperienced. The one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you. Scarecrow's script seems to have been written in a drunken haze. I could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie	 but I'll just mention one: The Gravedigger. The character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie. He seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie. He is shown with his daughter	 who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie. The gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count. Why give the Gravedigger a daughter? Why give the daughter a boyfriend? Why introduce them so late in the movie? Why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline? Scarecrow doesn't seem to care.<br /><br />The ""story"" of Scarecrow goes something like this: Lester is a high school kid (played by and actor who'd I'd peg to be in his early 30's) who is picked on by the other kids. He is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate named Judy. His mom is a lush and the town whore. One of her reprobate boyfriends makes fun of his drawings (by calling him a ""faggot"" for drawing birds instead of ""monsters and cowboys."" If you have a high school student still drawing cowboys I'd think him to more likely be gay than a high school student who draws crows) and later	 kills Lester	 in a cornfield	 under the titular scarecrow. Magically	 Lester's soul goes into the scarecrow. Somehow	 this transference changes Lester's soul from that of an artist into that of a wisecracking gymnast (I know some reviews have called the scarecrow a Kung-Fu scarecrow. I disagree. The scarecrow practically does a whole floor routine before jumping onto the truck during the climax of the movie). The scarecrow then goes on to kill those who tormented him	 those who smoke pot in the corn field	 those who dig graves	 boyfriends of daughters of gravediggers	 pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie set.<br /><br />The bonus feature on the DVD should be mentioned. The director (a Frenchman) does an impromptu version of rap music	 admits he enjoys not having executives around on set so he can screw his wife while working and gives a quote to live by (and I'm paraphrasing): ""Life ez a bitch	 but et has a great ass""<br /><br />Number of Beers I drank while watching this movie: 5 Did it help: No Number of Beers needed to enjoy this movie: Whatever it takes to get to blackout drunk level."	0.0
"So	 has it really come to this? Are we	 as consenting adults	 to blame for the next generation of cinema-goers lack of cinematic understanding and celluloid capability? Concerning the Wayans and Co. latest addition to the moving pictures scenario; Little Man. This United Kingdom P.G. (Parental Guidance)	 anyone under the age of twelve must be accompanied by a responsible adult	 certificated movie	 is the epitome of what has now developed into the worse case of dumbing down since cigarettes were ""wiped out"" from pictures of movie icons of the 1950's.<br /><br />The predominantly under twelve's audience here who	 some without grown up supervision too	 sat there	 obediently	 taking it all in	 oblivious to their subject and the partly grown up features that Little Man portrays	 in part at least too. Movies	 in general	 can do better than this poor attempt	 while this nonsense is getting them in while they are still young and fresh	 the biggest fear for the future of Cinema is that a child's ignorance just might carry on through to a grown up bliss. Cinema deserves more than this	 and so do its ever growing	 and in the literal sense too	 audiences	 this blatant cash cow feeds on the ever-impressionable minds of the young.<br /><br />There is no Cinema experience here	 no open eyed wonder	 no awe-inspiring respect to the magic of movies'. There is nothing but bewilderment and contempt	 for the lack of substance	 originality and its delivery of mind less tedium and parody of everything that is so now ultimately wrong with the Hollywood machine	 for the sake of a quick buck	 we must endure our future cinema audiences to the likes of this archetypal disaster movie.<br /><br />Will this have the likes of Hitchcock	 Fassbinder	 Leone	 Kubrick and Schaffner reeling in their graves? Money they all liked	 no doubt	 but talent and exuberance for perfection and quality	 and to a vast degree	 respect for their profession and audience	 they were never short off. We are seeing	 once again	 with the works of the Wayans clan another cliché of bad taste	 while the likes of White Chicks (2004) were in no doubt a stab at the bourgeoisie of American society. The irony here is that the two leading protagonists	 played yet again	 by the Wayans brothers	 are so much undercover	 that all recognition is non-existent	 this makes for a better movie too	 and it is the actor Terry Crews that gives White Chicks its substance and personality	 not the Wayans.<br /><br />Yet again	 with their pastiche of 1970's Blaxploitation movies	 as with the 1988 movie I'm Gonna Git You Sucka	 this to can be seen as a comical and amusing movie	 with heavy weights as Isaac Hayes	 Jim Brown	 Bernie Casey and the gorgeous actress Ja'net Du Bois. The point being	 that Little Man has absolutely no persona of any kind what so ever	 he is shallow and narcissistic	 with no appreciation or value toward his followers	 he quickly dives in takes your money and before we know it	 has hidden himself within the cogs of commercialism. There is no recognisable effort as to where our money has been spent	 after Scary Movie (2000)	 things could only have gone up	 but alas they did not	 no great pondering of artistic value and no doubt that the instalment from these intrepid movie moguls' next movies shall be straight to video	 one can only hope.<br /><br />The Wayans seem to have created a movie genre all by themselves	 to a certain extent; they have bludgeoned to death the movie parody	 they have watered down each and every avenue and with their inevitable style. They have slowly destroyed the reputation of the last one hundred years that Cinema have given us	 may the ghosts of movies past be ever so humble in their judgement	 as their growing audiences	 so far	 seem to be	 for when the bubble bursts	 may they be as understanding too."	0.0

"This movie is an awesome non-stop laugh riot incorporating all the usual ingredients of a Dawid Dhawan comedy - bumbling heroes 	 buffoonish supporting characters 	 made-up dolls for heroines 	 nasty villains 	 wisecracks 	 rocking soundtrack + choreography and a little dose of action . <br /><br />Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda both are in double roles of policemen and conmen .

"Something that really does not go down right with Al Gore (and his supporters)'s theory is the whole thing about ""concensus"".<br /><br />If there were such a consensus	 why is it that the ""believers"" in the almighty global warming feel the irrepressible need to try and bully anyone who questions them.<br /><br />Why is it that anyone who does not toe the line on global warming is met with smug accusations of being either stupid or on the payroll of the oil companies (apparently being a professional global warming researcher does not mean you're on anyone's payroll in that wondrous world...) Why is there such a need to tell everyone how the whole question is settled	 when it is the very nature of science to honestly question assumptions? For some ideas on the answer to those questions	 read Prey by the well-know oil-stooge Michael Crichton... oh wait	 he is rich and not on the payroll of the oil companies. He just took a huge career risk in not toeing the line of the Greens and other Kyoto worshippers and told the truth as he researched it. By the way did you know that abiding to the Kyoto protocol would result in almost no lowering of temperatures	 according to its own backers?

"I am not a big fan of horror films	 and have only seen a handful of them (and none of the ""Halloween""s or ""Friday the Thirteenth""s) - but I can appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore. And I'm pretty sure this isn't scary.<br /><br /> What's so spooky about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere? In all of its appearances there are faraway establishing shots	 so there's no real surprise in any of this film. (Not that a skull in of itself is that scary anyway	 but . . .)<br /><br /> The plot concerns Claus Von Bulow's third cousin (John Hudson)	 who marries a Donna-reed look-a-like (Peggey Webber	 giving one of the worst performances ever) who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husband's mansion. Did I mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident? OOOOH!!!! Wonder who did it!!!!<br /><br /> This is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill and/or drive their wife insane. If you want to see a well-done version of this stuff	 try ""Reversal of Fortune"". And BTW	 Jeremy Irons is one hundred times more talented than John Hudson.<br /><br /> The MSTing was okay but nothing special; paired with the ""Gumby"" short	 however	 it makes for good viewing.<br /><br /> Two stars for ""The Screaming Skull""; eight stars for the MST3K version.<br /><br /> And now	 to paraphrase Mr. Von Bulow himself: ""How bad is this film?""

"I enjoyed this film	 perhaps because I had not seen any reviews	 etc. It was delightful and a little bit of a 'romp'. I don't know why it didn't make more of a splash than it did. As far as the story goes	 I could relate to some aspects of the Paul Reiser character	 and I could ""see my dad"" in Falk's character. Made me remember a lot of past times when I was a kid and listening to my grandparents	 too. If you enjoyed movies like Grumpy Old Men or On Golden Pond	 this is your movie. A ""sleeper""	 in my opinion	 and one of those feel-good stories. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had many wonderful verbal tussles	 yet nothing was overdone. I would say it rates at least an 8	 perhaps higher."	1.0
"Everyone in this movie tells Raffy Carruthers how talented she is	 what a great director she'll one day turn out to be	 etc. I think they're just being nice. Even Kimble Rendall	 who directed this film	 shows more talent than she does. ""The next Jane Campion""	 they call her; and	 even apart from the fact that they're both over-rated	 the two have SO much in common. They both direct movies. They're both women. They're both Australian. (Well	 give or take.)<br /><br />Yep: it's one of those films in which a character is deemed to be brilliant	 and we just have to swallow hard and accept it. But I'll say this for Carruthers: she's cute. -And fascinating. No	 really. Here are some thoughts on her lack of talent:<br /><br />(1) Part of a director's talent lies in dealing with people. Why is Carruthers so phenomenally bad at getting her crew to even take notice of her? So as to make it easier for everyone to wander off the set and get killed	 I expect.<br /><br />(2) Why is this one of the most unconvincing depictions of a movie set I have ever seen? After all	 it must have been filmed on a REAL movie set. How could they get it wrong? If Rendall's set was half as much of an under-staffed shambles it's a wonder he completed his film at all.<br /><br />(3) Carruthers - the fictional director - has set herself the task of creating a brand new 1980s horror flick. Fat chance. I doubt it can be done these days. I suspect that Rendall - the actual	 and more talented	 director - set himself the same task	 realised it couldn't be done	 and settled for (sigh) knowing parody instead. Of course	 it's not ENOUGH of a parody to work as a parody. As soon as the cast and crew set foot in the isolated mansion the film just spends most of its time doing badly what 1980s horror films did ... well	 less badly.<br /><br />(4) And yet	 and yet ... the film opens with not a parody but an honest-to-goodness pastiche of 80s horror	 starring (this is too good to be true) Molly Ringwald. This pastiche is much better than anything that follows. (It's a bad sign when you find yourself wishing you were watching the movie-within-the-movie	 rather than the movie.) Yet it	 too	 was filmed in the late 1990s. Perhaps it IS still possible to make 1980s horror. You just have to drop the knowing parody stuff and MEAN it.<br /><br />(5) I'd never once wondered what 1980s teen horror would be like if all the characters had Australian accents	 but now I know. And strangely	 I'm glad I know. A need I never knew I had has been fulfilled."	0.0
"Movies like this one	 and C.R.A.Z.Y.	 make me very sad for American films with a gay subject matter. With the exception of Parting Glances and Brokeback Mountain	 there are few other notable American films with the kind of depth and sincerity as this movie	 The Bubble. This movie centers on two men	 Noam and Ashwar	 an Israle and Palestinian respectively. Their relationship is complicated by the tension between the Jews and Arabs in Israel. Couples	 in the early stages of their relationships will struggle with who will call who next	 or who will say ""I love you"" first. Noam and Ashwar's early love is complicated by suicide bombings	 armed security check points	 and racism. While Noam's friends accept and like Ashwar	 who is Arab	 it is clear that most of Tel Aviv's citizens probably don't.<br /><br />One of the most touching moments	 and there are many in this film	 is when Noam and Ashwar attend a production of ""Bent"". We	 as movie goers	 see them watching this play	 and the affect it has on the two of them is profoundly captured in their eyes. And ultimately	 this touching moment is played out in a very sad way in the finale of the movie.<br /><br />Ohad Knoller and Youseff 'Joe' Sweid are outstanding as Noam and Ashwar. Director Eytan Fox is brilliant in creating a cogent and interesting retelling of the Shakespeare classic Romeo and Juliet. And while most movies today have sex in them	 (almost as a sport)	 this one goes back to the old tried and true version of sex with love and passion combined. It is so refreshing. Also refreshing is seeing two gay men being portrayed as people and not cartoons. There are cartoonish characters in this movie. It just doesn't happen to be the two gay guys for a change. Somewhere on this site I think I read a comparison between this movie and ""Friends"". Well	 not really. Yes	 these are youthful characters stumbling through their first uneasy steps into adulthood and relationships. But I don't recall getting ""blowed up"" as a backdrop to the insipid story lines in ""Friends"".<br /><br />This is a very good movie. It has heart	 and heartbreak. And like all good love stories love does win out. But not in it's intact glory of full bloom . Still	 it's a very satisfying movie to watch."	1.0
"Was this movie stupid? Yup. Did this movie depth? Nope. Character development? Nope. Plot twists? Nope. This was simply a movie about a highly-fictionalized Springer show. It shows the lengths that some people will go to get their mugs on TV. Molly Hagan did a great job as Jaime Pressly's mom. Jaime is....well...GORGEOUS! This flick wasn't so much made to be a ""breakthrough"" movie	 rather	 it was intended to life in a trailer park (I live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like the one in this movie) where everyone sleeps with everyone else	 all the girls get pregnant by different guys	 and all the guys drive rusted-out '66 Ford pickups (exaggeration	 of course	 but that's the picture everyone sees when you mention ""trailer park""). Some people over-analyze movies (case-in-point: Star Trek freaks). I watch movies purely for the entertainment value; not to point out that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene (read the ""Goofs"" bit about Connie's shirt. Could it have been better? Sure. But it was funny as hell."	0.0
"As a child I preferred the first Care Bear movie since this one seemed so dark. I always sat down and watched the first one. As I got older I learned to prefer this one. What I do think is that this film is too dark for infants	 but as you get older you learn to treasure it since you understand it more	 it doesn't seem as dark as it was back when you were a child.<br /><br />This movie	 in my opinion	 is better than the first one	 everything is so much deeper. It may contradict the first movie but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one. The cubs are just too adorable	 I rewind that 'Flying My Colors' scene. I tend to annoy everyone by singing it.<br /><br />The sound track is great! A big hand to Carol and Dean Parks. I love every song in this movie	 I have downloaded them all and is all I am listening to	 I'm listening to 'Our beginning' also known as 'Recalling' at the moment. I have always preferred this sound track to the first one	 although I just totally love Carol Kings song in the first movie 'Care-A-Lot'.<br /><br />I think the animation is great	 the animation in both movies are fantastic. I was surprised when I sat down and watched it about 10 years later and saw that the animation for the time was excellent. It was really surprising.<br /><br />There is not a lot of back up from other people to say that this movie is great	 but it is. I do not think it is weird/strange. I think it is a wonderful movie.<br /><br />Basically	 this movie is about how the Care Bears came about and to defeat the Demon	 Dark Heart. The end is surprising and again	 beats any 'Pokemon Movie' with the Care Bears Moral issues. It leaves an effect on you. Again this movie can teach everyone at all ages about morality."	1.0
"An Insomniac's Nightmare was an incredibly interesting	 well-made film.

I was very impressed by the look of the film	 too. Usually	 ""independent films"" have a grainy	 I-shot-this-on-my-camcorder look to them	 but this director knows what she's doing.

After the act	 he lays in the bed with her not touching her.

I have never been more proud of him...""<br /><br />The young father's older sister	 who otherwise is cold towards her brother	 begins to show pride in her sibling	 ""You have been cool about this	"" as she gives him an encouraging warm hug.<br /><br />The 15-year-old father wants to be a father.

"One of the worst films ever. Not funny	 poor TV style cinematography	 bad acting. Sad to see so many famous old actors barely able to walk	 let alone act. Lead female Nancy Young can't act. Terrible direction. Sub-par with bad TV movies. Occasional weak jokes fall flat. Even the basic premise of the movie makes no sense. Somehow they are supposed to stop a wedding from happening but there's no logic behind their actions. Slow pacing made my wife stop watching but I suffered through it. The old men are supposed to be acting like they are young and horny	 but it comes off as pathetic instead of funny. How did they even get the money to make this?"	0.0
"House of Games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels. It is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller. It is blessed with marvelous performances by Lindsay Crouse and Joe Montegna	 and a strong	 strong cast of supporting players	 and it introduces Ricky Jay	 card sharp extraordinaire	 prestidigitator and historian of magic. Its dialogue	 written by David Mamet	 is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie (in which reality is often in question) an extra dimension of unrealness.<br /><br />On the face of it	 House of Games is a convincing glimpse into the unknown world of cheats and con men	 diametrically different from The Sting	 which was played merely for glamour and yuks. At this level it does succeed admirably.<br /><br />However	 you cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization. The only movie I know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated Private Benjamin. That thoroughly enjoyable movie unfortunately diffuses its focus	 hopping among several themes and exploiting the fine performance of Goldie Hawn to chase after some easy laughs. House of Games sticks to its business. As Poe once said of a good short story	 it drives relentlessly to its conclusion.<br /><br />There is another strain of movies-about-women	 epitomized by Thelma and Louise	 a big budget commercial money maker with the despicable theme that women are doomed	 whether or not they realize their inner strengths. What tripe.<br /><br />As usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater. It should be a natural for film festivals. Nominate it for one near you if you get the chance.<br /><br />I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23 year old daughter. Better she should see it on a TV than not at all."	1.0

"Alain Chabat is a fine actor	 writer and director but maybe a trifle misguided to take an 'idea' credit for a story that probably had them rolling in the aisles when Aristophanes was still learning that it's 'i' before 'e' except after 'c'. But	 like I said	 Chabat is a fine actor and he can do charm when he needs to. I'm also gradually overcoming an aversion to Charlotte Gainsbourg who also turns in an accomplished performance. If you absolutely insist on knowing	 the 'plot' is the one about the guy well into his forties and more than content to be single. This doesn't sit well with his mother and five sisters and to get them off his back he makes an 'arrangement' with the sister of a colleague to pose - for fifteen thousand euros -as his new girlfriend	 allow the romance to come to fruition with a wedding and then jilt him	 thus getting him off the hook. Naturally they wind up together but along the way there's some sub-Benedek and Beatrice duelling and all things considered it's a pretty painless ninety minutes and performing so well at the French box office that a sequel may not be out of the question."	1.0
"This ludicrous film offers the standard 1970's ""hippie mentality"" in a nut shell and bores us in the process. Its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young	 innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups. A naive young hippy played by the waif-like ( Kay Lenz ) hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys	 and then one day she meets the ridiculous (Holden)	 already in old age	 hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor	 and she decides that she is in ""love"" with him. If you think that is superficial	 the whole film encapsulates such scenes. She keeps saying how much she ""loves"" him and she only met him	 it wears thin and really quick. I couldn't help but laugh throughout the film. Its obvious she's just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place. A disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex	 I had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit. A corny offering of music from the 70's is also spread through the film. Avoid this if you can. Grade D."	0.0
"Deranged and graphically gory Japanese film about little beings taking people over and turning them into necroborg-zombie like machines- which beat and hack each other apart so that the winner can eat the loser. In the middle of this a pair of lovers become infected.<br /><br />Technically superb horror comedy(?) is only for those with strong stomachs as blood and body parts go flying. Good taste prevents me from describing what happens here	 but lets just say its pretty gruesome. If you like this sort of thing with form several steps above slender content by all means see this film. Personally I'm not normally one to enjoy films like this on anything but the how sick and twisted do they go level. Here I was intrigued enough that I can suggest it to people I know who like really gory movies.. Its also a film with enough going on in the details that I want to see it again since now that I know what was going on-as revealed in the end-I want to go back and see what it was I didn't catch on to. There is an internal logic rare in these films.<br /><br />7ish out of 10 for those who like blood and severed limbs	 its a zero or more precisely a run and hide alert for everyone else."	1.0
"Since the Little Mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was little	 I was curious about its sequel.<br /><br />The Little Mermaid(one) is a classic animated feature with top quality everything	 a grand music score	 and targets a general audience. In contrast	 the Little Mermaid 2 is targeted primarily at young children	 because it is spontaneous	 reflects a child's self perspective	 the music is bouncier and less dramatic	 and the ending feels like recess.<br /><br />The Little Mermaid 2 starts out when baby Melody is presented to Ariel's side of the family. Abruptly without any visual cues to aid the drama	 a giant tentacle grabs the baby. I laughed	 wait a minute it's not funny	 the baby's being attacked! Okay	 I'll stop laughing. Morgana's crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity	 takes away potential drama since it happened so quickly.<br /><br />Throughout the feature	 Melody seems superhuman	 which I defend is how most children envision themselves. This quality in Melody's character is clearly brought out toward the end when she fights Morgana without an inch of fear on her face.<br /><br />Like the first movie	 Melody has a lot of Ariel's problems	 except the reverse. Queen Ariel turns out to be like her father by restricting her from the ocean	 whereas King Triton restricted Ariel from the surface. Ariel and Melody both rebel against their parent.<br /><br />The music is more emotionally moving in the first. This sequel has a bunch of songs	 but not as much orchestral work went into it. It's great for little ones	 because it doesn't take an orchestra to impress them.<br /><br />The ending in the first movie was strong and uplifting. The sequel ends with a bouncy song and everyone playing in the water. It's definitely more targeted at kids	 because instead of the ending being solemn and leaving you blown away	 this ending leaves you thinking	 ""It's time for recess!"" Ultimately	 this movie is fun for kids	 so we should let them have fun."	0.0
"Well i do disagreed with the other comment posted. Piedras is much much better them Magnolia or any of the other films that were mentioned.<br /><br />specially about non real characters	 i think that someone just wrote that only because he never lived in the Spanish society like i did (and i'm not Spanish)	 is a very real film with real characters	 very well done by one of the best Spanish actress Antonia San Juan.<br /><br />about be a European film in contrast with an American film	 well we different societies	 personally i dislike American modern films a lot (i like the classics and some of the Andy American films but they are very few).<br /><br />Is a film about the continuous Constitution of a person	 liked or not we all make mistakes but some can learn about the mistakes."	1.0
"This movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy. It is an extreme tragedy. It left me sick to my stomach. I hated it. I think if they want to make a movie like this than they should be man enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer. I would not have seen this movie if I would have known. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a movie. I am tired of it. I really wanted to have a fun comedy and I am extremely disappointed. It has been several days now and I still have a bad taste in my mouth from this movie. I have never been more disappointed in a movie	 nor have I ever written a comment on a bad movie. I really think that true deception was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true intention of the movie	 no one would have seen it."	0.0
"Men	 do I love police movies filled with action	 shooting	 chases etcetera.<br /><br />Boy	 was I let down after watching this short and unsatisfying movie. We've seen it all before	 the hostages	 the bank	 the surrounding... Yet	 2 bad guys that shoot down multiple officers and innocent people who simply stay in the line of fire - without getting hit due to some Kevlar.<br /><br />Not just a few shots	 no	 hundreds of shots. Going back into the bank	 where the dumb hostages didn't lock the safe or doors when the bad guys went out. How stupid did the director think we'd be.<br /><br />Okay	 the shots in between that fake a documentary were good	 but after seeing the film I only got the thought: why didn't the police get a decent shooting course? And why where there so many cops and was SWAT on a real long break. Truly bad."	0.0
"The cast of this film contain some of New Zealander's better actors	 many of who I have seen in fabulous roles	 this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them. The fake American accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong. As another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry	 decorated with a few of the multi colour flags stolen from a used car lot. Most of the cast appear to be from the (great) long running New Zealand soap Shortland Street. It's as if this movie was dreamt up at a Shortland Street cast Christmas party	 the result of too many gins	 and possibly a bit of salmonella. Imagine ""Under Siege"" meets ""The Love Boat""	 staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the idea.<br /><br />If you are an actor	 I recommend you see this film	 as a study on how to destroy your carer."	0.0
"When i got this movie free from my job	 along with three other similar movies.. I watched then with very low expectations. Now this movie isn't bad per se. You get what you pay for. It is a tale of love	 betrayal	 lies	 sex	 scandal	 everything you want in a movie. Definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster	 but for cheap thrills it is not that bad. I would probably never watch this movie again. In a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time	 or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time. Despite the bad acting	 cliché lines	 and sub par camera work. I didn't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my DVD player. The story has been done many times in many movies. This one is no different	 no better	 no worse. <br /><br />Just your average movie."	0.0
"CCCC is the first good film in Bollywood of 2001. When I first saw the trailer of the film I thought It would be a nice family movie. I was right. Salman Khan has given is strongest performance ever. My family weren't too keen on him but after seeing this film my family are very impressed with him. Rani and Preity are wonderful. The film is going to be a huge hit because of the three main stars. <br /><br />It's about Raj (Salman Khan) and Priya meeting and falling in love. They get married and go to Switzerland for their honeymoon. When they come back Raj and Priya find out that Priya is pregnant. Raj's family are full of joy when they find out especially Raj's dada (Amrish Puri). Raj and his family are playing cricket one day and Priya has an accident which causes Priya to have a miscarriage. Raj has a very close family friend who is a doctor	 Balraj Chopra (Prem Chopra). He tells Raj and Priya that she can no longer have anymore kids. Raj and Priya keep this quiet from the family. Raj and Priya decide to go for surrogacy. Surrogacy to them is that they will find a girl and Raj and that girl will have a baby together and then hand the baby over to Raj and Priya. Raj finds a girl. Her name is Madhubala (Preity Zinta). She is a dancer and a prostitute. Raj tells her the situation and bribes her with money and she agrees. Raj changes Madhubala completley. Raj tells Priya that he has found a girl. Madhubala and Priya meet and become friends. They go to Switzerland to do this so no one finds out. Priya spends the night in a church and Raj and Madhubala are all alone and they spend the night together. The doctor confirms that Madhubala is pregnant and they are all happy. Raj tells his family that Priya is pregnant. They are happy again. Madhubala comes to love Raj and she wants him. What happens next? Watch CCCC to find out. <br /><br />The one thing I didn't like about the film is their idea of surrogacy. They should have done it the proper way in the film but it didn't ruin the film. It was still excellent.<br /><br />The songs of the film are great. My favourites are ""Chori Chori Chupke Chupke""	 Dekhne Walon Ne""	 ""Deewana Hai Yeh Mann"" and ""Mehndi"". The song ""Mehndi"" is very colourful. In that song it shows the ghod bharai taking place and it is very colourful. The film deserves 10/10!"	1.0
"That's what one of the girls said at the end.<br /><br />Is the soccer game a metaphor for a qualifying game between the girls (or more broadly	 a free-thinking group) and the authority? ""To Germany"" means to a future that's of hope? <br /><br />It's one of the most unforgettable cinematic experience I've ever had -- despite the crude cinematography and plot	 and mild over-acting (though I like the cast -- they're lovable and well above the expectation for amateurs). The ridiculous situation is well captured. I can feel the deep frustration being denied to a game (being female and a soccer fan) and I cannot stop thinking how to make a convincing disguise. I wonder why there's no women's section in which protection from dirty language and bad behavior can be provided -- defeating the flawed reasons for the deny.<br /><br />The movie is very cleverly made -- the amazing title	 the filming during the actual game	 the spontaneity	 and various methods to put the viewers into the shoes of the characters -- the game that's so important but inaccessible (not shown)	 the luring light and cheering sound from the stadium	 the confinement of the van	 and the uselessness of it when those inside connect with the celebrating crowds outside. I can feel the comfort coming from the radio	 the drinks and the food	 and of course	 the kindness and consideration from each character to others. During the end credits	 I am amused that no character has a name -- he's just any ""soldier"" and she's just any ""girl"" or ""sister""."	1.0
"Why would any legitimate actor having read the script participated in this piece of crap? My god it is actually embarrassing to even watch it. I can't imagine the shame these people must feel for being a part of it. Also	 there is apparently some controversy as to whether River Phoenix had a cameo in the movie. He was uncredited but his list of roles here (IMDB) does give him credit. BTW... Rain is his sister for those who have were asking before. This film is proof that no matter how many big ""names"" you have. Sow's ears don't make silk purses. I love Lorraine Bracco but this was just sad	 sad	 sad... Maybe somebody someday can explain to me the reason for this kind of film. It has no endearing	 entertaining	 or even comedic properties in comparison to it's bad everything else."	0.0
"The film really challenges your notions of identity and the society we live in. It is well made and very powerful. The persons in the film are honest and revealing about the world that exists outside of the normative ideological perspective. I believe it give great insight into a sub-culture who shakes the very ideas that the viewer has of society. It is shocking at times and more powerful because of it. Some parts were difficult to watch	 as most reality is	 but it is not over done. Its good the first time you watch it	 but it becomes even better the second or third time around; because you have had the chance to wrap your mind around the very topics they discuss and challenge."	1.0
"Words cannot describe how utterly abysmal this movie is. It is a series of random	 unfunny clips about everything from a stupid Batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady (REALLY disturbing). The only remotely amusing thing about the Underground Comedy Movie is watching Joey Buttafuoco	 the best actor in this movie. Also	 it is rated NC-17	 shunning away the only people that might tolerate it."	0.0

"I watched this over the Christmas period	 I don't know why but it reminds me of Christmas so I watched it	 so there we are. <br /><br />Arthur is a film I watch all the way through with a big dumb smile on my face and its a mixture of special performances	 great jolly music and a script crackling with wit and charm that causes it. <br /><br />Dudley Moore makes a character that could well be hated very easily (spoiled	 rich	 lazy drunk who feels sorry for himself) but turns him into someone you love. Liza Minelli is great as Linda Morolla a queens waitress who manages to pull off the tough/soft on the inside lady Arthur nearly gives up his world for. John Gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them off with relish. <br /><br />I can watch Arthur again and again and it always makes me feel good	 check it out if you need a lift its a lovely film."	1.0
"We gave up at the point where George Clooney's character has his finger-nails extracted. We were not squeamish - having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like. To say this film was incomprehensible	 boring	 pretentious twaddle would be to over-praise it! How did people manage to sit through this confusing	 slow	 depressing pseud's corner of a film	 let alone nominate it for an Oscar? Clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him. What was he thinking? Oh .. and what was with those subtitles? - did we just have a dud DVD or was the original film done like that - sentences left hanging in mid-air? The film was hard enough to follow without that as well. I pity the cast	 who obviously did their best with the material available."	0.0
"OK	 aside from the psychedelic background imagery	 the info presented here was good. The music I could have done without (not that it was bad music	 just that it didn't fit this film at all).<br /><br />As for the content of the film	 the director brings up the often-lacking Pagan perspective on Christ's existence and a startling comparison of the deeds and events of Christ's life vs. the lives of mythological figures/deities such as Mithra and Dionyses. Then he brings up the chronology of Christianity's origins and presents an 'ok' case	 but not one that blew me away.<br /><br />If the director had stuck with the facts and continued on with them	 this film would have been good. However	 at this point in the film	 it disintegrates into a group of personally-gratifying attacks on Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ"" and a Christian private school which the director attended in his youth. During an interview with his old principal	 (which during the course of	 it comes to light that the director set up under false pretenses) I felt that the director was acting sort of childish. He was asking good questions but	 like the film itself	 the interview crumbled into an attack on this particular private school's rules	 not Christianity.<br /><br />All in all	 if you're just interested in some info	 watch the first 30 minutes or so and then shut it off."	0.0
"Disappointing	 predictable film in which a woman (Mc Teer) travels with her daughter from state to state because she can't maintain relationships and find happiness.

"I stopped watching lost at this episode because I thought Ana-Lucia and Libby's deaths were unnecessary and really depressing. Then I found out that they kept Libby around just to die in the next episode! Gah! I can't handle it.<br /><br />I liked this show for the first season	 but it definitely declined in the second season	 I found Jack and Locke's little religious feud to be annoying. The deaths of Rodriguez & Watros' characters was the final straw! <br /><br />I give this episode a 4/10	 for being the end to my viewing of this formerly great series created by Alias legend J.J. Abrams. I hope his series in the future will improve on this one."	0.0
"I went to see this movie simply to see what all the hype is about	 and I was as disappointed as surprised about how it got 6(?) Oscars and 7.9 rating on IMDb as of today.<br /><br />Kathryn Bigelow should be the luckiest director ever to win the best picture and best direction Oscar for this sort of a really really bad movie and I wonder why? Did the totally unrealistic 'cowboy' bomb disposal-man storyline mean anything to somebody that I failed see? Why did I keep getting the mental image that this movie was a remake of some old bad Western movie about a cowboy doing 'brave deeds' in the Wild Wild West infected with 'evil' Red Indians; but just that it was set in a different background this time? Was it given the Oscars because the director being ex of James Cameron	 and made it a nice underdog (gossipy) story for day time TV shows to munch on? Or was it some sort of Emperor's Clothes syndrome - where most people realized it was junk but just couldn't say so because others didn't seem to be saying it out aloud?<br /><br />And finally what was with that sniper scene where they showed the shell casing dropping in high-resolution-super-slow-mo as if to convey a 'deep message' or something? Something in the lines of 'EOD guys make good snipers all of a sudden and they will get the filthy terrorists all the time'? Was it just me who felt like there were so many bits and pieces here and there in the movie squeezed in for no apparent reason? And you can get the Oscars for editing and directing for that??<br /><br />If you haven't seen this yet	 don't waste your money on tickets. Wait till they run it on TV in a few years. You are not going to miss much."	0.0
"This TV movie goes to show that bad films do exist. The only reason I saw this was it was covered on a KTMA MST3K. It's Super Bowl at the Superdome in New Orleans.

I really don't know why I watched this."	0.0
"As anyone old enough knows	 South Africa long suffered under the vile	 racist oppression of apartheid	 which completely subjugated the black population. One of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko	 who was murdered in jail. Following the murder	 reporter Donald Woods sought to get Biko's message out to the world.<br /><br />In ""Cry Freedom""	 Woods (Kevin Kline) befriends Biko (Denzel Washington) before the latter is arrested on trumped up charges. When Woods attempts to spread Biko's word	 he and his family begin living under threat of attack	 and they are finally forced to flee the country. The last scene gut-wrenchingly shows police firing on protesters.<br /><br />As one of two movies (along with ""A World Apart"") that helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement	 ""Cry Freedom"" stands out as possibly the best ever work for all involved."	1.0
I gave this movie a 10 because it needed to be rewarded for its scary elements and actors AND my god the enging!

"I have nothing more to say but it was awful. I cannot imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this degrading mess. And if certain actors don't want people to question their sexuality then perhaps they should refrain from making more of these films. There was at least one seen that left me curious. Just my opinion. SHUDDER to think what was going on that was cut from the film. SHUDDER to wonder what went through the minds of the actors who made this film. Shudder to think about the thought process and voyeurism that went on in the directors mind. Like I stated before its a degrading mess. Its not even funny. As Ebert said of the film Caligula with Malcolm McDowell	 Its not a good film	 not a good story and its not even good porn. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH............"	0.0
"The reviews I read for this movie were pretty decent so I decided to check it out. BAD IDEA! This is another movie about a ghost out for revenge against a group friends. The story is stupid	 mix two parts Ringu with one part Prom Night	 a sprinkle of I Know what you did Last Summer	 and add a tiny dash of Single White Female - now blend until completely nonsensical. There is nothing new to this plot	 and revisiting the clichés I've grown so fond of wasn't even entertaining this time. This movie jumps to and from the past too much	 and once I made sense of it all I realized it still didn't make much sense. Characters go from sane to psycho killer in the blink of an eye. Speaking of characters	 they are all your stereotypical favorites - the greedy selfish lawyer	 the egocentric actress	 the has-been baseball star	 the video voyeur	 the bitter girl	 the spooky quiet chick	 the 'nicer-than-nice' nice girl	 a freakin' black cat... and I didn't care about any of them. Perhaps a better writer could have made the movie work	 there were some decent scenes in it	 but overall this movie was a mess. I should also mention a certain 'video tape' that would have been IMPOSSIBLE to shoot. <br /><br />This movie isn't the worst Asian horror has to offer by far	 but it is still pretty bad. If you just want to see some creepy images in the dark	 or just want to laugh out loud at some over the top acting	 or just want to yell ""you're stupid!"" at a movie screen	 or just want to have another Asian horror flick up your sleeve when someone asks you how many you've seen - this movie is for you. <br /><br />Those seeking a decent plot look elsewhere."	0.0
"I watched this knowing almost nothing about it	 other than the brief description I read here. After watching it I was originally going to say that the director shows promise but seems kind of amateurish	 then I looked at the other stuff he's done to see if this was his first or second movie	 but no	 he did House on Haunted Hill and Fear Dot Com. He sort of missed the mark on both those movies and it was the same with this one.<br /><br />The story was pretty awful too	 could someone just fall in love with a girl because she's pretty but has the mind of a child? I gave it a 3 because there were some visuals that I rather enjoyed near the end but as a whole this movie is pretty terrible."	0.0
"One piece of trivia that is often forgotten about this family film is one of business.<br /><br />At the time	 in 1994	 this movie held the record for the biggest movie premiere in motion picture history (and may continue to hold). It was held in Pittsburgh	 Pennsylvania - no doubt in honor of the original film's ""Angels"" who ""haunted"" the Pittsburgh Pirates. In this remake they ""haunt"" the California Angels.<br /><br />Anyway	 the premiere was held at the long gone Three Rivers Stadium which was the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Steelers at the time (the Pirates are now housed in PNC Park and the Steelers at Heinz Field). The premiere was held on a movie screen that was five stories in height inside the stadium and held (and may even continue to hold) the record for the largest movie premiere in history	 shown to 60	000 fans. Danny Glover	 Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd were all in attendance to the admiration of thousands of sports fans."	1.0
"As someone who has read the book	 I can say that this is vastly inferior to the big American version starring Gwyneth Paltrow. There are various reasons for this. Firstly	 Emma is too unpleasant. Yes	 she has faults	 and isn't the easiest person to like - but the viewer shouldn't downright start to despise her. Secondly	 Mr Knightly is miscast. His brooding and melancholy in this version are better suited to a Bronte or Gaskell adaptation than Austen	 and throw the mood of the whole affair ""off"". Thirdly	 Samantha Morton is too strong an actress to be relegated to the role of Harriet; and why was she made to look so sickly? Harriet is supposed to be blonde and blooming - not to look as if she's going to be carried off by consumption in the next scene. Fourthly	 the structure has been mucked up and scenes cut. At the end	 when Emma decides she loves Mr Knightly	 it comes across as utterly baffling because this narrative hasn't been adequately shown and carried along throughout the film. Fifthly	 what was going on	 exactly	 with Mrs Elton's accent? She went from sounding like an American actress trying to suppress her own accent at the beginning	 to all out American half-way through	 and then back to English at the end. Finally	 this dragged at the end. The book and the big film version end with the wedding of Emma and Mr Knightly. This version drags on confusingly after the announcement of the wedding without actually showing us the ceremony.<br /><br />All in all	 a rather haphazard attempt. Read the book or rent the Paltrow version instead"	0.0
"I adored this movie. Not only because I am a big fan of Moritz Bleibtreu	 although he is in practically all German movies that count. But also because he is NOT the main actor. The lead is taken over by Barnaby Metschurat	 who was the only reason to watch 2001's Julietta	 and who really carries this movie on his shoulders.<br /><br />A family moves from Italy to Germany seeking ""the German dream"" (this is my own invention and ironic...) of cheap labor in steel and coal industries. However	 they end up opening a restaurant and the journey the movie takes to this point alone is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming. From this point onward	 the story told is mainly that of the two brothers of this family	 Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gigi's dream to become a filmmaker is threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mother's determination to return to Italy. What follows is a great - and totally neutral - look at what life can become formed by the choices you make.<br /><br />In the end	 this movie doesn't say which life (Gigi's or Giancarlo's) was more successful or fuller or more interesting. It merely gives us a rewarding glimpse at what it must be like to search for identity when two countries and mentalities are involved. and this look is not driven by bitterness or disdain to either country	 which makes it such a great film for any and every country dealing with the tensions resulting from immigration. The fact that director Fatih Akin's moved to Germany from Turkey in the 70s also lends this movie a large measure of its credibility and emotional accuracy. The icing on the cake are fantastic performances by the entire cast	 especially Metschurat and - this I really need to stress - the little boy who plays young Gigi. That kid's performance would be a hard act to follow by just about anyone! Great movie	 go see it."	1.0
"Well to answer one persons's question of ""why doesn't anyone remember this film?"" it's because really	not that many people saw it in 1978 and it's not been shown much on TV since. (If it's on video that'd be news to me!) Even in the era of sometimes mindless comedies that was the '70s	movie-goers had the smarts to avoid this film. Unless they love Billy Crytal	Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers ""that"" much! <br /><br />Paul Lynde was funnier on ""Bewitched"" or ""Hollywood Squares"" than here. Joan Rivers at this time in her career was getting laughs making cruel jokes about singer Karen Carpenter's lack of weight! Har-har Joan! It also seems like every ""somewhat"" famous name from the era is in the cast. (Most surprising is Doris Roberts later of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"".)<br /><br />Anyhow	a somewhat good idea for a storyline	a man getting pregnant instead of the woman goes to waste here. With help from a male friend Crystal gets set up with a hooker to finally lose his virginity but because she was ""on top"" instead of him	he gets pregnant! (A commentary on women taking positions of power away from men).<br /><br />Crystal's stomach grows	he goes through all the female emotions and related feelings. Unfortunately	he is now a socially misunderstood outcast! He's attacked by a mob who wants him rubbed out (I guess).<br /><br />He's forced to go into seclusion to have his baby...in a barn. Or if you will	a manger (God only knows where it may have exited from! Ewwww!) It turns out (no shock here) to be a girl! <br /><br />Everything else about this movie is worthless and forgettable	the humor is high school level or less.<br /><br />2 stars for a good idea and a few good touching & relevant moments w/ Billy Crystal. Ignore the rest of Rabitt Test	it flunks big time!<br /><br />I can't believe Roddy McDowell signed on either! (END)"	0.0
"The first Matrix movie was lush with incredible character development	 witty dialog	 and action scenes that kept with the flow of the story. These elements -- coupled by incredible special effects of the day -- presented a magical ride that kept you in suspense the entire time. Enter Matrix Reloaded (and its sequel	 Revolutions). The problem here isn't the special effects or the fight sequences as some may argue; The brothers have taken well-developed characters from the first film and hollowed them out like rotten tree logs. The connection that was first established between viewers and on-screen characters in the first film is lost when you realize these are not the same characters from the first Matrix movie.<br /><br />To wit	 Morpheus was developed as a charismatic	 philosophical character with insight far exceeding anyone else in the movie	 but here in Reloaded -- we're presented by a different Morpheus who stands hard and hollow	 reduced to corny one-liners that contradict the character we saw develop in the first film. This character just didn't feel the same	 and this could also be said about the supporting characters in the movie.<br /><br />The removal of 'Tank' was also a disappointment. Tank's involvement in the first film was minimal at best	 but he played the role extremely well. In Reloaded	 we discover that Tank dies after the events in the first film	 and he is replaced by a Jar Jar Binks stunt double that couldn't act to save his live (think stale box of Kellogg's Corn Flakes). His performance left me chuckling throughout	 and most of his spoken dialog lacked timing. There was an overwhelming sense that he was either trying too hard to convey his emotions on-screen or the delivery in the script was off; in either case	 the experience was humorous! At times I felt embarrassed for the actor....<br /><br />Even Neo's Godly persona was suspect during most of the fighting sequences. The alleyway battle with the 200 Agent Smith clones was certainly exaggerated. One must wonder	 for a man so gifted as Neo -- that he would even waste his time engaging in such a fruitless	 frivolous battle when more pressing matters attend (especially when you consider his ability to fly or his ungodly ability to bend the Matrix; certainly Neo could have dispatched the clones much quicker	 and more efficiently). Again	 such acts lend themselves to a script hindered by consistency	 and scenes created as filler to keep us from feeling gypped. In jest	 our expectations of the characters created in the first film are discarded promptly. Sadly	 for those expecting more of the same -- you will certainly walk away feeling gravely disappointed.<br /><br />However	 if you take Reloaded as your standard	 run-of-the-mill action movie	 and forget the incredible story inconsistencies and the untwining of already-established character development from the first film	 you should walk away feeling quite pleased."	0.0
"There is a story (possibly apocryphal) about an exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the start of Twelve Monkeys. Gilliam (allegedly) produced a long list (think about the aircraft one from the Fifth Element) and handed it to Butch Bruce. It was entitled ""Things Bruce Willis Does When He Acts"". It ended with a simple message saying: ""please don't do any of the above in my movie"".<br /><br />There is a fact about this movie (definitely true). Gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing.<br /><br />I would contend that these two factors played a huge role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success that is The Twelve Monkeys.<br /><br />Visually	 the Twelve Monkeys is all that we have rightly come to expect from a Gilliam film. It is also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and general (but magnificent) strangeness. Gilliam delights in wrong-footing his audience. Although the ending of the Twelve Monkeys will surprise no one who has sat through the first real	 Gilliam borrows heavily from Kafka in the clockwork	 bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters towards their fate. It is this journey	 and the character developments they undergo	 which unsettles.<br /><br />I love Gilliam films (Brazil	 in particular). But they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness. He seems to have so many ideas	 and so much enthusiasm	 that his films almost invariably end up as a tangled mess (Brazil	 in particular). I still maintain that Brazil is Gilliam's tour de force	 but there's no denying that The Twelve Monkey's is a breath of fresh air in the tight-plotting department. Style	 substance and form seem to merge in a way not usually seen from the ex-Python.<br /><br />Whatever the truth of the rumour above	 Gilliam also manages to get a first rate (and very atypical) performance out of the bald one. Bruce is excellent in this film	 as are all the cast	 particularly a suitably bonkers - and very scary - Brad Pitt.<br /><br />It's been over a decade since this film was released. When I watched it again	 I realised that it hadn't really aged. I had changed	 of course. And this made me look at the film with fresh eyes. This seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that	 partly at least	 is about reflections in mirrors	 altered perspectives and the absurd one-way journey through time that we all make. A first rate film. 8/10."	1.0
"Routine suspense yarn about a sociopath (Dillon) who gives his sperm to a clinic of human reproduction and starts to harrass the lives of the woman (Antony) and his husband (Mancuso). Extremely predictable	 far-fetched and with undecided tone all the way. Don't lose your time with this one...make a baby instead!"	0.0
"After having seen ""Marrying Mafia""	 I'd nearly lost my faith in Korean movie business. But this one brought my faith back.<br /><br />Leading female character who is university student forced to teach the spoiled	 rich but charistmatic high school student guy. He is actually female character's age. Through some hilarious quarrells	 these two end up being great friends.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised that newcomer kwan sang woo did his job with excellency. He was such a revelation!! Actress Kim ha nul was also charming as usual.<br /><br />This movie tried hard to avoid any cliches that can be seen in typical romantic comedies. And it didn't show us any unnecessary nude	 sex scenes. It was brilliant	 lovely 	 fresh	 made me want to see it again.<br /><br />"	1.0
"An absolutely brilliant film! Jiri Trnka	 the master of puppet animation	 confronts totalitarianism in this	 his final	 film. It would be banned by the Communist Czechoslovakian government (at the time)	 despite taking the country's highest animation award.<br /><br />In this dark and entertaining short film	 an artist attempts to create a new pot for his favourite plant. He happily makes his creations while dreaming that his plant will grow to be a beautiful rose. All of a sudden	 he here's a knock at the door	 and in comes this giant omnipotent hand	 that tries to force the artist to make statues in it's likeness. The artist resists as best he can	 but he eventually becomes overwhelmed by the constant attempts	 by the hand	 to force him to conform. He becomes brainwashed; an intellectual zombie. At this point the hand attaches strings to the artist	 puts him in a cage	 and uses him to make hand statues. All the while glorifying the artist's work and awarding him with medals and honours.<br /><br />The artist's inner lust to be able to express himself freely is what helps him prevail over his indoctrination	 and enables him escape his prison	 whether it be literal or in his mind	 and return to his home where he now must live in constant fear of the wrath of the omnipotent hand. He shuts himself in	 thinking he is out of the reach of the almighty hand	 but in the process he puts his plant and pot up high	 hoping it is out of the reach of the hand	 and it ends up falling on his head	 killing him. The artist is inevitabally destroyed by his own creation. All because of the constant fear he had to live with once he escaped the hand's strings. Once dead	 the hand paints the artist as a great person	 a national hero. Unfortunately not in the circumstances or for the reasons that the artist would like to be remembered.<br /><br />Trnka's condemnation of Totalitarian society	 and their lack of right for free expression is dark	 damning and an amazingly animated. It is no wonder the government banned it as this is the sort of media that people admire	 and would perhaps even listen to. That was obviously not acceptable. An amazing example of an artists civil disobedience and the impact it can have. And still quite relevant today for many parts of the world	 from the US to the middle east. A must see and definite 10 out of 10! Talk about going out with a bang!"	1.0
"By the late forties the era of the screwball comedy was over	 as films were moving in a different direction	 comedically and otherwise. With television looming on the horizon	 Hollywood would soon be in for a very rough time. Where	 one wonders	 would movies have gone had television not come along	 or its arrival on the scene been delayed by five or ten years? Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House offers one particular way comedy might have developed.<br /><br />Ad man Jim Blandings	 along with his wife and two daughters	 are living in a nice but way too cramped New York City apartment	 as one day he gets the bright idea that it might be fun to realize his dream of building a house in the suburbs. So he buys some property in Connecticut and has one built to his precise specifications. Well	 almost. Had he known the trouble he was in for he might have changed his mind. Then again he might not have. You decide. On this frail premise a wonderful film results	 full of conflict between the middle class dream of owning one's own home and the the oftentimes unpleasant reality of acquiring one. Nothing comes easy in this life	 as Mr. Blandings learns; but one needn't be miserable just because things don't always go one's way. There is	 after all	 the long run. But	 Blandings asks himself every few minutes	 how long is long?<br /><br />This movie is a delight. It is not	 I suppose	 a masterpiece in the Capra-McCarey tradition	 but it is a worthy successor to their thirties pictures	 and may well have been a harbinger of things to come had the arrival of television not changed the cultural landscape so radically. There is real warmth in the picture	 and a good deal of (W.C.) Fieldsian hard-edged reality obtruding periodically	 but not so much as to leave a bad taste. The people in the film are all very smart and affluent	 but decidedly of the professional upper middle not the idle rich upper class.<br /><br />Lead players Cary Grant and Myrna Loy plays Mr. and Mrs. Blandings to perfection; while Melvyn Douglas is fine as their pragmatic lawyer friend	 who often has to bring up unpleasant topics	 such as how the real world works. There is	 too	 a wonderful sense of what for want of a better term one might call the romance of suburbia	 which was in its infancy in the immediate postwar years	 as one sees the woods and streams that drew people to the country in the first place. These people are most definitely fish out of water in the then still largely rural Connecticut. In a few short years things would change	 as the mad rush to suburbia would be in full gear	 destroying forever the pastoral innocence so many had yearned for in the small towns	 which soon would be connected by highways	 littered with bottles and cans	 their effluvia rivaling anything one would encounter in the city."	1.0
"Solino really moved me with its deeply drawn characters. While being a simple tale of rivalry between two brothers	 it was not simply about hate or jealousy. What I liked most about the movie was how I could identify with the feelings Gigi was going through especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in Italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into. To see this character who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating. Even at the end when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his father was so brave. And as in real life	 most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children. I could even identify with Giancarlo	 the brother	 who while being the more self assured and elder brother	 had so many insecurities. A really beautiful film that made me laugh and cry."	1.0
"This film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful men's wives.<br /><br />I thought ""The Walker"" would be thrilling and engaging	 but I was so wrong. The pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow	 that even after 40 minutes of the film nothing happens much. Seriously	 the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes. That's how slow it is.<br /><br />The fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes aggravates the boredom. It's almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion. Maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class? <br /><br />It's sad that ""The Walker"" becomes such a boring mess	 despite such a strong cast. Blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing."	0.0
"On the surface	 this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation	 that is how to become a true self by embracing the so-called 'dark' side of human nature. Thus	 we have the Darkling	 a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company (that is	 recognition) of men	 and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled	 more or less successfully. <br /><br />However	 if we dig a little deeper	 we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person: - in the opening scene	 the main character (male car mechanic fallen from grace)is collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter	 when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl. Lesson #1: Cars are persons embodied with immortal souls	 and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery. The wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished. - just after that	 another character (Rubin) buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a once-lost-now-found famous race-car and is warned by the salesman. Lesson #2: Just like any other person	 a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced. In addition	 there is the twist that Rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk	 but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of Rubin's own personal greed for more profit. Lesson #3: Thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only	 but always as an end in itself. - then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to Rubin and	 more importantly	 Rubin's car: The main character's assessment of the car's qualities is not just based on its outer appearance	 but also by a thorough look inside the engine room. Lesson #4: A car is not just to be judged by its looks	 it is what is inside that really counts. There is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind	 as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell Rubin a fake collector's car. This scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson #3. <br /><br />There are numerous other examples in the movie of the 'car=person'-theme	 and I am too tired now to bother citing all of them	 but the point remains (and I guess this is what I'm really trying to say) that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do - or	 if you're a car devotee."	0.0
"This film exhibits artful cinematic techniques wherein instead of landscape capturing the attention of the camera it is small details in how someone appears	 how the woman may be wearing a cocktail hat and wrapped in a sheet. How the husband may be wearing a hat and socks and shoes and his underwear and both seem so completely at ease and comfortable. How provocative the woman is posed is another feature of the tableau that the director chooses to let us know she is a free spirit sexually and aims to get the pleasure she seeks without flirting directly or with any particular sensitivity to what the man may be feeling. The relationship between the wife and husband is unique. It is an open one wherein she holds nothing back	 feels no particular shame for how she has behaved and wants to share these facts with him because her primary focus always is on the fact of their marriage. Nothing and no one can come between the two of them. Only the chances of fate can intervene---his imprisonment during the war and what follows after his return at long last. A very intriguing film which is totally absorbing."	1.0
"It's just such a joy to have watched this intriguing project. So refreshing and educating. Not only to a filmmaker	 who can learn what can be achieved in 5 minutes of screen time	 but also as audience	 who may not be so ready for so much love in such short time.<br /><br />20 short films about love in Paris are all unique	 but some of them	 as expected	 stand out. I thought the Tom Tykwer (Natalie Portman) segment was the best	 although the mimes made me smile inside just the same.<br /><br />I clicked on ""spoilers"" option for this review bus alas...what you read is a spoiler enough. Just watch it. Don't read what I write	 but watch the movie instead.<br /><br />And smile."	1.0
"That this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at Sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days.<br /><br />First of all	 there is such a thing as the art of cinematography. Just picking up a 16mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real movie.<br /><br />I guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didn't pick up someone's camcorder...<br /><br />Second	 indie films are supposed to be about real people. There's nothing real in this film. None of the characters come across as being even remotely human.<br /><br />What they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how ""cool and edgy"" he is.<br /><br />Sorry	 but this is not good writing	 or good directing.<br /><br />What is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to Sundance. Hard to believe this was one of the best films submitted...<br /><br />In any case	 it made me loose what was left of my respect for the Sundance brand."	0.0
"As it is generally known	anthology films don't fare very well with American audiences (I guess they prefer one standard plot line). New York	I Love You	 is the second phase of a series of anthology films dealing with cities & the people who live & love in them. The first was 'Paris	J'Taime'	 which I really enjoyed. The film was made up of several segments	each written and/or directed by a different director (most of which were French	but there is a very funny segment directed by Joel & Ethan Coen). Like 'Paris'	 this one is also an anthology	 directed by several different directors (Fatih Akin	Mira Nair	Natalie Portman	Shakher Kapur	etc.)	and also like 'Paris'deals with New Yorkers	and why they love the city they live in. It features a top notch cast	featuring the likes of Natalie Portman	Shia LaBeouf	Christina Ricci	Orlando Bloom	Ethan Hawki	and also features such seasoned veterans as James Caan	Cloris Leachman	Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. Some of the stories really fly	and others don't (although I suppose it will depend on individual tastes---I won't ruin it for anybody else by revealing which ones worked for me & which ones didn't). Word is that the next entry in the series will be Shanghai	 China (is Rome	Italy	Berlin	Germany or Athens	Greece out of the question?). Spoken mainly in English	but does have bits of Yiddish & Russian with English subtitles. Rated 'R'by the MPAA for strong language & sexual content"	1.0

"This movie was on the Romance channel	 and I thought it might be a goofy 80's movie that would be enjoyable on some level	 so my brother and I watched it. Boy did it suck. Boy gets crush on girl--correction	 his *dream*-girl (apparently there is a difference; and I'm surprised he realized she was his dream girl--he was smitten with her from over 30 feet away. I guess that just goes to show the power of dream-girls)	 boy ends up masquerading as a female to be near dream-girl (creative in the sense that it's a far-out plan	 but un-creative in the sense that there are probably better solutions one might think up)	 awkward situations ensue	 a match is made (all of which takes seems to take place around late afternoon--either the location was somehow responsible for this odd lighting	 or the actors had to wait until they got off of their day-jobs to come to the set; I suspect the latter). Very clumsily done	 very pathetic. It's almost never even amusing *accidentally*	 so there really is nothing to redeem it. Unless you're interested in seeing Chad Lowe's early days	 before he finally got his piece of the pie with his role as the HIV-positive gay guy on the series ""Life Goes On""	 or Gail O'Grady who was on NYPD Blue and probably got to stare at Dennis Franz's buttocks). But those are unlikely motives--I'd say ""systematic derangement of the senses"" would be a more justified purpose. I'm surprised I watched it all. I guess it's the kind of thing where	 halfway through	 you find yourself *still* watching due to some morbid	 self-flagellistic inner-issue	 and think you might as well finish it so you can tell your friends and family that you actually sat through such a horrible movie	 on the off-chance that it'll garner you some sympathy for the questionable state of your mental health.

"This could have been a rather entertaining film	 but instead it ranks with other duds like Leeches and Rest In Pieces at the bottom of the cinematic food chain. Had they played this flick tongue-in-cheek	 it could have been a very entertaining film	 like Re-Animator or Dead ALive	 but Juan Piquor Simon plays it tongue-in-cheek in spots but straight more often.<br /><br />The premise of this film is a small community that is besieged by mutated slugs. There is an abandoned toxic waste dump near a sewer line that mutates the slugs into aggressive	 meat-eating monsters - albeit monsters that move slowly and can be squished under your boot. Health Inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only people that seem willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy. The climax is a laugh riot - unintentional at that - which makes you scratch your head as to how stupid (actors and screenwriter) the scenario of destroying the slugs is.<br /><br />STORY: $$ (No new ground charted here. Simon seems to play the gore elements tongue-in-cheek but the dialogue is straight. Had Simon worked with a clever script - one with plenty of one-liners and eccentric characters	 this could have been a cult film).<br /><br />VIOLENCE: $$$ (You won't be letdown here. We get plenty of exploding chest cavity scenes as well as a grand head explosion in the middle of a fine Italian restaurant. The blood and guts	 that many horror film watchers enjoy	 is in full swing here. You also get corpses of people who have been picked clean by the slugs and plenty of slug smashing scenes).<br /><br />ACTING: $ (Wow! Michael Garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker and he delivers his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how preposterous this film-making endeavor is. Kim Terry	 as his wife	 does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the hold-your-face-while-you-scream bit. The ""teenagers"" were all horrible actors - no exceptions. Man	 this film could have used Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs!) <br /><br />NUDITY: $$ (Two teens get naughty in bed before they get dispatched - in a poorly done scene - by a horde of slugs that crawled into the girl's bedroom. Both male and female nudity here)."	0.0
"I like Fulci films	 i really do and not in some boring ironic way either but i recognise that they appear hopelessly inept and garbled to lots of people.<br /><br />Conquest is where Fulci tries his hand at the epic fantasy genre and doesn't really succeed. Structurally	 it's like most Fulci films you've seen. Some stuff happens	 some more stuff happens and occasionally one scene might be tangentially related to another. Really it's like Conan with no sets	 no script	 no real actors (yes	 Arnold Scharzenfartz is hardly an actor either)	 no budget	 stupid looking dog soldiers and a bunch of gore.<br /><br />This one was a hard one to get through and i could've lived without the inch of vaseline smeared on the camera to give it that Hair Metal music video look."	0.0
"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The story was boring	 the dialogue was atrocious and the acting hammy. I'm not sure if this movie was the result of a film school homework project	 but it certainly played like one.

"Feature of early 21 century cinema of lets pit different evil creatures and bad guys against each other. We haven't seen stuff like this since Godzilla v King Kong and the like. Always sounds great on paper when you're splicing up and in a haze of the good stuff you have an inspired idea and see the whole playing out before you like Beethoven's symphonies. Then you come to writing it. Great ideas like all vampires are female. Ergo hot	 seductive deadly but in a way I want to perish sort of way. And all zombies are men. well thats what men are like to a woman just after shes been dumped or cheated on right? So it all looks good up to actually making it. Then the rot starts to set in. Mosters have fight. Nothing much happens. Another fight. Philosophical noodling and cods wallop. Eureka we've found how to win. Big fight again and the End. Sounds great doesn't it? If it was made an indie company it would be great. But this is Hollywood with the eye on the bucks: gloss instead of what the fans want. It all could have been gore soaked beautiful."	0.0
"While filming an 80's horror movie called 'Hot Blooded'	 the director is brutally murdered and the leading lady is scarred as she survives the attack and manages to kill murderer. After all of this	 the production is abandoned and the stock reels are left to gather dust. So a group of filmmakers decide to pick up where the film left off even though they're warned by people to keep away from the film	 as the last person who was interested in the flick turned up dead in the cinema while watching the film. From this it's labelled as a cursed production. Not taking these warnings seriously the crew goes ahead with the production and they get the original star of the movie to return from Hollywood to reprise her role	 but not as the daughter but the mother. But again the murders start occurring with the cast and crew getting butchered by an unknown figure dressed up as the film's killer.<br /><br />Look what 'Scream' started! Hey	 I enjoy those films	 but mostly everything else that followed on afterwards were annoying and pointless excuses. During this stage the sub-genre came back with vengeance	 but it wasn't much of a good thing as they were mostly unsuccessful and unoriginal attempts	 where they followed the derivative pattern of the Scream franchise. 'Cut' which is an independent Australian take on the textbook slasher genre is purely shonky garbage that lacks basically everything and shamelessly knocks off every other slasher flick. But you know what	 I found it a cheesy delight. Yeah	 It's gawd awful and highly forgettable	 but it's a bit of ala good cheap fun while it lasted. Although I did hate it when I originally came across it	 but the second time around I knew what I was getting myself into and it worked better for it. It was just like helping myself to a nice slice cheesecake again	 but this time it wasn't so sweet.<br /><br />The film came out around the same time as 'Scream 3' and 'Urban Legends: The Final Cut' did	 which all three follow the same structure of using a movie within a movie. 'Scream 3' is obviously the strongest of the three	 but I would actually watch this trash over Urban Legends: The Final Cut. Though	 it did seem more of a throwback to the 80's slashers than that of one of Scream's bastard offspring. Pretty much the film is given b-grade treatment and that shows up in the script and performances. The dialog is truly unimaginative and hardly comes up with any surprises and suspense. While	 the performances are pure mockery and Molly Ringwald takes the crown for it. She plays the wash-up actress returning to finish the cursed flick and I had good fun with her laughably ridiculous send-up performance. She provides the bite here and nails it down perfectly. The rest were mostly recognizable Australian TV stars (that's if you're an Australian) with a ravishing Jessica Napier leading the cast with the likes of Stephen Curry and Frank Roberts. Also pop singer (and supposed actress) Kylie Minogue makes a cameo appearance in the opening just to be hacked up! Nice. These teens mostly followed the formula of horny and dim-witted kids that have nothing better to do but to be killed. Sometimes it feels like they just waiting in queue	 because they have no real substance to be there.<br /><br />The plot starts off rather interestingly	 then heads into a mystery phase where red herrings pop up	 but then it makes a sudden u-turn where it becomes a somewhat satire on the horror genre. Simply it's rather choppy and when it comes to the explanation for all of this madness I was kind of left thinking oh my. This when it tries to twist back onto itself in a clever manner	 but sadly it falls along way. But don't you just love an opening ending. Also it sports some pop culture references and a self referential	 tongue-in-cheek approach. Predictability makes its way in rather early and the jokes can become over-stated at times	 but it knows that by poking fun at itself quite a bit. The atmosphere looses a bit of edge because of the humour taking away the bleakness	 but still the isolated grand old mansion where they are filming has some neat touches that added 'some' spookiness. The cinema scene is done rather nicely too.<br /><br />Now	 now we know we want gore and nudity when watching this type of flick	 but sadly there's no nudity to be found and the gore is pretty standard	 if lacking but it's more then decent for such low-budget flick. There are one or two creative deaths	 but the rest are systematic. The killer wasn't bad but when he spoke it kind of hurt it I thought	 well the smart-ass attitude didn't sit well with me. Another notes of the production which were dire ranged from the cut-away editing	 out-of-place soundtrack and Kimble Rendall's direction lacked execution and was pretty careless	 but these contributing factors pull together to add some sort of sheer entertainment to all of this badness.<br /><br />The imagination matches the budget that's for sure	 but heck this lousy slasher wasn't trying to be anything else. Pure schlock that's slightly amusing!"	0.0
"I am at a distinct disadvantage here. I have not seen the first two movies in this series	 although I have seen a lot of Larry Cohen films. Fans of the series seem to think this is a good film. Judging it on it's own	 it was pretty boring.<br /><br />You never get a real good look at the maniac cop's (Robert Z'Dar) face	 but what I did see was pretty grim. The death scenes seem to be staged to eat up the most film	 not to give any thrills. Maybe if I saw the NC-17 Director's Cut	 I may be more impressed.<br /><br />The ending with the car chase with Z'Dar	 Caitlin Dulany	 and Robert Davi was pretty intense. best part of the movie."	0.0
"It's funny	 when you stop and think about it: fright film fans tend to a deep and abiding affection toward those who scare the daylights out of them. THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE may give us nightmares	 but who among us (the Faithful) didn't feel a very real twinge of love for Gunnar Hansen in BRUTAL MASSACRE- or for Ken Foree	 forever and ever the resolute hero of the original DAWN OF THE DEAD? His cameo in the remake made me want to stand up and cheer (as did Tom Savini's cameo); I kid you not. And Brian Halloran and... Well	 you get my drift (if not	 just stand downwind...). These are some of the Heroes of Horror. To see this many of them gathered together in a single movie is almost unheard of (at least to this degree	 to my knowledge). If only the writer(s) had been up to such a monumental task. Maybe someone else	 somewhere along the line	 will try again. As long as it's not another half-hearted effort (like BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD	 for instance)."	0.0

It's kind of like a traffic accident	 though	 I couldn't seem to turn it off!

"You talking' to Me? (1987) is a pretty bad movie starring some dude who I have never seen before or since starring as a guy from the neighborhood who tries to become an actor.

"Störtebeker is truly one of the worst TV mini-series ever made on this planet.<br /><br />The acting is unbearable and the historic background is mostly nonsense: Just two examples: Visby was shown as a village of three houses. Instead	 it was a major city at this time	 it's best days already passed by. Secondly	 Hamburg would have never been the city taking care of pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg had no access to the Baltic Sea	 the major town at that time was Lübeck.<br /><br />But worse than all that: The directing! How can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this? Impossible! There was not a single believable scene it	 the fights were ridiculous and I could not suppress laughter at most stern scenes.<br /><br />I can't understand at all how a major television station could be so incompetent."	0.0
"The Farrelly brothers	 Bobby and Peter	 are at it again. With ""Fever Pitch"" the creators of other films that have dealt with a lot of gross themes	 abandon that tactic when they decided to bring Nick Hornby's film to the screen	 something that it would have been hard to do. The novel	 of the same title	 dealt with a man's obsession with soccer	 since it is set in England	 where that sport consumes most of British sports fans. It's to the credit of the writing team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandell	 to transform the book into a language that would appeal to most Americans	 when they make their hero	 a Boston Red Sox fan.<br /><br />""Fever Pitch"" is a film that presents an obsessive fan	 Ben Wrightly	 whose life revolves into the Red Sox season	 and who is an eighth grade teacher with uncanny ways for involving his students into the subject he tries to teach them. When Ben takes four of his best pupils for a tour of a local firm	 he meets	 and falls hopelessly in love with the brainy Lindsey Meeks	 a young woman who is going places	 but at thirty	 has no life of her own.<br /><br />The story follows the two lovers through the ritual of attending the Red Sox	 at home games	 in Fenway Park. This team's fans are probably the most loyal people in the world	 having stuck with a team that does marvelous things but	 until 2004	 never won a World Series. In fact	 the ending	 from what we heard	 had to be changed because that was the year in which they finally won the event that had eluded them for eighty six years! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are perfect as the couple at the center of the film. Ms. Barrymore is a natural who always surprises in her appearances in front of the camera. Jimmy Fallon	 a popular television comedian	 turned movie actor	 has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in ""Taxi""	 in our humble opinion.<br /><br />The Farrelly brothers film will satisfy their fans as well as baseball fans with this baseball tale."	1.0
"Certainly not horrible	 but definitely not good.<br /><br />Cry	 The Beloved Country (1995) was directed by Darrell Roodt and written for the screen by Ronald Harwood (Adapted from the 1946 novel by Alan Paton). Starring James Earl Jones and Richard Harris.<br /><br />The film is about pre-Apartheid South Africa	 and the stories of a black man and a white man intertwining. The pious but naive preacher Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) receives a letter from Johannesburg saying that he must come immediately; he later finds that his son has killed a man. The rich farmer/landowner James Jarvis (Richard Harris) finds that his son	 a fighter for black rights	 was the one killed by Kumalo's son. In this they connect.<br /><br />I cannot compare it to the 1951 film of the same name	 for I have not seen it. Or the 1974 musical titled Lost in the Stars for I have also not seen it; both look better than this one. But Cry Freedom	 on the other hand	 I have seen; it has a much more urgent air to it	 like it actually is trying to say something where the film Cry	 The Beloved Country seems to have no idea where it is going. Very ""Wishy-washy"". I refuse to compare the film to the novel (except that I did enjoy the novel more than I enjoyed the film) because novels and films are two extremely different media and there is no point in trying to transfer directly one to the other or compare them via the same means.<br /><br />Frankly	 this movie blew. Well	 I guess it wasn't that bad	 --Five-out-of-ten	 -- but it wasn't that good either. Both of the leads	 both very capable actors pull some of the most wooden performances I have seen with some of the most awkward dialogue in film history (but that can be blamed on he screenwriter	 Ronald Harwood	 who is also oddly off is game with this film	 having also written the sublime The Pianist	 and Being Julia). Among other things the point and themes of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to film for the third time; there is little	 if any	 tension with any moment of the film	 racially or suspensefully. The music doesn't help. The painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this dulling down of the film. One upside is the cinematography	 with many rather good or great shots	 but unfortunately	 this does not help the film too much.<br /><br />The last	 striking words of Alan Paton's novel are displayed in the last moments of the film. It is too bad that they seem to be so disconnected from the film that was just shown. I don't know what Nelson Mandela might have seen in this film.<br /><br />Thanks for your time."	0.0
"This is shallow hedonism and/or social commentary wrapped in a tragic tale about a jealous young woman's scheme to drive apart her father and his fiancée. Is it incest or just a view through the eyes of a daughter with an Electra complex? Who cares? All of the characters	 except for Anne (Deborah Kerr) are vacuous and vile. Seberg is poor (I agree with the ""boys with breasts"" comment of an earlier review). The plot plodded. This predictable material was sufficient for about 30 minutes of film that unfortunately was stretched over an hour and a half! If you want to see great gowns and jewels on the Riviera	 I recommend ""To Catch a Thief"" - in which you will get the added bonuses of an entertaining story and likable characters. <br /><br />I like for films to entertain me. I personally don't really care where a film is set. Whatever the time or place	 I want a good story - comedy or drama. I also want to see some enjoyable characters. It doesn't hurt if I can relate to them. Poor Deborah Kerr gives a typically good performance	 and so does David Niven in a despicable role.<br /><br />The ""2"" rating is solely for Kerr and Niven	 and for the cinematography - the rich color scenes and the murky	 foreboding black and white scenes. Unfortunately	 all the great cinematography in the world cannot salvage a poor story with un-enjoyable characters. A sow's ear is still a sow's ear. Consequently watching this mess was a serious waste of my time."	0.0
"Phantom of the Mall is a film that fits best in the ""easily forgotten"" category. It's a pretty lousy variant on the famous story by Gaston Leroux	 the Phantom of the Opera. Not a bad idea to itself	 but the plot and production of this movie are way to weak to bring a decent homage to that story. On the bright side	 Gaston Leroux doesn't has to turn over in his grave just yet. It could have been a lot worse. <br /><br />Phantom of the Mall has too many useless flashbacks in it and way too many boring sequences to make it memorable. Also	 the scriptwriters wanted to give too much draught to the story than necessary. And even though there's a lot of mystery getting build up about the character of Eric ... the basic plot is ordinary and déjà-vu. ***SPOILERS*** It's about a young couple that brutally gets torn apart because the boy gets killed in a fire. That fire was set to his house because he and his parents refused to sell their home in order to make room for a huge mall to be build. The boy survived the fire and he has hidden himself in the mall to avenge himself. Meanwhile he guards his girl who now works in the mall and tries to forget her loss ****END SPOILERS*** This pretty simple - but rather effective - plot gets thickened by lots of pointless elements and annoying conspiracy theories. While it should just be an entertaining horror movie	 it desperately tries to be an intelligent thriller...and that's not what the fans look for. There are a few innovative killings but they're not satisfying enough for people who want to see a relaxing horror movie. And besides	 Phantom of the Mall could have used at least a bit of humor!! This entire production - the cast included - takes itself way too serious. <br /><br />I'll try to finish with a few positive aspects...Like for example	 it stars Ken Foree !! Die-hard horror fans will certainly recognize him as Peter for Dawn of the Dead! That's like the horror milestone that yet has to find an equal. Even though his role in this movie is limited and even completely unnecessary...it was good to see him again. TV-movie fans will also recognize Morgan Fairchild as the mayor	 she's a fine actress and an elegant lady. Pauly Shore is also in this but I can't stand him...so my opinion about him may be a bit biased. And finally	 a bit of praise for the leading actress named Kari Whitman. She's an extremely beautiful girl and she does have a bit of talent...too bad she never made it to the top. Actually	 this movie is her biggest achievement and that says enough about her career..."	0.0
"I rented this movie	 thinking it looked like a wonderfully delightful historical piece. What I got was a piece of pure garbage. This movie was confusing in most spots	 choppy in almost every spot and dreadful in all spots. Mira Sorvino's portrayal of a queen playing a young male scholar was depressing at best. Ben Kingsley should have been stripped of his knighthood for even considering this film as one of his projects. Fiona Shaw should definitely stick to playing Petunia Dursley; at least the Harry Potter movies are more entertaining than this thing they call a play within a movie.<br /><br />The cinematography looks like some college kid took a class in Cinematography 101 and failed miserably. Almost every scene in the movie is chopped up for some sort of effect; the end result of course being the cheesiest bit of editing I've ever seen. Jay Rodan was almost good as Agis; too bad he had such a bad script to work with. Rachael Stirling gives her best effort as the almost gullible lady in waiting. In the end	 I really wish Blockbuster Video gave refunds. I'm so glad I didn't spend 10 bucks watching this fiasco in the theater. If they've been performing this Marivaux play since the 18th century	 it makes me wonder how many people over the ages have had their best naps during this work. If I had been there	 they wouldn't have hear the play over the snoring. Thank goodness for the modern convenience of DVD players; you can skip past the boring or awful scenes. Guess that means I only watched the beginning and the end!"	0.0
"An unassuming	 subtle and lean film	 ""The Man in the White Suit"" is yet another breath of fresh air in filmic format from Ealing studios. While I suspect some modern viewers may initially find it obscure	 I doubt many would fail to be charmed by the expert way the plot	 the themes and characters are languidly relayed during the film's course.<br /><br />The genuinely great Alec Guinness gives another fine characterization in a film perhaps not as obviously virtuoso as Ealing's inspired ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" from 1949. This time	 he merely plays one character rather than eight	 but as the unworldly inventor and scientist Sidney Stratton	 he always finds the correct tone and expression. Along with Guinness' subtle	 expressive performance	 the rest of the cast are effective. Of the main players	 Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger do stand out. Thesiger is compellingly absurd as the crippled but influential business grandee	 while Parker is dependable as the ineffectual yet pivotal mill owner and father. Father	 that is	 of Joan Greenwood	 the deftly delectable comic actress	 who is at her insurmountable peak in this film. Resplendent and seductive of aspect and diction	 she is quite sublime in this film	 a fine contrast with the similarly unusual	 but more maladroit Guinness. The scene where she seemingly tries to tempt him is played so adeptly by the pair that it is both deeply poignant and amusing...<br /><br />The themes are handled very effectively	 with no easy morals drawn. The complexities of the relationships between science	 business and the workforce are insightfully and enjoyably examined. Expertly helmed by Alexander Mackendrick	 this film is technically adept in all areas; evocative photography	 fitting sound effects and music and a wistful script	 all quietly impress. A thoroughly satisfying film	 with Guinness and Greenwood magnificent.<br /><br />Rating:- **** 1/2/*****"	1.0

"""The College Girl Murders"" is my first acquaintance with the writing work of Edgar Wallace  and generally my first real acquaintance with ""Krimi"" films in general  and I can say that I'm moderately impressed. This stuff is really entertaining	 although I never would have expected it to be so goofy! The film has an exhilarating and nicely convoluted plot	 with a healthy dose of humor	 flamboyant twists and pretty inventive killings. There's some James Bond type of evil mastermind  who always sits in the shadow and in front of a large monitor - recruiting prisoners to kill certain girls at a specific college with a new type of poison. There's also a villainous monk with a whip	 dressed like a communist KKK member	 getting rid of the leftover characters	 like overly curious teachers and such	 as well as a kooky police commissioner who persists on solving the case with a psychological approach. Seriously	 if I had known sooner that these Krimi films were so colorful and crazy	 I would have purchased a whole collection of them already. The pretzel plot actually raises more questions than it answers in the end	 and the overload of comical gimmicks on the account of Scotland Yard Inspector Higgins are sometimes a bit much to swallow	 but I don't care because it was sublime entertainment. Even the funky 60's soundtrack remained stuck in my head for a long time. It's like a variant on the Italian Giallo	 but with slapstick elements."	1.0
"this movie only gets a second star because i work downtown and liked seeing it destroyed. the effects were pretty good- i hear it was the most expensive Korean film ever made. being the most expensive and still absolutely horrid makes it a massive waste of money. i rented it so i won't complain too much about what i paid	 but it was a couple hours that i'll never get back. plot holes abound. terrible acting all across the board. i do not recommend giving up the time to watch this movie	 life is too short. if your friends want to watch this	 run away. i can't stress enough how bad this film was. <br /><br />where the hell did the second dragon come from? why didn't he show up sooner? how did they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs just 500 years ago?"	0.0

"A vastly underrated black comedy	 the finest in a series of grand guignol movies to follow 'Baby Jane'. Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young convicted murderers (a nod to 'Compulsion') who run away to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for would-be movie tots	 a bunch of hilariously untalented kids attended by awful stage moms. Debbie	 in her blonde wig ('I'm a Harlow	 you're more a Marion Davies' she tells Winters) leads the tots at their concert and wins a rich dad	 Weaver. She also does a deliciously funny tango and	 over all	 gives an outstanding performance	 unlike anything she'd done before. The atmosphere is a fine mix of comic and eerie. It looks wonderful with great period detail (30's). Lots of lovely swipes at Hollywood and the terrifying movie tot. Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as the drama coach: 'Hamilton Starr'	 he purrs	 'two r's but prophetic nonetheless'. See it and love it."	1.0
"This movie features a gorgeous brunette named Danielle Petty. She has stunning green eyes	 and is in the first few scenes and the last scene. She is the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive. She may not have a future as an actress	 because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers.<br /><br />The movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it. It is not a good horror film	 or a good fake journalistic report	 or remotely well done. There is no skill apparent in it's production. It is like a bad student film. The story's horrific elements do not make you sick	 it is the fact that it is so poorly done that makes you sick. I would give this movie ZERO stars if I could."	0.0
"Everything was better in past days. Even children's television. And Fraggle Rock proves my point quite easily. At the time of writing this comment I am fourteen years old but even in my teen years I can't resist the charm of Fraggle Rock. For those of you that have indeed been living under a rock (haha!)	 Fraggle Rock is about a horde of playful and goofy creatures called Fraggles who live-amazingly-in a rock. But they're not the only creatures. The rock is inhabited with many other species like the hardworking Doozers and countless living plants. Outside the rock on one side live inventor-scientist Doc and his dog Sprocket (who later befriends Gobo Fraggle)	 on the other side a family of Gorgs-supposed rulers of the Universe. The five main Fraggles Gobo (fearless leader)	 Mokey (arty and peaceful)	 Wembley (indecisive and a friend to Gobo)	 Boober (a pessimistic domestic god) and Red (loves anything to do with sport and general feistyness)get caught up in some strange situations each episode while at the same time sing and dance their cares away.<br /><br />Fraggle Rock is definitely a family show-the plots may have intricate details that infants may not follow well	 but the song-and-dance routines will hold their attention. The characters are strong and likable	 their conflicts believable and their adventures thrilling. The Gorgs are frightening	 Doc and Sprocket enlightening	 Uncle Travelling Matt hilarious (the postcard segments are very 80s!) and the final episode	 Change of Address	 genuinely touching. Let's go down to Fraggle Rock again!"	1.0
"Mad Magazine may have a lot of crazy people working for it...but obviously someone there had some common sense when the powers-that-be disowned this waste of celluloid...the editing is el crapo	 the plot is incredibly thin and stupid...and the only reason it gets a two out of ten is that Stacy Nelkin takes off some of her clothes and we get a nice chest shot...I never thought I would feel sorry for Ralph Macchio making the decision to be in this thing	 but I do...and I REALLY feel bad for Ron Leibman and Tom Poston	 gifted actors who never should have shown up in this piece of...film...at least Mr. Leibman had the cajones to refuse to have his name put anywhere on the movie...and he comes out ahead...there are actually copies of this thing with Mad's beginning sequence still on it...if you can locate one	 grab it cuz it is probably worth something...it's the only thing about this movie that's worth anything...and a note to the folks at IMDb.com...there is no way to spoil this movie for anyone...the makers spoiled it by themselves..."	0.0
"Eric Rohmer's 'The Lady and the Duke' is based on the journals of an English aristocrat who lived through the French revolution. But it's a stilted affair	 with its strange	 painted backdrops and mannered conversational tone. Most notably	 this portrait of age of terror takes place almost entirely at one remove from the real action; one sees very little of ordinary people in this movie	 and little of the chaos	 poverty and terror that unfolded away from the drawing rooms of the persecuted	 but spoilt	 aristocratic classes. The result is frequently dull	 and ultimately unenlightening about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction; it's a disappointing film from an acclaimed director."	0.0
"L'Hypothèse du tableau volé/The Hypothesis of the Stolen Painting (1979) begins in the courtyard of an old	 three-story Parisian apartment building. Inside	 we meet The Collector	 an elderly man who has apparently devoted his life to the study of the six known existing paints of an obscure Impressionist-era painter	 Tonnerre. A narrator recites various epigrams about art and painting	 and then engages in a dialogue with The Collector	 who describes the paintings to us	 shows them to us	 tells us a little bit about the painter and the scandal that brought him down	 and then tells us he's going to show us something....<br /><br />As he walks through a doorway	 we enter another world	 or worlds	 or perhaps to stretch to the limits	 other possible worlds. The Collector shows us through his apparently limitless house	 including a large yard full of trees with a hill; within these confines are the 6 paintings come to life	 or half-way to life as he walks us through various tableaux and describes to us the possible meanings of each painting	 of the work as a whole	 of a whole secret history behind the paintings	 the scandal	 the people in the paintings	 the novel that may have inspired the paintings. And so on	 and so on. Every room	 every description	 leads us deeper into a labyrinth	 and all the while The Collector and The Narrator engage in their separate monologues	 very occasionally verging into dialogue	 but mostly staying separate and different.<br /><br />I watched this a second time	 so bizarre and powerful and indescribable it was	 and so challenging to think or write about. If I have a guess as to what it all adds up to	 it would be a sly satire of the whole nature of artistic interpretation. An indicator might be found in two of the most amusing and inexplicable scenes are those in which The Collector poses some sexless plastic figurines -- in the second of them	 he also looks at photos taken of the figurines that mirror the poses in the paintings -- then he strides through his collection	 which is now partially composed of life-size versions of the figures. If we think too much about it and don't just enjoy it	 it all becomes just faceless plastic....<br /><br />Whether I've come to any definite conclusions about ""L'Hypothèse du tableau volé""	 or not	 I can say definitely that outside of the early (and contemporaneous) works of Peter Greenaway like ""A Walk Through H""	 I've rarely been so enthralled by something so deep	 so serious	 so dense....and at heart	 so mischievous and fun."	1.0
"I spotted in the guide to films list for the Santa Barbara Film Festival	 where I went when I was in Hollywood	 that this film was in screening. Basically there is an election for the new chairman of the Hong Kong Triads Wo Sing Society coming up	 so you can imagine how much violence that is going to occur during this. The struggle is between ""candidates"" Lam Lok (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) for control of the oldest and most powerful Triad parts of the society. Also starring Louis Koo as Jimmy Lee	 Nick Cheung as Jet	 Cheung Siu Fai as Mr. So	 Lam Suet as Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as Kun. There are some good realistic corruption themes and moments	 just about enough action	 apart from maybe when the cops get involved	 but a sequel followed	 so it's a pretty worthwhile crime drama thriller. Very good!"	1.0
"Shot on an impossible schedule and no budget to speak of	 the movie turned out a lot better than you would expect	 certainly much more true to the Peter O'Donnell books and comic strip than the previous two films. You can read the strip currently in the reprints from Titan Books	 or in Comics Revue monthly. It is one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time. The movie isn't great	 but unlike most low budget films it makes the most of what its got	 and it holds your interest. On the DVD extras	 the interview with Quentin Tarentino	 who is obviously stoned	 is a gas. Some people have faulted Tarentino for associating his name with the film	 but without him it would never have been made. He is a Modesty Blaise fan	 and picked a good writer and director. All things considered	 worth 8 stars."	1.0
"This movie is a waste of time and money. Throughout the entire hour and a half	 I continued to wait for it to get better and it never did. It was slow moving	 the plot jumped around	 it wasn't scary or interesting	 and really never amounted to anything. The credits during the introduction were long and drawn out	 which was basically like the rest of the movie (long and drawn out). Numerous parts of the plot made no sense. Several times during the movie I had thought that maybe I had ""zoned out"" because the incongruity of the plot	 however	 my companion had the same issue and assured me I did not ""zone out"" from boredom	 but it was indeed the movie. I've actually never posted on here about a movie before and have been actively looking up movies on IMDb for numerous years. So the fact that I'm actually taking the time to write something should speak volumes of how bad this movie is and that you should not waste your time or money on it."	0.0
"I was in such high hopes of seeing an adaptation of a classic story like the Arabian Nights. Instead i was disappointed in a film that failed to keep my attention from the very beginning	 even though i tried watching it twice!! <br /><br />It was a bonus that Caradine was in this movie but it didn't amount to much as the actors lacked likability. For something a little similar Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras is much better for action	 comic moments and overall enjoyability.<br /><br />OK	 so Son of the Dragon has many possible fans out there	 but if your looking for something to wow about in terms of martial arts and plot line you wont get it. If you just want the kids to settle down on a Sunday afternoon then maybe this it for you along with the 3 ninjas."	0.0
"The Intruder (L'Intrus)	 a film directed by French director Clair Denis	 is the liberation of film. It follows its own spirit across time	 space	 and character. There may be a plot	 but what I understood of that I picked up from the description on the Netflix DVD sleeve. Honestly	 it's probably better to know nothing about the film before watching it	 because then the viewer can set aside any and all expectations. The film demands that the viewer think	 but also taunts the fact that he or she will not gain full understanding.<br /><br />The human heart is the film's enigma. Every image questions its role	 its nature	 and its form. The heart is the intruder	 that of the viewer and that of Louis. Louis' character is played by Michel Subor with the peace and mystery required by such a character. Honestly	 anyone could've played Louis' character	 if he or she possessed a wandering	 willing	 and comfortable heart. Yet Subor is the one featured here; he becomes the film	 his identity is inseparable from it. Many of the film's images lingering in my mind revolve around his expressions	 vocal but mainly physical.<br /><br />The Intruder is poetic in its ability to capture the stillness and fullness of movement	 but more fluid than any literature in the shape it refuses to take. ""Surrealistic"" has been a term used in describing this film	 but perhaps ""quasirealistic"" is a more adequate term. Nothing in the film exists outside of the possibilities of reality; the simple omnipresent score confirms that by imagining in music the connection between heartbeat and dim light.<br /><br />Watch the trailer a few times if you're attracted to visual imagery; see the film to see the consequences of the combination of verse and a grasping for freedom."	1.0
"This is one of the worst-written movies I've ever had to sit through.<br /><br />The story's nothing new -- but it's a cartoon	 so who cares	 as long as it's pretty and fun? <br /><br />I'm not going to go as deep as the characterisations	 or I'll be here all day (except to say that there aren't any; the characters change personality whenever it's convenient to the plot)	 but whoever wrote the script and visual direction should be forbidden access to so much as pencil and paper. Thumbs down? I'd vote to cut their thumbs off.<br /><br />""Narrow in on an object/prop. Cut back to character close-up. Character gives a knowing look	 which the audience will not even remotely understand. Repeat that several times	 with different objects/props.""<br /><br />""Make the characters pay no attention at all the huge lumps of rock are floating around	 crashing into each other	 generally raining destruction all over	 and which could kill them all at any moment -- but make them stop and gasp in fear when they see a harmless-looking	 almost pastoral green rock in the distance."" <br /><br />The whole thing is a long succession of events	 actions	 and behaviour that are only there for the convenience of the writer	 to save him having to think or make any effort at all to write the story properly.<br /><br />This is the Plan 9 of CG cartoons	 except that it doesn't have Ed Wood groan factor to make it fun to watch.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favour: spend your cartoon budget on Pixar movies."	0.0
As an old white housewife I can still appreciate that Laurence Fishburne is one of our finest actors. anyone who appreciates his work like in Deep Cover might enjoy watching the incredible acting range of this actor. Since I think this is his directorial debut it might prove even more interesting. All of the acting is quite good. If you can't take lower Manhattan junky worlds or the reality of crime life (not glorified action shoot-em ups) then this is not a film you would enjoy. It is Mr. Fishburne's usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships. I would love to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins go at each other some day in a movie.	1.0
"Just finished watching this movie for maybe the 7th or 8th time	 picked it up one night previously viewed at Blockbuster and absolutely loved it	 I've shown it to 4 people so far and they have enjoyed it as well. Avoid of all the Hollywood glamour	 special effects and stress on the ""shock factor""	 this independent film by Paul F. Ryan hits the nail on the head in dealing with the after affects of traumatic situations. Taking place after a high school shooting	 two characters Alicia (Busy Philipps) and Deanna (Erika Christensen) form an unlikely bond. Alicia	 the girl with the stone heart	 the Goth who has a pessimistic attitude to life assists Deanna to overcome the issues of life and death and living in the aftermath. Meanwhile Deanna attempts to help Alicia to see some of the softness and light in the world again. Not stressing on the shocking event of the shooting	 but on the interpersonal relationships amongst those who survived it sets this movie apart. Despite its low-budget and short filming time	 this movie is far from cheesy. Ryan pays respect to a situation he has never endured and attempts to delve into the human psyche. With an amazing up and coming actress	 Philipps	 adds the necessary dramatics to the dialogue and overall feel for the film and Christensen helps to balance out the ""doom and gloom"" feeling this movie may have. Overall	 I recommend this movie and if you enjoy the topic of school aggression and violence and learning more about it	 I also suggest the documentary ""It's a Girls World"" put out by CBC in 2004	 which deals with the topic of social bullying	 comparing and contrasting two groups of girls one in Montreal	 Quebec and the other in Victoria	 British Columbia	 the group of friends and acquaintances of Dawn Marie Wellesley a 14 year old girl who killed herself after being brutally bullied."	1.0
"The show is about two sisters living together. Holly being the younger one has some teenage problems on the other hand her sister Val has job	boy friend	fiancé problems like most of the women on the planet. They try to support each other they make mistakes sometimes but they don't give up and continue. And the show is also about friendship. The priorities in life. I loved this show so much. It is funny and the actors are so good. I am really sad that the show is over. I still watch the reruns time to time:) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth may be new to comedy but she plays really well. She is one of the actresses i like watching. I like Vince and Holly's relationship they are very natural. Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh each time he shows up. With Tina Holly found a real friend and i really like them hanging out. Lauren character is so funny and she is a natural talent. I would like to see her more. This show really takes you in and makes you laugh. I wish the show hasn't been over."	1.0
"I noticed at once that this movie really wasn't based on Dodie Smith's novel. In any case	 it was a nice idea that Pongo and Perdita's son now had his own puppies. The cutest of the Dalmatians was	 of course	 little Snowball who was completely spotless till the very end of the film. <br /><br />To be honest	 I didn't know what to think when Cruella de Vil seemed to have changed completely kind. In fact I have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly	 but now that she so quickly changed into ""herself"" again and announced that she was Cruella once more	 I almost began to be really worried about Chloe's Dalmatians.<br /><br />Actually	 the scene in which the puppies watched Lady and the Tramp while Chloe and Kevin had their dinner	 was much better than I had expected. I also was fond of the parrot who played to be a dog	 and it was incredible that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie. <br /><br />Of course I was content that at the end the Dalmatians were saved again	 but I would have liked to know what was going to happen to Cruella after she had lost her whole property. And what on earth could the dogs' home do with such a huge sum of money?<br /><br />Finally	 it was quite touching that Snowball also had spots at the very end of the film."	1.0
"During the whole Pirates of The Caribbean Trilogy Craze Paramount Pictures really dropped the ball in restoring this Anthony Quinn directed Cecil B. DeMille supervised movie and getting it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the extras included. It is obvious to me that Paramount Pictures Execs are blind as bats and ignorant of the fact that they have a really good pirate movie in their vault about a real pirate who actually lived in New Orleans	 Louisiana which would have helped make The Crescent City once again famous for it's Pirate Connections. When the Execs at Paramount finally get with the program and release this movie in digital format then I will be a happy camper. Paramount Pictures it is up to you to get off your duff and get this film restored now !"	1.0
"The direction had clearly stated that this film's idea and plot is totally original....however	 as to those who have read 'slam dunk' comic	 we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes...<br /><br />Another note is Jay Chow himself DO NOT know Kung Fu	 it just won't impress anyone if he tries to act like he can	 many people today can see the differences.. Luckily the movie do not contain much of KunG Fu fighting and much are enchanced by stunners and visual effects...<br /><br />I think that Jay's acting is still a pain to watch	 especially when almost everyone else in the film is so much better. The only reason I think why Jay is the main actor is simply is for his popularity.<br /><br />Despite how hard I wish to stop anyone from watching this thus making this ""orginal"" movie getting what it shouldn't have	 it has became one of the best budget films in China for this year."	0.0
"It was simple and yet so nice. I think the whole sense of sex segregation in society	 which can be bitter	 was shown very delicately. It had a bitter kind of hummer in it. The fact that most of the actors were not professionals	 made the movie more tangible and more realistic. There was a ""documentary"" side to the movie too. The best scenes were those that all the girls	 banned from watching	 were listening passionately to the soldier	 who is supposed to keep an eye on them	 broadcasting the game. If you are an Iranian	 the familiar cheering and dancing in the streets after a game won	 fills you up with National pride!! If you are not Iranian	 you'll still love it all the same!"	1.0
"Oh dear	 oh dear...<br /><br />For JM fans	 this was the nail in the coffin as far as her A-list Hollywood career was concerned. After solid turns in Girl Can't Help It	 Wayward Bus	 The Burglar and Rock Hunter it seemed Jayne was well on the way to becoming one of Tinsel Town's hottest stars. However	 an obsession with racy publicity and an appearance in this clunker relegated Mansfield to the sidelines	 namely cheap Euro loan-outs until Fox could drop her contract at the earliest opportunity.<br /><br />This movie really is a diabolical waste of everyone's time with the exception of Suzy Parker who is the only thing in this movie bad enough for the material. Many people blame poor Jayne and her grating performance for this film's poor returns at the box office and while she is a pain in this film	 she can only do her best with the material. After all	 Cary hardly sets the screen on fire does he? After a handful of very good dramatic and comedy turns Jayne takes 10 steps back in her pursuit as a serious actress by agreeing (simply for the sake of appearing with Grant) to portray this squealing	 idiotic menace. Her character of Alice is a complete cartoon bimbo and although she looks good enough to eat in a boiler suit	 her every appearance in the film jangles your nerves. We all know Jayne could do so much better than this dross and yet here she is parading around like a prize pudding. A real shame.<br /><br />Steer clear of this so-called comedy. It's more depressing than funny."	0.0
"""8 SIMPLE RULES... FOR DATING MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER	"" is my opinion	 is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure I haven't seen every episode	 but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However	 I think it was always funny when a mishap occurred. I always laughed at that. Despite the fact that James Garner and David Spade were good	 I liked the show more when John Ritter was the leading man. If you ask me	 his sudden passing was very tragic. Everyone always gave a good performance	 the production design was spectacular	 the costumes were well-designed	 and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion	 I hope some network brings it back on the air for fans of the show to see."	1.0
"Batman and Superman. Iconic. The better part of a century old. Who doesn't know of these two? There must be countless of fans who would die to make a film about them. Sandy Collora went ahead and put together a trailer for such a film(which does not exist	 and is not being created	 much less by this team). Perhaps what this has most going for it is how polished it is. Throughout	 the cinematography is solid. The editing is spot-on. The production values	 even with the costumes looking more like their comic counterparts than the ones of the feature films featuring these character	 are quite high. It looks quite ""Hollywood""	 this trailer. The physical types fit for	 as far as I can tell	 every single character. The lines are reasonably written. The shots are well-thought up	 nicely achieved and fairly effective. However	 this does have problems	 and in spite of looking good	 it doesn't quite match the energy and skill of Grayson(which only had the problem of teeter-tottering too much back and forth between a short and a trailer	 as well as unbridled passion leading to the inclusion of too many characters and ideas). The acting is perhaps the most evident. It's... not good. Even some of those who only have one line and/or hardly appear on-screen at all manage to fail at delivering a good performance. The actors cast in the parts seem to have been chosen more for how much they look like the characters they're playing than their talent. Then there is the writing. Really	 the plot	 well	 what minuscule amount there is(this and this character team up	 something about some evil plot...) is fine. There is a problem in the characterization. While most characters seem to fit	 Two-Face is	 well	 about as much as a cackling lunatic(which is quite simply	 as far as I've understood	 not what the character is) as he was in Batman Forever(and having your work on portraying any element of the Batman universe compared to Joel Schumacher's efforts can be considered the greatest insult to a fan). Also	 putting that character in this is going to cause comparisons between this trailer and that film(honestly	 Collora is practically *begging* for it with such a similar initial reveal) to be made	 and	 let's face it	 this loses in every respect. Michael Antonik most definitely does not possess the screen presence that Tommy Lee Jones does	 and the make-up(which	 in aforementioned reveal	 is essential) isn't as strong as that of the film(whether or not it was good in the film is another matter). The sad thing is that while Fiorella(John	 who created Grayson) seems to be far more into the comics	 and get them	 the depth of them	 better(not to mention possessing more of an ability to come up with compelling plot... Grayson had enough material for half a dozen feature films	 or more)	 Collora seems to be the one with access to funds and the one who's more likely to have contacts(on account of having non-indie credits on his filmography) to actually have a shot at making an actual feature out of his trailer. I intend to watch other of Collora's work. But Fiorella is the one of the two whose work I will most definitely be most interested in. I recommend this to fans of the characters. 7/10"	1.0
"When a stiff turns up with pneumonic plague (a variant of bubonic plague)	 U.S. Public Health Service official Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) immediately quarantines everyone whom he knows was near the body. Unfortunately	 the stiff got that way by being murdered	 and there's a good chance that the murderer will start spreading the plague	 leading to an epidemic. Enter Police Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas)	 who is enlisted to track down the murderer as soon as possible and avert a possible national disaster.<br /><br />While Panic in the Streets is a quality film	 it suffers from being slightly unfocused and a bit too sprawling (my reason for bringing the score down to an eight). It wanders the genres from noirish gangster to medical disaster	 police procedural	 thriller and even romance.<br /><br />This is not director Elia Kazan's best work	 but saying that is a bit disingenuous. Kazan is the helmer responsible such masterpieces as A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)	 On The Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955)	 after all. This film predates those	 but Kazan has said that he was already ""untethered"" by the studio. Taking that freedom too far may partially account for the sprawl. The film is set in New Orleans	 a city where Kazan ""used to wander around . . . night and day so I knew it well"". He wanted to exploit the environment. ""It's so terrific and colorful. I wanted boats	 steam engines	 warehouses	 jazz joints--all of New Orleans"".<br /><br />Kazan handles each genre of Panic in the Streets well	 but they could be connected better. The film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods. The sprawl in terms of setting would have still worked. Part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that Panic in the Streets was an attempt to merge two stories by writers Edna and Edward Anhalt	 ""Quarantine"" and ""Some Like 'Em Cold"".<br /><br />The gangster material	 which ends up in firmly in thriller territory with an extended chase scene near the end of the film	 is probably the highlight. Not surprisingly	 Kazan has said that he believes the villains are ""more colorful--I never had much affection for the good guys anyway. I don't like puritans"". A close second is the only material that approaches the ""panic"" of the title--the discovery of the plague and the attempts to track down the exposed	 inoculate them and contain the disease. While there is plenty of suspense during these two ""moods""	 much of the film is also a fairly straightforward drama	 with pacing more typical of that genre.<br /><br />The dialogue throughout is excellent. The stylistic difference to many modern films could hardly be more pronounced. It is intelligent	 delivered quickly and well enunciated by each character. Conflict isn't created by ""dumb"" decisions but smart moves; events and characters' actions are more like a chess game. When unusual stances are taken	 such as Reed withholding the plague from the newspapers	 he gives relatively lengthy justifications for his decisions	 which other characters argue over.<br /><br />In light of this	 it's interesting that Kazan believed that ""propriety	 religion	 ethics and the middle class are all murdering us"". That idea works its way into the film through the alterations to the norm	 or allowances away from it	 made by the protagonists. For example	 head gangster Blackie (Jack Palance in his first film role) is offered a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card if he'll cooperate with combating the plague.<br /><br />The technical aspects of the film are fine	 if nothing exceptional	 but the real reasons to watch are the performances	 the intriguing scenario and the well-written dialogue."	1.0
"It's hard to believe	 after waiting 14 years	 we wind up with this piece of cinematic garbage. The original was a high impact	 dark thriller that achieved ""cult"" status demonstrating the fine art of cinema as directed by Paul Verhoeven. This film adds nothing	 delivers nothing	 and ultimately winds up in the big box of failed sequels.<br /><br />The opening sequence could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerably talented and able cast. Unfortunately we are treated to a 90 minute dissertation in the self-indulgent life of Catherine Tramell... or is it Sharon Stone. Possibly a copulation of both.<br /><br />If the desire is too see a continuation of the sensually provocative stying of sex as in ""B.S.1""	 forget it. You wind up with soft-porn boredom which ultimately upholds the old adage that a woman can be more alluring in clothes than out of them. It's interesting to note that the wonderful Charlotte Rampling was romping around in her skivvies	 via the 1966 GEORGY GIRL	 when Ms. Stone was only 8 years old. A very talented actress and quite adept at holding her own even here.<br /><br />If you're a true cinema fan then you must see this film and judge it using your own rating system. If not	 you might as well wait for the DVD release in the ""rated"" version	 ""unrated"" version	 ""collectors"" edition	 or ""ultimate"" version	 and perhaps in another 14 years we will be saturated with news of ""Basic Instinct 3"" at which point Ms. Stone will be 62 years old and nobody will really care."	0.0
"I may not be the one to review this movie because after 45 minutes of pure boredom and stupidity I turned the channel.

"We have a lake. We have an animated meteor crashing. We have a killer stop-motion dinosaur with flippers. Okay	 so let's call this movie THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What else can we add? Hmm	 two idiots called Arnie & Mitch to define the ultimate definition of ""comic relief"". We also got to have a sheriff who doesn't really do a damn thing in this film and whom nobody listens to. Aw crap	 we're over halfway through the movie and we forgot to insert a bad guy! No worries	 let's introduce some guy with a moustache	 have him rob a store to indicate he's a bad guy	 then have him pop up somewhere near the lake	 have him chased through the woods and all this for the sole purpose of him ending up as dinosaur snack food. That should work.<br /><br />A complete	 clumsy mess	 this film. Its logic will twist your mind to force laughter out of you. The first film to feature Dave Allen as a ""stop motion supervisor"". After this one	 he joined forces with Charles Band for several years until the the mid-nineties	 when Band ran out of money to pay him	 I guess. The dinosaur effects are charming and the whole film is pretty damn unintentionally funny. Unfortunately	 that's about the only good thing that can be said for it.<br /><br />Good Badness? Yes. The mind-bending logic in the narrative should be enough reason to put it on the list. If not	 Arnie & Mitch will do the trick. 3/10 and 8/10"	0.0
"This film was the worst film I have ever viewed. It was like a ""homework assignment"" for a film class. It totally misses the mark when it comes to the ""message"" it is TRYING to relay. Characters are over exaggerated	 poor acting and as for a plot...well it is utterly ridiculous. The cover shot is what made me think it may be a decent film	 the co-actor is handsome and that's about it. Moral of this movie: NEVER JUDGE A MOVIE BY IT'S COVER! Save your time	 money and energy and make your own home movie and you will be far better off than I. It was painful to watch and quite frankly I am surprised that anyone would spend money to make and distribute it!"	0.0
"The screen writing is so dumb it pains me to have wasted 2 hours of my life I'll never get back (where have I heard this before). The acting is so-so. Things change often enough to keep you watching and waiting for something gruesome to happen. Nevertheless there isn't a single original thing in this movie. While the first Cube was a nerdy horror movie	 which didn't make a whole lot of sense in the end	 cube zero has picked up on that and tries to retell exactly the same story	 except this time it makes an obnoxious point of trying to spoon-feed explanations for every detail that the first movie didn't answer. The comic thing is	 the director recycles the exact scenes of the first movie that were somewhat weird	 and tries to explain them. But the scenes are just copied over	 there is no coherence whatsoever. This script is sooo pointless. I can imagine it being written by some half-wit 15 year old with a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a class project. The best part is in the end	 they cripple the 'good' wunderkind guy	 and he becomes the retarded fellow in the first movie	 and you see him when they find him ('this room is green..') in Cube 1997. Goodie gooodie	 clap clap	 what a twist. First of all	 what about if you haven't seen the first one	 this doesn't make any sense you nitwit director. Oh	 another great idea: instead of the numbers to identify x	y	z coordinates of the room (cube 1997)	 this time it is 3 letters	 each one giving one of 26 possible coordinate values. Duh. Except now permutations don't make much sense anymore..so he lets the letters disappear before anybody can use them..I want my money back.<br /><br />I guess I had to write this down since there are just so many bad	 inconsistent	 or just stupid ideas in this movie. Directors/writers should be required to possess some talent."	0.0
"This anime is a must-see for fans of Evangelion. It's an earlier work of Anno Hideaki	 but his unrestrained	 dramatic style is quite in place. Also	 those who didn't like Evangelion might find this release to bit slightly more palatable. Gunbuster is rather unique to sci-fi anime in that it's actually based on real science. In fact	 the show has several little ""Science Lesson"" interludes explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie. One of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds near that of light. The series does a wonderful job of dealing with the imaginably traumatic experience of leaving earth on a six month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an Earth where ten years have passed. The main character remains age 17 or 18 throughout the entire series while almost all of the other characters age considerably. Be warned	 this show is heavy on the sap at times. It also has a couple of the most wholly unmerited breast shots that I have ever seen. I found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo-hoo scenes	 because the series is otherwise very good	 but viewers with a low sap tolerance might want to stay away from this one. On an interesting note	 Gainax	 as always	 managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes. However	 they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway. The ending is a bit silly	 but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut I couldn't help but love it. Gunbuster is	 in my opinion	 one of the finest pieces of Anime around."	1.0
"I had read a few positive reviews of this film	 and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was. Positioned as some cross between an AIDS-related story and some kind of ""Ghost""/""Blithe Spirit"" tale	 this film can't always make it's mind up what it wants to be. <br /><br />Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have an ""open"" relationship - Simon is able to have anonymous (though safe) sex on the side when he wants. Mark is HIV+ and he and Simon don't seem to have a sex life anymore. When Mark dies	 Simon - who has made a habit of shutting off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father - tries to erase his memory and just get on with being a bachelor. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was much different. But Mark returns in ghostly form and foils his various trysts	 while getting Simon to open up and admit his true feelings.<br /><br />Unfortunately	 Simon is such a selfish SOB	 it's impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film. By the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic	 it's too late to care. Mark	 on the other hand	 follows in Demi Moore's footsteps from ""Ghost	"" by crying profusely throughout the movie. <br /><br />There is a bizarre switch in tone after Mark returns. Suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor	 a la the TV show ""Bewitched."" But that doesn't last long. Once Simon's emotional health is at stake	 the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish	 with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings. The finale	 with a gold-plated muscle-boy angel guiding a tearful Mark to heaven while a chastened	 grief-stricken Simon waves goodbye is just stupefying	 chiefly because it isn't intentionally funny."	0.0
"*** Contains Spoilers ***<br /><br />I did not like this movie at all.<br /><br />I found it amazingly boring and rather superficially made	 irrespective of the importance and depth of the proposed themes: given that eventually we have to die	 how should we approach life? In a ""light"" way	 like Tomas; in a ""heavy"" way like Tereza; or should we find ways not to face that question	 like Sabina? How much is fidelity important in a relationship? How much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones? How much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our Country?<br /><br />Unfortunately	 I haven't read Kundera's novel but after having being let down by the movie I certainly will: I want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation (which is my guess) or if it was dull from the beginning.<br /><br />I disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece. I simply don't see the reasons why. What I see are many flaws	 and a sample of them follows.<br /><br />1) The three main characters are thrown at you and it's very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices.<br /><br />2) The ""secondary"" characters are there just to fill the gaps but they don't add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary.<br /><br />3) I did not like how Tomas was impersonated. Nothing is good for him. He is so self-centered and selfish. He is not human	 in some sense. But when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone	 I did not find the interpretation credible.<br /><br />4) It's very unlikely that an artist like Sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. On top of that	 the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions	 which sounds strange to me. a) how can Tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer? b) how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed?<br /><br />5) The fake accents of the English spoken by the actors are laughable. And I am not even mother tongue. Moreover	 the letter that Sabina receives while in the US is written in Czech	 which I found very inconsistent.<br /><br />6) Many comments praised the movie saying that Prague was beautifully rendered: I guess that most of the movie was shot on location	 so it's not difficult to give the movie a Eastern European feeling	 and given the intrinsic beauty of Prague is not even difficult to make it look good.<br /><br />7) I found the ending sort of trivial. Tereza and Tomas	 finally happy in the countryside	 far away from the temptations of the ""metropoly""	 distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living	 detached from their professional lives	 die in a car accident. But they die after having realized that they are happy	 indeed. So what? Had they died unhappy	 would the message of the movie have been different? I don't think so. I considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience.<br /><br />8) The only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters. You see them for almost three hours	 but in the end you are left with nothing. You don't feel empathy	 you don't relate to them	 you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say.<br /><br />9) I hated the ""stop the music in the restaurant"" scene (which some comments praised a lot). Why Sabina has got such a strong reaction? Why Franz agrees with her? I really don't see the point. The only thing you learn is that Sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality. That's it. What's so special and unique about it?<br /><br />After all these negative comments	 let me point tout that there are two scenes that I liked a lot (that's why I gave it a two).<br /><br />The ""Naked women Photoshoot""	 where the envy	 the jealousy	 and the insecurities of Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented.<br /><br />The other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of Prague by the Russians. Tereza pictures	 taken to let the world know about what is going on in Prague	 are used to identify the people taking part to the riots. I found it quite original and Tereza's sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayed.<br /><br />Finally	 there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally ""designed"" in such a way that ""Tomas types"" are going to like it and ""Tereza ones"" are going to hate it. If this is the case (I strongly doubt it	 though) then my comment should be revised drastically."	0.0
"Damn	 was that a lot to take in. I was pretty much mesmerised throughout. It was pretty perfect	 though I would say the editing had a lot to do with that. I can't believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them (Anton especially) to get all of this footage without any serious... beef. The Dandy's did come off well-together	 middle-class kids who took advantage of their situation (and rightly so!). I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton	 which maybe wasn't what a lot of other people felt. Great piece of film-making and great choice of subject(s).

"This is a terrible film	 and not one scene has an ounce of truthful emotion. The characters are uninflected	 obviously drawn	 predictable and the story line is obvious and typical Hollywood wish fulfillment.<br /><br />William Holden (so sad to see him in this role) was 55 when this film was made	 but he's playing someone in his early 40s and looks like he's in his 60s. Kay Lenz was 20 and was scripted to find him irresistibly attractive. I think the dog they found by the side of the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic connection.<br /><br />Holden's character--the same age as Clint Eastwood when he directed this film	 (not) coincidentally--is placed with obvious trappings of 60s pre-hippie cool: the bachelor pad	 the swinging hi-fi	 the lunches at Yamashiro. But the film is ridiculously uncool	 a clanging claptrap of old fogies desperately wishing that the free spirits they saw on Sunset and in Laurel Canyon would find them and their big honkin' cars sexy.<br /><br />Ugh. Youth culture was never that desperate. And I shudder to think that Bill Holden was so desperate for youth that he took this embarrassing part."	0.0

"This centers on unironic notions of coming to grips with guilt. <br /><br />Merrill berates the distraught boy to stop his 'whining' about Rennie's death. Old-style real men in action	 here.<br /><br />The crashing model plane and car crash must have been impressive on the big screen.<br /><br />The storytelling itself	 despite the flashback sequences	 plays it straight -- all the narrators are trusted by us (regardless of the 'truth' or 'untruth' of the dialogue)	 so there's no game with the viewer about narrative structure.

"This is a very entertaining film which follows the rehearsal process of a NY production of Macbeth. Although it has a lot to say about power	 jealousy and ambition (the themes of Macbeth) in our modern world	 the film works best when it is not taking itself too seriously. Recognizable actors such as John Glover	 Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury do nice jobs in the main roles	 but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene where the ""murder"" of Banquo (John Elsen) is rehearsed. Probably a more entertaining film for those involved in theatre	 but anyone who enjoys Shakespeare should enjoy this film."	1.0
"I got this movie in the $5 bin at walmart. I would not recommend watching this move. I might give it to one of my friends if I am angry at them and want them to suffer for 2 hours.<br /><br />I looked at the cover and skimmed through the summary and thought it was a war movie. I wish I would have known how boring this movie was going to be before turning it on. It was my mistake to think something was going to happen in this movie. It's just about a group of people going from one boot camp to another. The drill sargents treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of fighting in Vietnam.<br /><br />Okay	 here is my rant about this movie: To me	 this movie is slow and hard to watch. It was just one of those movies that you put in and are stuck watching because you want to turn it off but your hanging on to a string of hope that it might pick up towards the end. It doesn't. After the movie was over I through it behind my T.V. because I was angry that I wasted almost 2 hours of my life watching it	 and another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people about it."	0.0
"I really enjoyed this debut by Ring director	 Hideo Nakata. If you've seen Ring beforehand then you'll be familiar with the style and idea of this flick. It's got a subtle spookiness about it that works better than the constant (and predictable) stingers that infest most mainstream movies of this genre. If you like films that give you the chills	 then you will probably like this one. A good	 creepy debut by Hideo Nakata. 8/10"	1.0
"This movie can be interpreted on many different levels. Don't listen to the other comments bashing the movie and saying that it is a played again story or w/e and that it is just about drugs. It has very overt superficial metaphors about drugs; however	 the rest of the movie (and why I think it was personally made) is really not about that at all. It is really mocking psychology and the conditioning of society. It shows	 for a split second	 that the main character's brother is watching those sick videos online. Why? My interpretation is that it is to demonstrate that all of this gruesomeness that we are exposed to makes it easier for us to be mechanical in our professions instead of seeing people as people. As far as the scene about logic	 it is also reaching out to the people who were in the federally mandated 1% smart classes who are confused and frustrated because life isn't as predictable and mathematical and logical as it seems on a macroscopic level. You have to apply Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (along with all the other laws and principles of uncertainty) not just to physics but to life and leave room to change your plans and adjust along the way. One of the best movies I have ever seen. It just might go way above your head; it isn't for you it is for those people who are are having trouble coping with life not working out like a math problem. When you are critically analyzing a movie or writing your critical review's try not reading the back cover first (written by marketers and parapsychologists)"	1.0
"I have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest/worst attempts at one. A lot of the scenes work in a plug-and-play manner inserted strictly to conform to the romantic-comedy genre. Usually this is okay because we're dealing with a genre	 but the challenge generally resides in making it original	 new and inventive. This movie fails to do so.<br /><br />There is no sense of who the characters really are	 apart from Sylvie Moreau's (who is the real star of this movie	 not Isabelle Blais). They fit into this one-dimensional cliché and they become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrative.<br /><br />The pacing of the movie can become annoying	 rhythm lacks	 and the editing is filled with unnecessary close-ups. I should also mention the overly stylized decors making some scenes devoid of any naturally	 or rather	 making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious. Of course	 along with that	 you have the right-on-cue sappy music which unfortunately often sounds mismatched.<br /><br />I can't believe that a movie who makes obvious Woody Allen allusions ends up being this deceptive. If you expect a good light-hearted romantic comedy	 this is not it. Or rather	 this a poor attempt at it. You will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been getting such praise when cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are far superior Quebecois directors making better flicks.<br /><br />Les Aimants is a good movie for what it is. But it's a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as auteur's."	0.0
"We all knew even before it aired	 the Ron Moore mini-series is no Battlestar Galactica. That's fine. It just means it must stand on its own. It can't lean on Battlestar Galactica. If it's any good	 it's good on it's own merits	 and Ron Moore has something to be proud of. If reports are true	 this is what Moore wanted. However	 if his mini-series rots	 he has shamed all the excellent actors that performed on-screen	 not to mention the myriad off-screen personnel. And this is what he's done.<br /><br />Yes	 this mini-series is no remake. I wouldn't even call it a re-imagining. It's a new production	 inspired by Battlestar Galactica. It does not take place in the Galactica universe	 with the same places and jargon and technology. It doesn't tell of the Galactica's search for the thirteenth tribe. Nor does it rely on the legends and mysteries that underpinned Galactica. Ron Moore's mini-series is a space-opera	 action flick with a ceremonial nod to Battlestar Galactica.<br /><br />Maybe I should say	 ""just another"" space-opera	 action flick. Because as plots go	 his has little that's original	 or even interesting. I could relay the whole thing to you without a spoiler warning. But I won't inflict that on you. I'll just hit the most important point. Ready now? Here it is: Just watch the trailer. It will tell you everything there is in the story.<br /><br />Yes	 creations of man turn on man and seek to destroy man. (I guess they forgot Azimov's rules	 again.) They look like humans	 so there's the whole aliens-among-us thing. At least there's no time-travel. Oh	 and lots of fighting scenes and random acts of sex and violence. The end result was that when Moore did draw from Galactica	 that ceremonial nod	 it came off more corny than respectful. I mean	 couldn't he even think up anything of his own?<br /><br />From the first few minutes	 I wanted to watch something else. I didn't care about any of Moore's characters	 since I couldn't identify with any of them. This fact hit me in the face when the Cylons began their attack. Armageddon on a planetary scale	 and I didn't give a damn. How depressing.<br /><br />Moore's heroes when faced with an insurmountable obstacle	 instead of overcoming it	 rather tucked tail and saved their own butts. After all	 it was the only way to save humanity	 yadda yadda yadda. They took the safe way out	 rather than risking their own lives to defend others. At least disgust is not apathy.<br /><br />But in the end	 the Ron Moore mini-series was just activity without purpose	 a movie on a treadmill	 forever running yet going nowhere. And I just wanted it to be over. And by the time it was over	 my life-force had been sucked from me. Against my own will	 I was turning into a mindless	 soulless zombie	 probably of the type to which this mini-series would appeal. I needed to replenish myself. I needed to-and I swear this is true-I needed to watch an episode of Babylon 5. Two episodes	 in fact	 and I felt much better. And happier."	0.0
"During 1933 this film had many cuts taken from it because it was very over the top for the story content and the fact that Lily Powers	(Barbara Stanwyck) would do anything to obtain great wealth and power. Lily's father had forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14 and she grew up in a steel mill of a town with very poor people and her father ran a speakeasy which brought into his home all kinds of male characters who had their eye on Lily. As the story progresses	 Lily meets up with man after man and eventually finds a guy who has everything and is a playboy bank president It is great to see a very young John Wayne	 (Jimmy McCoy Jr.) who was only 25 when this picture was produced and Jimmy did not even get to first base with Lily	 not even for lunch. A very young George Brent	 (Coutland Trenholm) stars along with Barbara Stanwyck and both gave outstanding performances. This is a great film from 1933 which was produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and was locked up in a fault for many years and just recently is being shown on the silver screen. This film is rather mild compared to what we view on the Hollywood screens today	 but in 1933 it was very naughty to watch this type of film. Enjoy"	1.0
"First let me say that Before Sunrise	 like all movies	 is NOT a movie for all tastes. It appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact	 but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie generates from some people. For me	 like most folks here	 Before Sunrise struck a deep chord in me	 I was truly stunned	 moved	 inspired by it. This is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing. It creates some of the most awesomely unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine. It is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings I got from it.<br /><br />The movie works as a communion of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other. It is very intelligent and inspiring	 not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of Jesse and Celine's discussions	 but rather the little nuances	 the perfectly articulate responses they provoke from each other. It captures an honest	 romantic	 yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to blossom in the awesomely sublime Viennese milieu; it convinces us that their evanescent relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world. And what happens after that night is open for debate	 but I never doubt that they won't each other again.<br /><br />The facile comments by RockytheBear and the below user are hopeless examples of a doctrinaire dissenter unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie.<br /><br />See it and it may change your way of life."	1.0
"I remember this movie in particular when I was a teenager	 my best friend was telling me all about this movie and how it freaked her out as a kid. Of course being the blood thirsty gal that I am	 I had to go out and find this movie. Now I don't know how to put this without loosing credibility	 so I'm just going to say it	 I actually had fun watching this movie! I know that it's stupid	 not the best story and beyond bloody and gruesome	 but that's what I was looking for and The Dentist delivers in the scares	 blood	 sex	 and crazy psychopaths. Sometimes I just need a fun movie like this to just let loose and get grossed out by.<br /><br />Dr. Alan Feinstone is obsessed with order and cleanliness. On the day of his wedding anniversary	 he spies his wife Brooke having sex with their filthy pool man	 Matt. At his dental practice	 Feinstone's first patient of the day is young Jody Saunders	 there for his very first dental appointment. Feinstone begins to clean Jody's teeth. Everything goes smoothly at first	 until he imagines that Jody's teeth are brown and rotten. His dental pick slips	 stabbing Jody in the gums. Jody's mother picks up her crying	 bleeding child and leaves angrily. Feinstone sees his second patient	 beauty queen April Reign. Alone with April	 Feinstone sedates her with nitrous oxide so that he can fill a cavity in one of her molars. As she drifts off into unconsciousness	 Feinstone imagines that she has transformed into his wife. He begins kissing and fondling her on the dental chair	 then begins to choke her. April starts to cough and half-wakes up from the gas. Feinstone snaps out of his trance and quickly re-buttons April's blouse. Feinstone decides to end the day early and sends his staff and patients home. Later that night	 Brooke meets Feinstone at his practice. He reveals his new Italian opera-themed patient room. He encourages Brooke to try out the room's dental chair. When she does	 Feinstone binds her to the chair and sedates her with nitrous oxide. With operatic music blaring in the background	 he begins to pull out Brooke's teeth. Feinstone has gone off the deep end and is definitely not going to let anybody stand in his way of cleanliness.<br /><br />Honestly	 as silly as this movie sounds	 I did have a lot of fun watching The Dentist. The best scene without a doubt is when he teaches that nasty IRS agent a lesson in hygiene that I'm sure he'll never forget. Man	 I don't think I've brushed my teeth so much after I watched The Dentist. Yeah	 I am going to warn you	 this movie is in no way for the faint of heart	 it's very bloody. There's stabbing	 gun shots and just these brutal dental torture scenes that will make your stomach turn. Yet somehow I just enjoyed this movie	 if I ever want just a good gore movie that was made for true horror fans	 I slip it in my DVD player	 and that's the ""tooth"" LOL! I am so funny! Um	 yeah	 I try	 give me a little credit.<br /><br />7/10"	1.0
"This was my favourite film as a child	 and I have been in the stage production a few times so it will always remain my favourite muscical and I doubt anybody could ever re-make the story of Oliver Twist on screen	 any better than this one did.<br /><br />My all-time favourite ''bad guy'' has to be Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. Not only did he scare the life out of my when I watched it as a 6 year old	 but now as a woman I can empathize more with Nancys character	 the bar maid/prostitute who helps Oliver get the life he deserves.<br /><br />Jack Wilde as the artful dodger	 was fantastic	 and I don't think anybody could ever out-do him	 as the street-pocket picker	 and best friend of Fagin. The music is fantastic	 especially Fagin's numbers	 I'm also quite thankful they didn't give Bill Sikes a musical number	 it wouldn't of worked with him being such a sinister character.<br /><br />I think Carol Reed did an excellent job of Nancy's sticky ending	 keeping it a G rated movie by disguising her beating	 but giving enough away to show the violence of Bill towards her. <br /><br />This movie is both charming	 and charismatic as a musical sing-along	 as well as being a moving drama that follows a young boy as he tries to find where he belongs in life."	1.0
"The plot of the story and the performance of the lead actors are very much down-to-earth! The romance between two teen-age boys on the screen was done in good taste.

"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** When I saw a preview for this movie I thought it was going to be atleast a slightly admirable storyline. But as most superstation original movies I was left disapointed. This gullible family ends up driving through this ""deserted"" town to take a brake and find this video camera showing these people doing everything their donig and finds out they all eventually disappear	 the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or displays what the heck is stalking them. Their are more gaps than I can count and they don't explain anything that happens how or what. It ends where the family gets in a car accident and get posest or brainwashed or something( which is never explained). The next thing you know ur hoping they somehow find out how all it happened but it ends leaving you completely confused."	0.0
"The first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape	 complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame. It presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her. The hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers	 her hand smashed with a hammer	 her eye punctured with a needle	 and so forth.<br /><br />In the most nauseating scene	 the woman's captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns. The series received a great deal of publicity when American actor Charlie Sheen	 believing the series to contain actual murder	 attempted to ban its distribution in the United States. An FBI investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers -- sick re-creations using nasty	 but obvious special effects. Gruesomely staged by acclaimed Japanese comic-book artist Hideshi Hino	 who also directed the third and fourth episodes	 this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms. But	 gorehounds probably won't find anything special."	1.0
"I don't understand the low 5.7 rating on this film. It's a delight for people who like a strong suspense plot and dark atmospherics. The tone is reminiscent of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil	 down to the locale (Savannah). The acting is strong	 and I was amazed at the verisimilitude of Kenneth Branagh's southern accent. Famke Jansen is great	 Robert Duval is effective in a small part	 and Embeth Davitz is the BOMB. Great full nude scene of her	too.<br /><br />The plot is fairly standard but effectively executed."	1.0
"I first saw the film when it landed on US cable a year after it came out. It blew my little head away	 I was only 16 and it was the first new wave music I'd heard	 having been a strictly folky	 classical kid growing up. The music mesmerized me	 as did Hazel O'Connor's amazing look and charismatic vocal performances	 and Phil Daniels' tough but soft Cockney manager just stole my heart. But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Pryce's drugged out sax player. He was so out of place in the band and so harmless and pathetic	 he just begged for sympathy. Favorite scenes	 the performance when the lights went out	 and the love scene on the train.<br /><br />Okay	 so the movie isn't the Rose! But it was really excellent for its limited budget and for its portrayal of the Britain of the early 80's	 exploding with rebellious youth	 looking for a way out of the dole queue. I went to Britain only a couple of years later and found the movie to have been very reflective of the atmosphere I found when I was there.<br /><br />If you get a chance to	 see it. It is a great movie	 with some wonderful performances	 and the music will blow you away.<br /><br />"	1.0
"The opening credits make for a brilliant	 atmospheric piece of escapist entertainment that's full of little nods to the comic strip. All the good guys are good	 all the bad guys are bad	 and the film is jam-packed with familiar character actors covered in gruesom make-up to hi-lite their characteristics.<br /><br />Warren Beatty	 as Dick Tracy	 is the ultimate tough guy straight man	 incorruptable	 calm usually	 always a better fighter than the other guy	 and rarely one to push the limit on legality. Al Pacino	 as ""Big Boy"" Caprice steals every scene he's in as a hunch-backed gangster in some unnamed metropolis of 1930s gangsters. Maddonna plays the kind of person she'd probably play best	 Breathless Mahoney	 a nightclub singer and femme fatale with her own little agenda going. Gleanne Headly is Tracy's tough-talking	 fiercely independent long-time girlfrined. And then there's The Kid	 a funny little street urchin Tracy takes in	 who models himself after his surrogate father	 and saves Tracy when the detective has accepted his fate of being blown up.<br /><br />The supporting players are a Who's Who of character actors. Charles Durning is the chief of police. Dick Van Dyke is the District Attorney	 who's bribed by Big Boy's goons to keep him on the streets. Dustin Hoffman has a humorous turn as Mumbles	 the snitch whose dialect is so indecipherable the cops can't make head nor tail of what he has to say. R.G. Armstrong is Pruneface	 one of the rival gangsters Big Boy forms a special allegiance to in order to create a network of crime spreading throughout the whole city. Mandy Patinkin is 88 Keys	 the piano player for Breathless's show. Paul Sorvino plays Lips Manlis	 Breathless's former benefactor until Big Boy gives him ""the Bath."" James Caan wears relatively little make-up in his performance as the only gangster who won't go along with Big Boy's grand plan. William Forsythe and Ed O'Ross are Big Boy's enforcers	 Flattop and Itchy.<br /><br />This movie retains all of the corn of the comic strip	 plus it is full of vibrant colors. Almost all the suits are elaborate in blues and greens and yellows and reds. All the colors of the rainbow are found in this movie--and then some! The matte paintings that are used truly realize this world as two-dimensional	 only acted in three-dimensional sets. The humor is plentiful. Al Pacino fills the shoes of his character like no other character he's played before or since. Big Boy is kind of crazy	 and kind of self-pitying. He's an eccentric little man who takes pride in quoting our Founding Fathers and likening himself to great political leaders. The man with the plan	 always looking for the smartest way to do business."	1.0

"Admittedly	 Parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to everyone	 although it is a favourite of mine	 Knappertsbusch	 1951	 in particular. Syberberg's entire approach is so static. Whenever the music suddenly begins to swell ... Syberberg keeps the cast moving at the same pace. The takes on Amfortas and Klingsor are endless. Whatever happened to film editing? The result is physically exhausting to watch. The viewer is never spiritually transported. Your impulse is to rush home and play a recording again to confirm that Wagner got it right	 Syberberg got it wrong. And that set decoration with those ""clever"" reminders of Wagner's anti-Semitism -- will there ever be a viewer of this film with no prior knowledge of Wagner?"	0.0
"A typical romp through Cheech and Chong's reality which includes drugs	 singing	 more drugs	 cars and driving	 even more drugs	 Pee Wee	 aliens	 gasoline	 laundry	 stand up comedy	 surprisingly more drugs and SPACE COKE !!. It is not as coherent or plausible as Up in Smoke but it still is incredibly funny	 without becoming as strange as Nice Dreams. There are some classic scenes	 which include the opening scene where they get some gas for their car and the drive to work. Also funny is Cheech's song (Mexican-Americans) and Chong's follow up song. Another notable scene is the welfare office scene with Jones (human noise machine)	 from the Police Academy series	 and the old laughing man. All in all	 this is a great follow up to Up in Smoke and is quite watchable when sober or not.<br /><br />-Celluloid Rehab"	1.0
"How you could say that Peaches	 with its complex narrative dealing with a multitude of issues	 is ""a small TV idea"" is beyond me. Besides I can think of many films that have ""a small TV idea"" in their plots. Your obvious dislike of the TV industry ("" Sue Smith has failed to rise above her television background"") is confusing. particularly as you are having such ""a great time"" working in TV. If only we could all be so talented as Ms Smith (no	 I am not a friend or relative) - AFI award winning Brides of Christ	 Road from Coorain	etc. All made for TV. Come to think of it	 what about those other ""small TV ideas"" like ""Against the Wind""	 ""Bodyline""	 ""The Dismissal""	 ""Scales of Justice""	 ""Blue Murder""	 ""Water under the Bridge"" 	etc. I think Peaches is a good entertaining film which had me interested	 and most of my friends as well	 from start to finish. It is far from flawless yet I think it is among the best Australian films I have seen over the last couple of years. Who knows	 with a few more viewings (there's so much to think about)	 it might just be up there with classics like ""The Year My Voice Broke""	 ""The Devil's Playground"". I really did enjoy this film much more than ""Somersault"" and ""Three Dollars"". These films	 I think	 had their moments-surreal	 atmospheric	 realistic and dealing with important contemporary issues	 but as for sheer entertainment for mr.and mrs average movie goer and me	 it was very ordinary if not boring. When I go to a movie	 I am always conscious of the audience's reaction to a film (through in- cinemas reactions and overheard conversations in the foyer and loo). Some came out of Peaches shaking their heads	 some with negative criticisms	 but many seemed to have enjoyed the experience."	1.0
"With a relatively small budget for an animated film of only $60 million the people at Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done an incredible job.<br /><br />They have combined state-of-the-art digital animation	 the perfectly cast voice talents of Ray Romano	 John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create a highly entertaining	 family film with a strong message about cooperation	 friendship and caring for your fellow herd members. And how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a herd.<br /><br />While watching this film I got a strong political message about getting along with the people that share your space -- maybe it should be required viewing for all world leaders!<br /><br />David Newman -- yet another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers -- provides a superb score that is not intrusive yet serves to move the action along and	 at times	 is positively toe tapping.<br /><br />The overall look of the film is incredible; an intensely coloured	 strangely believable fantasyland of snow	 geysers	 mud	 rocks and ice. The individual characters were delightfully believable too	 with the facial expressions of Ray Romano's Manfred' being a particular treat.<br /><br />The entire sequence with the DoDos will leave no doubt as to where the expression `Dumb as a DoDo comes from.'<br /><br />This is a good family film that keeps the things that could alarm or frighten children pretty much sanitized -- but real nonetheless.<br /><br />It would be a great movie to see in the theater and to buy for home."	1.0
"Before seeing this movie	 I was expecting a fictional drama based loosely on ideas from the book; instead	 it's the book	 interrupted with dramatic scenes illustrating the different ""illnesses."" That didn't bother me much	 but it hindered my enjoyment of the film. One story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed through the movie would have been preferable	 in my opinion. If you're going to base a movie on a psychology text	 you've got to find a more interesting (and preferably accurate) text than this one. The film drags during parts where it's little more than a video encyclopedia of 19th century sexual psychology and would be utterly intolerable if it weren't sexual in nature (because ""sex = interesting"" for most of us	 even me). Luckily	 there are several stories with actual character development that pull us in.<br /><br />But	 disappointingly	 Krafft-Ebing's theories of sexuality went unchallenged	 for the most part. I was hoping it would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology which is still held by many to this day.<br /><br />So	 in the end	 what do you have? A detailed catalog of a few fetishes and orientations	 with some mildly interesting stories showing the trials and tribulations of a few ""sexual deviants"" before they are cured. For most of the film	 the film moves with the crawling speed (and mood) of a wake. And	 as an obviously low budget film	 the cinematography and acting are not exactly top tier. Although I *was* pleased with the music	 costume and interior design.<br /><br />I felt this film's subject was right up my alley	 and I still feel it's a below average film. It deserves a 3/10; a 4/10 if I were feeling extremely generous. I can't imagine anyone enjoying this if they didn't already have an interest in sexual fetishism."	0.0
"Having seen both ""Fear of a Black Hat"" and ""This is Spinal Tap""	 I can honestly state that while similar	 both movies are truly must see. There will be many times in ""Fear"" that will have you in hysterics. It is no wonder why both movies have such a huge cult following. ""Fear"" will soon be available on DVD. Rent it if you must	 but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself."	1.0

"The delivery of some very humorous rude lines by Pierce Brosnan is alone worth the price of admission. He plays a kind of ""James Bond's psycho twin brother""	 separated at birth	 no doubt. As an intense hit-man	 his character is very sexual but even better	 very funny. Add the kind-hearted	 uber-likable American ""guy next door'	 Greg Kinnear	 to set up contrast. The myriad locations	 vivid colors	 and quick-witted humor provide great entertainment. Hope Davis is well cast as the ""gem of a wife"". But the focus of the film is on the two fellows	 a new ""Odd Couple""	 and that's the part that works very well. Have a great (probably R-rated) laugh	 and look for the places where the story goes a little deeper."	1.0
"The past few months I have collected Voyager seasons 4 to 7 on DVD (I only had 1 to 3 on video before that	 because Kes is my favourite character) and have just reached the end. I saw them when they were originally shown on TV here in the UK but had forgotten most of it. Am I satisfied with the ending? I think I am. Naturally as I fan I would have liked to have seen more about what happened to the characters when they got home but that's left to our imagination. In many ways ""Endgame"" is similar to Next Gen's ""All Good Things "" The involvement of the crew in the future	 but mainly the captain. A new romance starting in the finale (Troi and Worf in Next Gen and Seven of Nine and Chakotay here)	 which results in death in the future. I truly loved ""Endgame	"" fair to all characters	 Neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier. B'elanna gives birth to her daughter with loving husband Tom. Tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be cured. Harry has always been the most anxious and determined but admits the journey is important. The Doctor	 in the future	 is well respected by all and finally chooses the name Joe! But of course the Captain has the largest role	 meeting her future self who wants to get the crew home earlier to prevent casualties. The Borg are involved	 as they have played a massive part in this period of Voyager. Alice Krige plays the Borg Queen again fantastically	 just her voice and acting method are magnificent. I feel sorry for Susanna Thompson though	 the TV Borg queen replaced by the movie Borg queen. Maybe she wasn't available though. The special effects are fantastic	 the Borg sub space hub and the Borg queen falling apart! It's very tense. Especially when they come out of the Borg subspace corridor and say their location is right where they thought they'd be after they'd said they'd have to go in a corridor that leads back to the delta quadrant. And what a wonderful idea to get inside a Borg sphere for protection	 on the DVD special features they say it was like the Trojan horse. Voyager could have continued. If it was more popular they would have stuck with their original idea of the crew realising the ship is their home	 like in Harry's speech and what Tom said because his wife and child are there. And then they could have got home in a film!<br /><br />Overall	 Voyager was a bit hit and miss. The sixth season seemed to be one good one followed by one less than good one. The two episodes set in the Holographic Irish village are horrible! My perception of Seven of Nine was that she took over	 it all revolved around her	 which wasn't true. When she first appeared	 season 4 was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it evened out after that. And her character is ingenious at times	 20 years as a Borg drone gradually rediscovering her humanity. I like her	 especially in ""Someone to Watch Over Me	"" ""Imperfection	"" and ""Human Error."" When Naomi Wildman was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side	 that was lovely. Chakotay became my least favourite character. Gone was the chemistry with Janeway (will they/won't they?) and you'd never think he was first officer	 he's completely pushed aside most of the time. I loved seeing Tom and B'elanna's relationship blossom against the odds. I always liked Neelix a lot. Tuvok was good at times	 especially when he lost his logic	 gained emotion and was friends with Neelix. Harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times. The Doctor is probably my favourite	 seeing how far he comes and comedy situations he creates (""Tinker	 Tenor	 Doctor	 Spy"" is fantastic!).

"Before watching this film I had very low expectations and went to just see the cars. Eventually I even regretted going for that reason. Plot is almost non-existent. Character development is non-existent. So many clichés and so much jaw-dropping cheesiness existed in the movie that I could only stare and wonder how it was even released. If not for the exotics	 I wouldn't have even rated this movie a 1. An attempt at a coherent story line is destroyed by the sheer absurdity of this elite racing cult and the laughable characters that make up its members. In fact	 the movie's plot is so predictable and simple-minded that an average child could foretell the majority of the storyline. Bad acting	 bad plot	 bad jokes	 bad movie.<br /><br />Don't see it. Play Gran Turismo HD instead and it'll satiate your thirst for fast sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste."	0.0
"Written by Stephen King	 but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film. A mother and son move into a small Indiana town with a secret. They are Sleepwalkers	 feline type creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; plus hints of incest.<br /><br />Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother. Others appearing are Madchen Amick	 Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery."	0.0
"this movie is ok if you like mindless action 	corny acting	 and a very small plot !The special effects are decent considering this movie is from the director of""Event Horizon"". The costumes are like something from a mad max movie .None of the soldiers talk 	so others tell them what to do.It eventually end up as a big shoot'em up movie with explosions all the place. I personally liked Russell better in ""tango and cash""""escape from la/new york"" and ""executive decision"". It must see this movie leave your mind at the door for a no brainer action science fiction movie!!"	1.0
"Way back in 1955	 the British made a comedy called Simon and Laura	 with Peter Finch and the brilliant Kay Kendall. To this day	 it stands as one of the finest examples of British comedy and	 more particularly	 about how television sitcoms become so popular. It was	 and is	 an excellent example also of self-referential cinema.<br /><br />So also Soapdish	 a film I'd never heard about until a few nights ago when I caught it on late TV. I was a bit dubious at first simply because comedy is so difficult to do well	 as you know.<br /><br />However	 I was pleasantly surprised and delighted to watch a very clever satire about daytime American TV. In fact	 it's been a while since I laughed so heartily. So	 if you like satire	 I'd recommend you see it.<br /><br />The main actors  Sally Field	 Kevin Kline	 Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty  quite simply do an excellent job	 revealing just how bitchy and shallow the business of acting is. As I watched it	 I kept thinking to myself: just how much of this bitchiness carries over into real life? That is	 if actors ever do have a real life? As you probably know	 Peter Sellers	 for example	 was notorious for hiding his true persona behind a multitude of characters	 so that nobody really knew the real person. So	 as I watched Sally Field playing Celeste Talbot playing Maggie	 I thought again about that earlier British film with Kay Kendall playing Laura playing a character in a TV sitcom opposite Peter Finch...<br /><br />Is it any wonder that some actors have nervous breakdowns? And that feeling was crystallized when Celeste finally confronts her daughter (Lori	 played by Elizabeth Shue) and	 in an emotional moment	 repeats the fictional lines she'd used	 on a prior episode of her daytime soap	 when confronting her fictional daughter in that show! Are you confused? Well	 it's not all like that	 but the dialog is stunning for originality	 comedy	 bitchiness	 anger	 depravity	 duplicity	 and even...love.<br /><br />The story? Well	 there are many stories in this film	 all interwoven	 and which all come together at the end (of course  but not like a Robert Altman film	 okay!)	 and not all of them are resolved finally. Life's not like that anyway	 right? The pace is almost frenetic	 and you really do have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the sight gags and subtle jokes. Spend the 97 minutes from your life and watch it; you won't regret the time usage.<br /><br />The rest of the cast all perform well	 although I've never taken much to Whoopi Goldberg. Perhaps the funniest exchanges are between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty and	 for my money	 the latter steals so many scenes from others	 she gets my vote as the outstanding player. I kid you not	 she gives the term bitch an entirely new face..."	1.0
"What an amazingly funny and original show. The cast starting with the hysterical Julie Brown(Homecoming Queen's Got A Gun) is just perfect. Add Amy Hill(All American Girl-Grandma Kim) who plays a lesbian who is always arguing with her partner and business partner(Asian restaurant-WOK-DON""T RUN) I have laughed harder during this show than any other I have ever seen(including Newhart-one of my all time favorite shows) If you like movies like Naked Gun and Airplane- you will love this series!! One of the best moments of the show is Cindy Williams playing herself. When she snubs Tammy at the dry cleaners	 Tammy finds a picture of Cindy Williams in her coat. The picture is of Cindy Williams doing an unmentionable act with a bowling pin-upside down. It is awesome to see an actress like Cindy Williams being able to play herself like this. Soap opera like with many surprise twists during its short run. I can only hope that this will someday be released on DVD with special many bonus special features. Funniest series I have ever seen!!!!"	1.0

"I saw this movie today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing rave reviews	 but I guess the critics were just sucking up to Willem Defoe and his wife (the director) who were present at the festival. It is definitely the slowest movie I have ever seen with numerous pointless	 ridiculously long scenes of nothing. Besides Defoe who was decent	 the acting of the two and a half other people in the movie	 Defoe's wife Giada included	 was ridiculously awful (how they cast the part of the salesgirl at the bakery is beyond me). This movie is pretty much plot less with a lame attempt to be abstract and off the wall. The only scene that stirred any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came from nowhere as if just to add some kind of shock value to the dullness that is this movie. Sorry for being so harsh	 but really this movie is a precious waste of time and money. I appreciate good indie cinema	 but this movie is not worthy of moviegoers' time."	0.0
"Repugnant Bronson thriller. Unfortunately	 it's technically good and I gave it 4/10	 but it's so utterly vile that it would be inconceivable to call it ""entertainment"". Far more disturbing than a typical slasher film."	0.0
Can only be described as awful. It is bad to start with and then gets even more bad. When you start you really have to watch it through because it is impossible to believe that it can get worse - but fear not because it does. Another poorly written script for a donkey director for no-talent offspring of past movie stars. It's hard to decide if the script is worse than the acting or whether the directing is worse than both. As for the hero - well he belts up everyone including one scene where he beats the living daylights out of the tough by swinging open the wardrobe door and smashing him against the window with it. And in another scene he gets thrown through a window and crashes 20ft onto concrete - doesn't even blink - then gets up immediately and gets stuck into the baddies. This is a really ridiculous movie. Lucky it only cost me $1 to hire.	0.0
"As a long-time fan of Superman from the comics	 through the 1950s series	 the first two of the Chris Reeves films and Lois & Clark	 and finally Smallville	 I was *really* hoping for something clever with ""Superman Returns"".<br /><br />Instead we got Lex Luthor making *another* attempt at real-estate conversion	 another Superman-beaten-up-while-wearing-kryptonite sequence	 and internal inconsistencies: he couldn't stop himself falling into the ocean when stuck with 6"" of kryptonite	 but when Lois breaks off 3"" of it	 *leaving the rest embedded in him*	 he can lift *a continent* into space?? Really	 the only hero in the story was Lois' partner - I can't remember his name off-hand. He did all kinds of life-saving	 heroic things with nothing but guts and skill - no superpowers	 no invulnerability...just a normal human.<br /><br />They keep making Superman so small. Why can't we have Superman battling Brainiac or fighting to save the universe from General Zod instead of Lex's petty schemes. Oh	 I forgot...they're doing that in Smallville.<br /><br />Yeah...I think I'll stick to Smallville...<br /><br />You probably should	 too..."	0.0

"I loved this movie. I'm a Mexican and was in the least offended by it. In fact	 I think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over Mexico. It's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse. It angers me to read in the news how killers	 kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells. We should have someone like Creasy	 Denzel Washington's character. A bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante. Kidnapping is flourishing industry down here (at least in the big cities). I actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one's Creasy did his fine job upon. That would be so marvelous (Sorry	 I am THAT resentful!). MAN ON FIRE is a gripping film that you can't miss. It might be hard on some of you	 if you aren't used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do that ALL the time while watching American movies) but the effort will be well worth it. Some of the editing is a bit fuzzy...kind of like TRAFFIC	 remember? (another brilliant take on how corrupt Mexico is). The movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half. I swear you'll be cheering as you watch Denzel Washington dispatch the wrong doers. His performance is nothing short of Excellent. The ending (no spoilers	 OK!!!) is a bit sad	 but I'm sure you'll like it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the year's best movies. A ""must own"" for a DVD collection! 9* out of 10"	1.0
"I first learned of the Wendigo many years ago in one of Alvin Schwartz's ""Scary Stories"" books: according to that story	 the Wendigo - after calling your name in the wind - drags you along	 and then pulls you up into the sky and pulverizes you. While it sounds like a pretty bizarre notion	 Schwartz's story turned it into a fairly coherent idea.<br /><br />The movie ""Wendigo"" doesn't. It basically consists of every horror flick cliché: family moves to new house and strange things start happening	 anyone who harms them is asking for it	 and everyone had better listen to the old Indian guy. I've seen this stuff so many times that I no longer bother to count.<br /><br />Anyway	 avoid it. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey on ""Malcolm in the Middle"") have done far better than this."	0.0
"This review is based on the dubbed Shock-o-Rama video released on an undeserving world in 2002. How bad is it? It's awful	 which is what a '1' represents on the IMDb scale--but it's much worse than that. It's nice to imagine that an original German-language print might improve matters--the comedic English-language dubbing isn't funny at all--but truthfully	 this is one of the worst amateur films of any genre you're likely to see. The zombies in the film are as slow and clumsy as ever	 and they don't seem to have the ability to speak or think about anything beyond their next meal. However	 they're also intelligent enough to operate chainsaws and malicious enough to know that western taboos about genitalia will no doubt enliven their dinner table conversation. George Romero's Land of the Dead posited a zombie nation that retained a shred of social coherence; here	 zombies are nothing more than an empty canvas for the perverse imaginings of director Andreas Schnaas. Utterly without redeeming social value	 and even worse	 entirely lacking as entertainment	 Zombie '90 is a bad joke on anyone who wastes money on it."	0.0
"This will be a different kind of review. I've seen this movie twice on TV and would like to have a copy because it talks about Panama City and the beach in the winter time which is my favorite time to be there. It was the first movie I'd seen by Ashley Judd and she was great and I've enjoyed every other thing I've seen her in. Sundance's reaction made an impression on me too	 as did the director	 Victor Nunez	 who has directed and written several movies about Florida. This movie speaks to me and I've seen nothing with which to compare it. The plot speaks less to me than the surroundings. Well	 I told you it would be a different kind of review."	1.0
"I saw this movie primarily to see Brooke Burke (as Jill)	 who I had meet briefly in LA at a modeling trade show	 in her first feature film. I was hoping to see more of her	 but thought she did very well acting her role. Since she is such a beautiful and poised TV host	 and model	 it was not surprising. I was left wondering why she was killed	 and what happened as a result. Maybe I just missed it.<br /><br />I wasn't really sure about the genre of this movie	 and although I liked the actors I felt like it was for a college audience. I tried to keep an open mind considering horror wasn't my favorite genre	 but felt like I had outgrown the gags. It seemed to drag out in some places	 leave you guessing in some places about what powers the evil professor had	 and	 like a lot of other films had an unsatisfying ending.<br /><br />Having written a couple of scripts	 I know a lot of this is difficult and may come down to personal opinions	 how many movies you have seen & studied	 and those you relate with at a point in time.<br /><br />In a nutshell	 I found it interesting	 but not a satisfying plot and ending for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) would have returned through the portal in the end and kicked everyone's ass that would be a satisfying ending and would earn a higher rating."	0.0

"Of course	 by any normal standard of film criticism	 Soldier is a very poor film indeed. Kurt Russell is a futuristic super soldier raised since birth to kill but then made obsolete after being bettered by a bunch of really super soldiers at a dangly hoop ruck that looks a bit like a Gladiators contest without the crash mats.<br /><br />Abandoned on a junk planet	 he's befriended by a community of naff space hippies that teach him about gardening	 family life and	 um	 breasts. Kurt doesn't talk much. Finally the really super soldiers turn up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back while they're running away. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. A planet gets totalled. The end.<br /><br />Unless the Academy start a new category for ""Best Explosion""	 Soldier is not going to win any awards. However	 as ludicrous as it is	 it remains an enjoyable experience. The military hardware is the coolest since Aliens (the APC's especially) and	 at 90 minutes long	 it doesn't outstay its welcome.

"I saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel and thought it was wonderful	 especially since it was based on a true man. Pierce Brosnan was very good as the loner English man who took on the persona of the half breed Grey Owl. The photography was beautiful.<br /><br />This movie made me do more research into this character Archie Belaney known simple as Grey Owl. I want to read as much as I can about him. At the time I did not know Richard Attenborough had directed it. But I am not surprised. I like all his movies whether he is acting or directing. I gave it the highest rating. However	 I would have liked to have seen more in the movie about WHY he took on this persona as it only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in their house.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing foul language and contrived special effects every few minutes."	1.0
"Jewish newspaper reporter Justin Timberlake (as Joshua ""Josh"" Pollack) is puzzled when a courtroom defendant whispers ""Thank you"" to testifying officer LL Cool J (as Rafe Deed) as he leaves the witness stand.

You will see Mr. Cool J's devilish detective partner Dylan McDermott (as Frances ""Laz"" Lazerov) decide NOT to murder Damien Dante Wayans (as Isaiah Charles). The cops in the city of ""Edison"" are so corrupt they shoot their suspects	 steal their money	 and snort their dope.

"Such a long awaited movie.. But it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day.. From the trailers it looked like a action movie	 but it turned out to be a out & out comedy(a bad comedy). But one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors	 they've done their part of the movie very well. Good acting	 but i don't think that can save the movie..

Nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when I could go there ;-)<br /><br />Action sequences were shot very shabbily	 no one could make out head & tail of the stunts	 they've used Akki(akshay kumar) very well but could've been done much much better..<br /><br />Animation is the worst i've seen in recent movies(90's movies had better animation scenes i guess(initial scene where the car is falling off 'flying should be better word' the road into lake).<br /><br />And the movies name has been mentioned nearly every 20 to 30 mins	 just to make sure audiences don't forget the movie name i guess.."	0.0

"Those of the ""Instant Gratification"" era of horror films will no doubt complain about this film's pace and lack of gratuitous effects and body count. The fact is	 ""The Empty Acre"" is a good a example of how independent horror films should be done.<br /><br />If you avoid the indie racks because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty somethings getting killed by some baddie whose back-story could have come off the back of a Count Chocula box	 ""The Empty Acre"" is the movie for you.<br /><br />Set in the decaying remnants of the rural American dream	 ""The Empty Acre"" is the tale of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six-month-old baby. As the couple's weak relationship falls apart	 a larger story plays out in the background. At night	 a shapeless dark mass seethes from a sun baked barren acre on their farm and seemingly devours anything in its path	 leaving no sign that it was ever there.<br /><br />The film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues as to what is happening	 and ends with a well executed ending that resonates with just enough left over questions to validate the writer/director's faith in an intellectual audience.<br /><br />There seems to be a sub-text concerning the death of the American dream	 but I would hardly call the film an allegory.

"All day now I've been watching dinosaurs	 and all day they've had the same fundamental problem.<br /><br />They don't believe in firearms. They just don't seem to have been _told_ about them or something. Bullets _bounce_ off of dinosaurs! Maybe it's because they became extinct millions of years before the invention of gunpowder	 and the laws of physics were just different back then... Aah	 no. Come on. If they're close enough to chemically operate today	 they'd have to be vulnerable to fast (even subsonic) lead projectiles. It's that simple.<br /><br />Look	 the toughest-skinned reptiles on the planet today	 alligators and crocodiles	 are completely vulnerable to basic rifle fire. They're nothing magic. You can shoot a pistol round right through the heavy scales on their backs. They don't take armor-piercing bullets or anything special. Small bullets penetrate them	 they just don't kill them. Somewhat (but not REALLY) large bullets are preferred because the challenge (as with most game) is to kill the animal with one shot	 so it doesn't run. (Hunters consider it immoral to allow prey to run off and die unharvested.)<br /><br />Most animals	 including predators	 are easily repelled by gunfire. Between the noise	 and the pain of even a non-lethal wound	 most will run away. An exception are big bears	 which are so fearless that they're merely enraged by mortal wounds. Cape buffalo are regarded as highly dangerous because they are well known to charge when wounded. We've seen video of the big bulls of a herd of cape buffalo rescuing a calf from an entire pride of lions. A big cat will run if it can	 but if it can't it will charge as a final act of desperation. Where a T.Rex would fit in this spectrum is unknown. Their behavior simply has not been observed. With these larger animals	 safe hunting becomes a matter of applying an appropriately large and powerful projectile	 and/or applying several of them rapidly enough to counter its charge. With a T.Rex	 of course	 this could be a serious problem. I've seen a T.Rex skull (they have one in the museum downtown) and carrying a gun big enough to bust that might be impractical. Chewing its neck off with lots of smaller fire might be a more viable approach. Small bullets would still _penetrate_ them	 they wouldn't just bounce off just because the animal is too big to easily kill! <br /><br />So here we have Cortez and his men (this is _before_ the famous Mexican campaign	 apparently) captured by American natives and scheduled for sacrifice on the pyramid. It appears that all those human sacrifices were about appeasing the bloodthirst of the pair of T.Rexes that terrorized the continent in the day. Rather than just having their hearts cut out and being fed to the lizards	 Cortez et al talk the Aztecs into letting them hunt & kill them. OK	 maybe they don't have M-16s like the guys in the ""Carnosaur"" series	 but they _do_ have flintlocks	 crossbows	 pointed sticks (big ones	 made from trees) and swords. Maybe that's a little less uneven than squads of soldiers with full auto	 but they've several guys and I'd quickly bet on them over a dinosaur. Oh	 wait	 there's a _cannon_	 about a 4-incher. That's just the ticket for busting a Tyrannosaurus' skull! So they lay a trap	 with a squad of men	 cannon	 pointed sticks in a ravine	 and lure the first T.Rex into it	 using a pretty brown girl as bait. Cortez points out that they'll NOT have time to reload	 so they'll have to close the range until they can be certain of their aim. T.Rex totally ignores their volley of flintlock fire	 and we see both a crossbow bolt _and_ the cannon ball _bounce_ off! Forget it. End of credibility. A crossbow bolt would defeat Cortez' torso armor	 and a 4"" cannon ball might penetrate the hull of a wooden ship! This would also _certainly_ get through the hide	 ribcage	 or skull of any animal ever to walk this planet. (Do you think a _whale_ could withstand a 4"" cannon ball?) And here's T.Rex	 still standing	 not even bleeding. So Cortez lures it to the ravine	 where it falls onto the pointed sticks	 which (I guess by magic) penetrate it and kill it. Yaaay	 pointed sticks! <br /><br />The dinos aren't completely invulnerable to gunfire - they manage to put out an eye of the second one with a pistol. This runs it off	 so it's NOT as mean as a bear or a buffalo	 at least in the movies.<br /><br />They kill the second dinosaur with a bomb - made from a gourd filled with gunpowder and gemstones. My money would still be on the cannon. It's engineered function is to concentrate all the gunpowder's energy in one direction - toward the target. A bomb is a much more diffused application of force. A _real_ bomb (NOT a gourd bomb) has a steel casing which contains the explosion to extremely high pressure. (Think: pipe bomb vs firecracker.) A pile of gunpowder set on fire will simply go POOF. (Trust me on that one.)"	0.0
"It's depressing to see where Jackie Chan has ended up. He used to be an unstoppable hurricane of punches	 kicks and incredible stunts. To be fair	 he's now in his fifties and one would expect some slowdown. But with 'Rush Hour 3'	 where he takes a back seat to Chris Tucker (of all people!)	 and then there's 'Kung Fu Panda' where not only is he in a purely vocal role but his character barely has any dialogue... to say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a colossal understatement.<br /><br />It's times like this when the only solution is to whip out a dusty old VHS tape and watch Jackie kick some arses in his younger	 fitter	 Chris Tucker-free days.<br /><br />Enter 'Police Story'. Jackie Chan plays Kar-kui	 a policeman whose task it is to protect a witness before a major trial. He faces resistance from both the unco-operative witness and the numerous hit men sent by the mob to silence them both.<br /><br />But on the other hand	 who cares? We don't watch Jackie Chan films for the story. We watch them to see Jackie Chan perform eye-popping stunts and generally punch and kick a whole lot of people who are less awesome than he is.<br /><br />And on that level	 'Police Story' doesn't disappoint at all. There is an awesome showdown in a shopping mall at the end that culminates in Jackie sliding down a giant	 high-voltage chandelier. Seriously	 if this sort of thing happened more often	 no male would ever need coaxing to go shopping for clothes.<br /><br />There is also comedy	 much of which involves Kar-kui inadvertently upsetting May (Maggie Cheung)	 his eternally suffering and apparently ever forgiving girlfriend. The humour on the whole is pretty unsubtle	 but it works so I'm not complaining.<br /><br />The acting isn't too subtle	 either. Indeed	 I'm not sure there was anything subtle about 'Police Story' at all. Director Jackie Chan (yeah	 he does that too) clearly has a deep understanding of why we watch his films	 and knows that while we're waiting for the next fight to start	 the last thing we want is to be looking for nuance and depth and inner meaning.<br /><br />So 'Police Story' is a blast. As is the case with most of his films	 the fact that Jackie actually does the stuff you see on the screen puts it head and shoulders above the competition. I mean	 when Jackie Chan really is hanging from a speeding bus by an umbrella	 a whole new ""Wow!"" factor is added to the action."	1.0

"An utterly beautiful film	 one of a handful of I saw when young that entranced me then and still do	 in Thief's case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time. By the '90's my daughter and I had seen it many times on TV but still went to the pictures when it came to the local art-house cinema  when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and Miklos Rozsa's stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again.<br /><br />Idealistic Prince Ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out	 but evil Vizier Jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne. After escaping with a little thief played by Sabu	 Ahmad spots a Princess and they fall blindingly in love  along the way they have many adventures (although apparently not enough for Sabu!) and Love not only conquers but annihilates everything. The special effects must have been mesmerising in 1940	 but Time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action  but they still hold up well compared against films like Superman from 40 years later. Anyway	 if I'm requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies	 flying horses and carpets I also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects! Favourite bits: the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when Ahmad reveals himself and Adelaide Hall's suitably romantic song; the stunning colours in the tent in the Land Of Legend  in fact	 the stunning colours throughout; Sabu and Rozsa's triumphant but still wistful finale. Conrad Veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever	 this and Casablanca	 and then died. John Justin and June Duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers	 both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted	 but the parts didn't call for a huge range of emotions: only pure love mattered.<br /><br />There's a couple of mildly violent images in it	 but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a 100% positive message	 it's only a pity that nowadays little kids don't watch this instead of the porn they prefer. One of my Top 10 film favourites	 I can't recommend this too much  may it be shown to the end of Time."	1.0
"I wondered why I didn't like Peggy Sue Got Married more than I did	 when it first came out in 1986	 with all the hype. Somehow I found Nic Cage's character off-putting. Way off-putting. Then the plot didn't seem to make sense. Then by the end of the credits	 the question came to mind: What point was this movie making? What was it saying? The answer	 unfortunately	 was not much	 if anything. I really don't think this movie aimed at making a statement; unless it was ""your life is your life	 you're gonna make the same mistakes no matter what	 so keep your eye upon the doughnut	 and not the hole"". Not a very profound statement	 and I'm sorry	 not profoundly made in this movie. The writing simply isn't that good. The direction is uneven	 and is strangely overblown at times. Kathleen Turner was the best	 and in my opinion	 only worthwhile thing in this movie	 and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre	 unexplained circumstances	 with a script that had no apparent statement to make. <br /><br />She also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason I didn't enjoy this movie more. She states in her autobiography that Cage made a point of fighting his uncle Coppola's direction every step of the way	 doing it ""his own way"" (not a good idea for a new actor)	 and putting on a goofy voice she called ""stupid"". His voice was annoying	 abrasive and unnatural	 and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy. I understand what he was attempting to do: play a young-guy ""hot shot"" who is not as hot as he thinks he is	 setting up his own karma for future failure. But he goes overboard	 the way he does it is abrasive	 not effective	 and if he had listened to his uncle instead of ""fighting the Man""	 we would have had a more enjoyable film. Cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person	 and those scenes are more watchable than others. But if I had to watch the movie through in its entirety	 I would find myself wanting to pay someone in L.A. to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected (put-on) scenes. <br /><br />The movie doesn't aim for a statement	 doesn't make a point	 is great to look at except when Cage is doing a demented Elvis impression (but without the voice)	 and is	 ultimately	 confusing and a waste of time. Given all this	 Kathleen Turner surely deserved an Oscar in this flailing mess of a movie. I can't recommend anyone spending two hours watching this	 unless you like Turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes. Believe me	 you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes	 and it will make just as much sense. <br /><br />Kathleen Turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her Cage comments	 which proves that she's strong enough to be honest	 and to hell with other people's comments. You go	 Turner! I'm not particularly a fan of this actress any more than I am of any other first-rate actor or actress	 but her candor is refreshing. Cage's acting can be good to annoying	 and here it doesn't work. At least	 in this film	 now we know why."	0.0
"The actual crime story at the core of In Cold Blood might seem a little 'tame' for those who are weened on the classic serial killer stories (Gein	 Bundy	 Dahmer)	 or just the more notorious cases out in Hollywood (OJ	 Manson). The essential facts in the case don't amount to anything terribly convoluted: Perry Smith and Dick Hickock (here played by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson respectively) met by some luck	 conspired to rob a man's farmhouse safe out in Kansas	 and after killing a family of four with a shotgun and dagger came away with 43 dollars. Aside from their returning to the US after fleeing briefly to Mexico	 there isn't a whole lot of mystery to the resolution either. They were caught by some stroke of ironic chance (a cop followed them and stopped them for having a stolen car after Smith and Hickcock helped out a boy and his old man collecting bottles for change)	 and sentenced to hang by the neck until dead. The story ended in 1965.<br /><br />But it's the handling of the story	 moments of moot	 the performances	 a pure cinematic touch that Brooks and his absolutely marvelous (the late/great) DP Conrad Hall provides in crisp widescreen black and white	 and a storytelling style that feels realistic without going into too much naturalism or too much melodrama (save perhaps for near the end	 which is pitch perfect). The air of tragedy hangs over the story	 and not so much because of the killings themselves	 no matter how brutal they are as the ""third"" man that is conjured up	 as the narrator observes	 by Smith and Hickcock teaming up	 but because of the inevitability of the story. You feel somehow for these criminals	 who in any other hands would be just be conventional figures or something out of a B-movie. These aren't good people	 but they aren't necessarily monsters either	 at least all the way through.<br /><br />It's also an excellent 'road-movie' as we see Smith and Hickcock on the road down to the Clutter residence (the actual night-time scene of the crime taking place late in the film)	 then on to Mexico	 then back to America towards Las Vegas. We get to soak in the personalities of these two	 probably even more than that of the police detectives who at first have no leads and then finally get a break with an inmate. It's actually kind of disturbing to get this close to these two (sort of akin to the aimless quality of Malick's Badlands characters)	 and it's also a sign of daring for the period. There's no sermonizing	 like ""he did this because of that and this or the other."" We see how Smith had an abusive	 psychotic father	 but that Smith loved and hated him. The complexity there is too much for the movie	 maybe even too much for Capote's book (which	 I should confess	 I've still yet to read	 though I plan to). And we see Hickcock is this creature of slick confidence (i.e. getting the suit and other things with bad checks)	 but without any deep-rooted explanation to it all.<br /><br />The streak of fatalism in In Cold Blood is some of the starkest of the 60s	 and it's the luck of Brooks to have its stars as Blake in his top-of-the-pops performance (this and Lost Highway	 oddly enough considering his real life saga in recent years	 his quintessential pieces of work)	 and Wilson's breakthrough before becoming a character actor. While they're surrounded by fine supporting work	 they themselves are eerily absorbing	 driven more or less by greed and fantasies of escapism with treasure	 and staying pretty much grounded in their situation through the death row and on through their ends. Is this a morale of the story	 if there could be one	 that it's more horrifying to confront the possibility that those who kill can't be classified	 of good vs evil getting smudged? Smith apologized for his crime before being hung	 and he points out	 ""but to who?"" This is a story bound to give the most hardened fans of true-crime the bonafide chills	 and it's quite possibly the best American film of 1967."	1.0
"When my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film	 I know it is bad. I wanted to claw my eyes out. I wanted to reach through the screen and slap Mike Myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had. This is one of the few films in my life I have watched and immediately wished to ""unwatch""	 if only it were possible. The other films being 'Troll 2' and 'Fast and Furious'	 both which are better than this crap in the hat.<br /><br />I may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget I ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good Seuss name.<br /><br />To Mike Myers	 I say stick with Austin or even resurrect Waynes World. Just because it worked for Jim Carrey	 doesn't mean Seuss is a success for all Canadians.<br /><br />"	0.0
"Ok first of all	 this movie sucks. But lets examine why. The proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy	 storing it	 and then transporting it and reasembling it is at the least intriguing. But that's as far as they take this premise. Instead of delving into what could happen if someone made this kind of machine	 they break the damn thing. This could have been a good premise. Living with the responsibilty of this kind of power	 and dealing with the constant temptation	 ie.. the invisible man. But no.. they break the damn thing. And Lembach wants to leave. So then the doctor jerry-rigs the thing back together	 and trys to transport himself. Only to have it goofed up by his beautiful but dumb secretary	 (duh). Which wouldn't happened if Lembach hadn't decided to leave. So now he is roaming the country side killing people because his little experiment failed	 and they wouldn't give him money. Wah. Then to make the movie worse	 throw in a dry British relationship between the two semi-competent professors hired to assist him. Between their loving sessions	 they make a couple of half-hearted attempts to find him while he kills off half of London. All of this could have been headed off by not breaking the damn machine	 which would never have happened if Lembach hadn't left. This movie tried so I give it an honest 2 stars for effort	 but it would have been better if they hadn't broke the damn machine	 making Lembach leave	 making him try it again. Damn you Lembach!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"	0.0
"This film features Ben Chaplin as a bored bank employee in England who orders a mail order bride from Russia	 recieves Nicole Kidman in the mail and gets more than he bargained for when	 surprise	 she isn't what she appears to be. The story is fairly predictible and Chaplin underacts too much to the point where he becomes somewhat anoying. Kidman is actualy rather good in this role	 making her character about the only thing in this film that is interesting. GRADE: C"	0.0
"To my surprise	 I really enjoyed Disney's latest animation installment. The Film had its lows	 but overall I felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate to. It was also pleasant to see an Animated Disney film that was not a musical. I was about pushed to the limits with Tarzan. Thankfully they gave the music thing a rest. Another nice feature about the film is that the comedy was not completely dumbed down (a la Hercules)	 rather subtle so it still made the kids laugh while not make the adults feel giddy or just plain stupid.<br /><br />One disappointment was the animation. With all the great animated films happening outside Disney studios	 you would think they would move along and catch up a little. There is something to say about tradition	 but imagine the possibilities with the story of Atlantis! Overall the film was entertaining	 and definitely worth a trip to the multiplex.<br /><br />"	1.0
"The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved. I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made. I love all six of the Stooges (Curly	 Shemp	 Moe	 Larry	 Joe	 and Curly Joe)! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team! <br /><br />One of My favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is none other than Husbands Beware! All appearing in this short are the beautiful Christine McIntyre	 Dee Green	 Doris Houck	 Alyn Lockwood	 Johnny Kascier	 Nancy Saunders	 Lu Leonard	 Maxine Gates	 and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre provide great performances here! There are so many funny parts here. This is a very hilarious short. There is another similar Three Stooges short like this one called Brideless Groom and I recommend both!"	1.0
"Thelma Ritter did steal the picture. I just finished watching it again. I couldn't help becoming emotional in her final scene. She didn't get the Oscar. That's why you shouldn't put too much faith in Oscars. Richard Widmark never had a better part and was perfect casting as a 3-D	 flawed human being. Jean Peters was great as the streetwise	 tough girl in her best role ever. And Richard Kiley must have been very good; why else would I have hated him so. Yes	 it was heavy handed on the patriotism; but	 without it	 you don't have much of a film. Watch their faces! The top three stars didn't really need much script. I would like to have seen them do this film without dialogue. If you've ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in ""The Thief""	 maybe you know what I mean. When I was a kid in 1956 on my first trip to NYC	 I made my Bronx uncle drive us to the foot of South Street looking for No. 66. That's when I knew that Hollywood couldn't be trusted. But I did find the river.<br /><br />I'm not giving away much of the story because I hate it when I know what happens before I see it for myself. If you have seen it	 no elucidation is necessary. Just maybe	 someone who is reading these comments hasn't seen ""Pickup On South Street"". You will like it; just don't go looking for 66 South Street in New York City."	1.0
"This	 along with ""Hare Tonic	"" ranks as one of the best Bugs cartoons	 indeed one of the best Bugs	 ever. There are some comments about how Bugs in these cartoons is ""basic	"" meaning	 I guess	 that he is as yet not fully developed. I actually prefer this ""basic"" version from the mid-40s (Chuck Jones' was the best version) who is actually more rabbit-sized and far more amusing than the eventual long-legged version who towered over Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck. The latter-day Bugs came to be too suave and sophisticated for my liking. Also check out ""Hair Raising Hare"" (1946) and ""Rabbit Punch"" (1948) for great examples of classic Bugs and classic Chuck Jones."	1.0
"After being sent to prison for no less then 10 nor more then 40 years for being busted with drugs and refusing to give up her accomplishes	 Jackie (Erica Gavin of Russ Meyer's ""Vixen"" and ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls""	 in her last film role) has to get accustomed to life in the big 'doll' house	 or at least try to	 in this early film by Jonathan Demme. Due to it's tawdry nature and sheer watchability	 I would also rank this as one of his best films	 right below ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Stop Making Sense""	 but so far above any of his other movies. This minor classic is just campy	 sleazy	 and fun enough to be an amazingly good guilty pleasure and thankfully never once goes overboard into all out parody of the Women In Prison genre. It ALMOST washed out the rancid bad taste of the ludicrously preachy ""Philidelphia"" from my mouth. However	 the film is not without it's downfalls (the 'un'talent show is a HUGE chore to sit through and goes on far too long	 Barbera Steele is sadly wasted	 among other small things) But don't let those gripes stop you from watching an otherwise enjoyable movie.<br /><br />My Grade: B- <br /><br />DVD Extras: 5 minute Roger Corman interview; Cast & crew Bios; Original Trailer; and Trailers for ""Candy Stripe Nurses"" (with nudity)	 ""Big Bad Mama 2""	 ""Big Doll House"" (with nudity)	 & ""Crazy Mama"" <br /><br />Eye Candy: Juanita Brown	 Cheryl ""Rainbeaux"" Smith	 Erica Gavin	 Roberta Collins	 Ella Reid	 Lynda Gold	 and some others all show skin"	1.0
"The shame of it! There I was	 comfortable in the arm chair with a beer and a bag of popcorn	 bouyant in the hope of another splendid Muppet night of entertainment. What did I get? Disappointed! How can the Muppets go from the sublime Christmas Carol to this? The humour was dreadful	 the songs were worse than Country and Western (and that's saying something) and the plot was as confused and poor as Blind Pew. I think the main problem was that they bit off too much in attempting Treasure Island. A short tale	 such as Christmas Carol	 is perfect because you can weave the Muppet high jinks around it....here the need to drag the plot along stopped all the fun. Where do the Muppets go next? How about Muppets Wizard of Oz?"	0.0
"I just saw this movie last night and	 being someone who had very low expectations to begin with	 was still disappointed. The most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point (the guy being awake during the surgery)	 had NOTHING to do with the outcome. It would have ended the same way regardless. So	 what was the point of this? Who knows. Also	 this surgeon had 4 malpractice suits against him and he didn't think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table? Give me a break. Jessica Alba is completely talentless and Christiansen is almost as bad. The whole thing was just laughable from start to finish. I'm fairly certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a scalpel	 you would be in more pain than that."	0.0
"Set in 2017 (although one might easily mistake it for 1987	 judging by the hairstyles and clothing)	 The Running Man sees all-round good guy Ben Richards (Schwarzeneggar) framed for a crime he didn't commit. After a daring prison break	 he is captured and entered as a contestant in the brutal TV game show The Running Man	 along with some fellow escapees and the pretty token female	 Amber (Maria Conchita Alonso)	.<br /><br />Used by the totalitarian government as a way of controlling the masses	 the show pits convicts against a range of colourful (and often quite camp) opponents	 each having his own unique killing style: Dynamo fires electricity from a special suit	 Buzzsaw uses chainsaws	 Sub Zero has a razor edged ice hockey stick	 and Fireball prefers a flamethrower to finish off contenders. But these killers are no match for Ben Richards	 who dispatches each one in a fittingly gruesome manner (followed by the obligatory witticism).<br /><br />Towards the end of the movie	 Ben joins a group of freedom fighters in a battle against the authorities	 and gets to exact revenge on the show's nasty host	 Killian.<br /><br />Twenty years ago	 Arnold Schwarzeneggar ruled the action-movie universe and	 to his legion of fans	 he could do no wrong. The Austrian beefcake had a successful formula that almost guaranteed box office success for his movies: comic book violence plus logic-free plot plus pretty female sidekick plus witty one-liners	 minus acting ability equalled massive profits. The Running Man faithfully followed this blockbuster recipe to a T and Arnie's (mostly male teenage) audience lapped it up (myself included).<br /><br />Now	 two decades later	 and having just finished re-watching the movie for the first time in years	 I find it a strange movie: one totally devoid of technical merit	 decent acting	 and convincing effects	 yet somehow totally entertaining. Directed by Paul Michael Glaser (best known as Det. Dave Starsky from cult 70s cop show	 Starsky and Hutch)	 and adapted from a short story by Stephen King (writing under the nom de plume	 Richard Bachman)	 The Running Man is cheesy 80s tat that looks both incredibly cheap and very dated	 yet despite (or maybe because of) the film's shoddiness	 it has a special charm which is hard to describe.<br /><br />With no attempt at creating a realistic near-future setting	 the film provides plenty of unintentional giggles. Check out the scene in which Ben discovers Amber's secret cache of forbidden cassette tapes(!); marvel at the crap 'futuristic' graphics used on advertising billboards and The Running Man board game (as a graphic designer	 I found these particularly amusing); be amazed at the distinct lack of convincing technological advancements.<br /><br />The Running Man may be utter rubbish	 but it is hugely entertaining utter rubbish that I have no hesitation in recommending to fans of Arnie and sci-fi action in general."	1.0
"There are lots of extremely good-looking people in this movie. That's probably the best thing about it. Perhaps that even makes it worth watching.<br /><br />""Loaded"" tells the story of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe)	 a young man who's about to make his mark on the world. He's the son of a well-to-do family with a good reputation	 and he's on his way to law school. But like so many such settings	 things aren't quite as perfect as they appear. The expectations in this family far outweigh the love. Except for school	 Tristan's father rarely lets him leave the house. This seems to be the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family	 which is partially revealed through flashbacks but isn't spelled out until the very end. Tristan's claustrophobic environment causes him to let loose in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity	 when his friends take him out to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach house party	 and from there	 Tristan befriends Sebastian Cole (Corey Large)	 who pulls him into a drug dealing underworld.<br /><br />While technically well-made	 this movie suffers from a lackluster script and a storyline that isn't very engaging. Also counting against this film are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and out-of-place	 such as slow-motion	 fast-motion	 freeze-frames and echos. These are the types of effects a director might normally utilize to show a character's perspective while on drugs	 except in this case they seem to have been sporadically tossed in at random points	 in some cheap attempt at style.<br /><br />Despite its cast of relative unknowns	 performances were good all around	 most notably with respect to the main antagonist (Corey Large). I suspect we'll be seeing at least a couple of these people in bigger and better projects in the future.<br /><br />Of course	 when mentioning the actors	 I must mention their looks. Rating based on hotness	 this movies scores an 11. The women in this movie are incredible-looking and almost distract you from what a boring movie you're watching. I'm sure the male characters are also quite attractive	 but you'll have to ask someone else to comment on that.<br /><br />Overall	 I can't recommend this movie	 not for buying	 renting	 or even seeing for free. It's unfortunately just not worth the effort it takes to sit through."	0.0
"At last! A decent British comedy that isn't centred around some mockney bank robbers or spun off from a TV series. John Ivay's film is a psychoactive tale of discovery	 dressed in biker gear. The three protagonists are gentle fools with a penchant for failure and each at a turning point in their lives	 giving a sensitive	 emotional trio of sub-plots to sew the riotous comedy together. The chemistry between the three amigos is palpable and makes for a touching companionship with hilarious dialogue and some classic comedic moments. It feels part Withnail and I	 part American Werewolf in London	 and part Quadraphenia (but only because of the bike gangs	 and Phil Daniels). In fact	 Phil Daniels' lovable rogue reminds you of Danny the dealer in Withnail and I	 with his scholarly approach and scientific commitment to drugs. This is a great film	 particularly for those who've dabbled in psychoactive substances in the past	 who will relate to many moments in the film. A personal favourite is the brilliant scene in the Welsh corner shop	 buying munchies while tripping on 'shrooms. This gentle comedy will warm the cockles of your heart and have you laughing out loud. And you don't have to ride bikes or even like them to enjoy it. But it'll add to it if you do. Brilliant."	1.0
"MacArthur is a great movie with a great story about a great man General Douglas MacArthur. This is of course	 the story of one of America's great military figures	 and a figure made familiar to me from the earliest moments of my memory. Though there is a continuity issue (there may be others) e.g. MacArthur's speech portrayed in the film as his 1962 address to the U.S. Military Academy on accepting the Thayer award did not contain the phrase ""old soldiers never die; they just fade away."" (That was in his speech to Congress upon his dismissal by President Truman) in 1951 for his alleged insubordination (these two did not see eye to eye!) Gregory Peck is im-Peck-able as the general who vowed he would return to the Philippines in World War II. The film moves quickly and easily with the General	 his family and his staff from the beginning of the Second World War to the end of his service career. This film would be of much greater significance to one familiar with both WW II and the Korean War. Nevertheless	 Peck's portrayal of this great man who fought the twin evils of fascism and communism and who hated war as only a soldier can is a memorable one indeed. ""In war there is no substitute for victory."""	1.0
"Okay	 my title is kinda lame	 and almost sells this flick short. I remember watching Siskel & Ebert in '94 talking about this movie	 and then playing a clip or two. Not being a rap-conscious guy (although I could identify Snoop Dogg	 Vanilla Ice	 and MC Hammer music)	 I wasn't much interested when they started talking about the film. But then	 S&E showed the scene where the band explains how they picked their name (using some ""shady"" logic and a bunch of ""made up"" facts)	 and then another scene where the band	 and their rival band	 both visit a school to promote getting involved (and	 of course	 NWH comes up with some ""info"" about how the rival band leader is a loser because he got good grades in school and was on the yearbook committee). So I filed it away that I should see this movie.<br /><br />A couple of years later	 this thing shows up on HBO and I recorded it	 only to laugh my butt off for hours. Yes	 it has a ""Spinal Tap"" kind of rhythm to it...even the documentarist takes essentially the same ""tone"" in setting up the clips	 and the band follows a similar path (what I now call the ""Behind the Music"" phenomenon - smalltime band has good chemistry	 gets famous	 too much money too fast	 squabbling	 drugs	 some type of death	 band breaks up	 then reconciles	 finishing with a hope for more albums in the future	 and fade to black). The one thing that is true is that in Spinal Tap	 you catch the band perhaps with a little more success in their past. But Tap drags at some points	 and in my mind is reduced to laughs that are set up by specific scenes. Oh	 this is his rant about the backstage food	 this is spot where he wants the amp to go to ""ELEVEN""	 this is the spot where the guy makes the pint-sized stonehenge	 etc...<br /><br />Contrasting to FoaBH	 which seems to have more ""unexpected"" humor. You can see some of it coming	 but there isn't a big setup for every joke. Sometimes	 the jokes just kinda flow. Cundieff and the other actors in the band had a real chemistry that worked. Also	 the direct references to Vanilla Ice	 Hammer	 and a bunch of other caricature-type rappers really worked well. This strikes me as a film you watch once to get the main story and laughs	 and then go back and watch to catch the subtle jokes. And the songs. Is ""My Peanuts"" better than ""Big Bottom"" (from Spinal Tap)? I don't know - but they're both damn funny. Tone Def's awful video during his ""awakening"" phase is so bizarre	 yet so funny.<br /><br />I could go on awhile	 but save your time and don't waste it on CB4. I watched the first half hour	 and got bored. You don't get bored on FoaBH. There are slightly less funny moments	 but you can never tell when something good is about to happen. Perhaps my favorite scene is when Ice Cold and Tastey Taste (name ripoffs if I've ever heard any) discover they've been sharing the same girl....at one point	 you've got those two pointing guns at each other	 and the next thing you know	 the manager	 the photographer	 the girl	 and I think even Tone Def are in the room pointing guns at each other	 switching targets back and forth. And	 of course	 someone does get shot.<br /><br />I did find it odd that NWH's managers suffered similar fates to Spinal Tap's drummers (although none spontaneously combusted	 I don't think). There were enough similarities that I cannot ignore the likelihood that Cundieff saw ""Spinal Tap"" prior to writing this film	 although this is clearly much more the Spinal Tap of hip-hop. While some similarities exist	 the humor is different	 and the movie seems more like a real documentary (maybe because we don't recognize a single actor in this thing	 even the guy who played ""Lamar"" from ""Revenge of the Nerds""). All in all	 this movie has	 in my opinion	 ""street cred"". Kinda like NWH."	1.0
"Paris is the place to be to enjoy beautiful art and music	 and to fall madly in love - as is the case in this film.

"Andy Goldsworthy is a taoist master of the first order	 expressing the Way through his sublime ephemeral art. Indeed	 time and change is what his work is fundamentally about. I bought his first book several years ago and my family has marveled at it many times. So it was a treat to get to know the artist personally through this film	 he is just as patient and gentle as you would expect	 and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world	 the deepest of which are expressed in his occasional inability to say it in words at all. He is like most children who play in the great outdoors alone (if they do anymore)	 creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before they outgrow it. Mr. Goldsworthy was given the gift and the mission to extend that sort of play to create profound visions of nature	 and to open our often weary eyes to it in brilliant new ways. And always with the utmost respect	 gratitude and humor of a wandering	 and wondering monk."	1.0
"A masterful treatment of James Caine's ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" as Luchino Visconti's first film shot primarily around Ferrara in a soulless war-torn Italy. The original negative was thought destroyed but Visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neo-realist work today. A ruggedly handsome Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai (who had recently revealed her breasts in La Cena delle beffe"" (1941)	 star as the sensually-charged and ill-fated lovers who plot to kill her husband. Unusual ending in which	 although crime does not pay	 one pays in a way not directly linked to the crime. Excellent direction	 script	 acting	 and cinematography. Reportedly not as good as the French ""Le Dernier tournant' (1939) but probably better than the US version (1946) featuring Lana Turner and John Garfield in the lead roles. Highly recommended."	1.0
"The quality of this movie is simply unmatched by any baseball title of its time. Pam Dixon branches out in the film industry to recruit blue-chip prospects and make this work of art a must-see. Academy Award winners Brenda Fricker (Home Alone: Lost in New York	 A Time to Kill)	 Ben Johnson (The Last Picture Show	 Red Dawn)	 and Adrien Brody (The Pianist	 The Village) amplify the atmosphere of the movie	 drawing in an anxious audience. However	 the dramatic performances are neutralized by quirky radio broadcaster Jay O. Sanders (JFK	 The Day After Tomorrow).<br /><br />The story is centralized around a foster child	 up-and-coming actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Brick	 The Lookout). Sidekick Milton Davis Jr. delivers a tear-jerking performance as the longtime friend who never knew his parents. The two don't have much	 but what they do have: Angels' baseball	 and what they are seeking: identity. That's when 4-time Emmy Nominee Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon	 Predator 2) comes in to save the day as frustrated Angels Manager	 George Knox. In relation	 all characters in the story seem to have the same mission: search within themselves to find out who they really are.<br /><br />Depressed over the fact that Roger (JGL) is separated from his father	 he wishes to God for reunification if the Angels can take the pennant. Odds are astronomical	 but 3-time Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future	 My Favorite Martian) comes in as the omniscient overseer to work a little magic (pun). Before you know it	 Al (Lloyd) is sitting with Roger in the stands	 snacking on cracker jacks	 and causing some of baseball's biggest boners! Dorothy Kingsley and George Wells' (DK Oscar Nominee GW Oscar Winner) 1951 screenplay is done justice under the finger of mastermind William Dear (nominated in Directors Guild of America). He includes a touching side story centered around pitcher Mel Clark	 played by Tony Danza (4-time Golden Globe nominee	 Emmy nominee)	 who in relation to all other cast members is just trying to find his place in a confused Anaheim. Clark has been dubbed a wash-up	 a once big-name in Cinci	 but he has something to prove to Manager Knox.<br /><br />Spoiling this nail-biting plot would simply be the equivalent to committing adultery in the 18th century. This one is a diamond in the rough	 and it will keep you on the edge of the seat until all come to peace. Did I mention a cameo by Matthew McConaughey (A Time to Kill	 We Are Marshall) for all you ladies out there?"	1.0
"This is the official sequel to the '92 sci-fi action thriller. In the original	 Van Damme was among several dead Vietnam War vets revived to be the perfect soldiers (Unisols). In this one	 it's	 I guess	 about a dozen years later	 since Van Damme has a daughter about that age. Now he's working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest Unisols - codenamed Unisol 2500	 for some reason. As usual	 something goes wrong: the on-site super-computer (named Seth - like the snake in ""King Cobra"" the same year) goes power-crazy	 takes command of the Unisols	 and even downloads its computer brain into a new super-Unisol body (Jai White). We're lookin' at the next step in evolution	 folks! Most of Van Damme's fights are with one particularly mean Unisol (pro wrestler Goldberg) who just keeps on comin': drop him off a building - no good; run him down with a truck - no go! Shoot him	 burn him - forgetaboutit! Much of the humor is traced to how Van Damme is now outmoded and out-classed(he's even going grey around the edges). But	 though he takes a lickin'	 he keeps on kickin'! Most sequels of this sort are pretty lame - pale imitations of the originals	 and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius	 it manages to be consistently entertaining	 especially if you're a pro-wrestling fan."	0.0
"""Cement"" is a bad movie about a bad cop (Penn) with a bad attitude and a bad disposition who has a bad guy in a bad way up to his cajones in fast drying concrete. While we're waiting for the cement to dry and the film to figure out what it's about	 we're periodically jerked back in time without rhyme or reason so we can watch events leading up to the cement thing. A boring junk flick overall	 ""Cement"" suffers from lack of a story	 a clumsy execution	 and that most ubiquitous of filmdom's faults; no reason to care. A time killer for the needy couch potato at best. (D+)"	0.0
"Just after I saw the movie	 the true magic feeling of the Walt Disney movies came up in me and I realized me that it was a long time ago that I saw the 'real' magic in a movie.<br /><br />The combination of the right music	 speeches and magical effects brings the Disney feeling again into your body. Very special things I saw where the not-knowing effects in the movie	 started with the disney logo transforming into the Cinderella castle and ended as an old-story telling fairytale with your grandparents.<br /><br />The magic has returned in me. I rate this movie 8 out of 10."	1.0
"It has been almost 5 years since the release of this stylish action flick.I have watched this movie almost 10 times and it a great effort by Gautham.From my perspective	I feel this movie is virtually flawless. Surya as ACP Anbuchelvan-no doubt..classy.Jyothika played her role as Maya very well.The character suits her very well.The character that caught movie-goers attention was Pandia.Jeevan played the role of Pandia very well.Brutal and fearsome.Jeevan deservedly received the Best Villain award in the ITFA 2004.The supporting cast of Daniel Balaji	Devadharshini and other performed well.<br /><br />Racy screenplay	perfectly-timed dialogues and brilliant narration by Gautham.The soundtrack by Harris Jeyaraj are all chart-busters while the BGM suits the movie very well.Cinematography by R.D. Rajasekhar is rich.Peter Hein choreographed the stunts well.Anthony's editing is precise.Above all	Kaakha Kaakha is a perfect cop film filled with right doses of action and romance.<br /><br />Even some Hollywood film cant compete with Kaakha Kaakha...undoubtedly."	1.0
"Those individuals familiar with Asian cinema	 as a whole	 are aware that Japan is renowned	 or notorious	 for it's hyper-violent films and Korea is now garnering a reputation for viciously brutal films. Dog Bites Dog	 while not necessarily getting as hyper-violent as the craziest Miike film	 nor is it as unapologetically brutal as some Koreas more ambitious efforts	 it is a perfect in between with its own brand of brutality all it's own. The greatest strength this film has though	 like the greatest of the Japanese or Korean efforts	 is that the brutality	 rather than detracting from the film	 actually develops the characters	 if not	 pushing the story forward. The two main characters are both incredibly vicious individuals with their own motivations and emotional underpinning for being as such. Sam Lee's character	 for instance	 is on the edge from the very start and slowly and surely	 amidst various encounters with Chang's character	 it is revealed why he is. Without spoiling this part of the story too much	 it involves the morally ambiguous nature of his father. Chang's character	 on the other hand	 has his most primal instincts honed to	 if not perfection	 brutal efficiency. Surprisingly	 Chang's story arch	 while not necessarily revealing a more human side	 actually reveals a side to our animal nature which many forget about which is the natural ability to recognize a fellow broken animal (and no I am not talking about Sam Lee	 rather Pei Pei's garbage dump girl character). Ultimately however	 for the first 80 minutes or so	 it is a	 more or less	 straight forward cat and mouse	 or Dog chase Dog	 film in which every encounter ends in at least one death (seriously	 once Sam Lee and Chang Square off	 some one will die) and the fun part of movie is you never know who hands will commit the act. Which brings us to the film's one weakness. Unforunatley to delve into it would be yet another spoiler but	 to put it simply	 it is guilty of pushing one of the main points of the film since	 rather then letting the point be made as is 80 minutes into the film	 the film goes on for another 20 minutes or so to further emphasize it. Don't get me wrong	 if transitioned better from the 80 minute mark to the climax and if the final act wasn't filled with sweet music (in fact if it	 like the majority of the film	 kept the music to the barest minimum and let the disturbing sound effects do their job)	 it still could have worked and not detract from the film. As it is though	 despite the third act having the most vicious and bloody of the encounters	 the way it was handled made it feel tacked on	 and almost	 insults the viewers intelligence since it felt it had to go this far to get it across. Nevertheless	 it is still a breath of fresh air from Hong Kong cinema since even the most bloody of the martial arts films never reaches the level of viciousness and brutality while keeping the the character archs in tact."	1.0
"Turn your backs away or you're gonna get in big trouble out of MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK! Only a happy ending can bloom your innocence that is full of gloom and doom at the very moment you're watching this. It's safe to say that the entire movie falls apart	 with a sarcastic approach and tribute to zombie shows that defy nonsense to the max. We get a name like ""Johnny"" every so often	 and this ""Johnny"" has nowhere to go. There isn't a specific reason to why our ""dead corpse"" crawls out of his grave just to survive until prom night	 so that renders the movie totally useless. Without a feeling of sorrow	 his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he's dead. Johnny takes a bite out of Eddie's arm afterwards. The viewer is asked a tough question: Why does the movie have to be this cornball? There is an answer. Any resemblance to all persons living or dead is purely coincidental. ""Living"" is a coincidence. ""Dead"" has nothing in common with the movie. Show this one to your girlfriend and she'll skip the senior prom	 turning your life into a deserted ruin. Blah!!!"	0.0
"Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert. She gives her all every time she is on stage. Whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads	 Bette Midler moves her audience. If you can't see it live (which is the best way to see Bette) then this is the next best thing. An interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power. Her more ""vocally correct"" version of ""Stay With Me"" never loses anything in spirit from THE ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS	 Here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever. I will treasure this concert for a very long time."	1.0
Yesterday my Spanish / Catalan wife and myself saw this emotional lesson in history. Spain is going into the direction of political confrontation again. That is why this masterpiece should be shown in all Spanish High Schools. It is a tremendous lesson in the hidden criminality of fascism. The American pilot who gets involved in the Spanish Civil War chooses for the democratically elected Republican Government. The criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes that Uribe ever made. The colors are magnificent. The cruelty of a war (could anybody tell me the difference between Any war and a Civil war ?)is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other. The cowards that start their abuse of power even towards innocent children are now active again. A film like 'El viaje de Carol'/ 'Carol's journey' tells one of the so many sad stories of the 20th Century. It is a better lesson in history than any book could contain. Again great work from the Peninsula Iberica !	1.0
"This film is actually pertinent even today given the threat of bio-terrorism	 and the threats of superbugs	 West Nile Virus	 and SARS. As a thriller	 the tension is fairly intense. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than serviceable in their roles. The domestic scenes between Widmark and his wife provide a nice interlude to the main plot. The actor in this film who most left his mark is Jack Palance. His sharply defined features and seemingly easygoing exterior always wither way to reveal the avaricious and cruel man beneath the surface. The chase scene through the packing plant is impressive even today. Recommended	 7/10."	1.0
"In this sequel to the 1989 action-comedy classic K-9	 detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee return to fight crime	 but this time they are teamed up with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner	 a mean Doberman named Zues who does not get along with Jerry Lee very well. Dooley does not get along with his new partner much either. That all changes as the movie goes along. The movie is intense as their is a guy that really wants to kill Dooley for the way he treated him in the past. There is some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of Dooley's wife that don't really seem to be with the tone of the movie because the rest of the movie is action sequences	 dog poop jokes	 fart jokes	 and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area. I know that that seems like very low humor	 but some of it is actually very funny. I didn't see this movie for the jokes	 I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is because I am a big James Belushi fan and the second is for the action sequences. James Belushi is funnier than he was in K-9 and the action sequences at are better too. It would have been nice to see more characters from K-9 to return	 but it's still a fun movie. If you are a James Belushi fan	 you'll love this movie."	1.0
"This movie was great! It was an excellent rendition of an ancient myth. The animation was somewhat odd	 but nothing new from Disney. It was definitely better than expected for a Disney movie with no singing.<br /><br />The background animation was magical. It was a different level of work for the Disney people. Some of the characters were a little boxy	 but it was more than made up for with the beauty and lushness of the scenery. The music was largely instrumental but that was perfect for the movie. This was definitely not a film that needed the characters to bust into song.<br /><br />Perfect. 10 out of 10."	1.0
"This is quite a dull movie. Well-shot with realistic performances especially a very good one from Depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and art-house connotations all over	 it fails because the director takes no position	 stand or critical commentary on the topic he stipulates. One of France's revered and regular working partner on films with Depardieu - I believe they made 7 together - Pialat fails to engage. It seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and good-hearted husband around. Isabelle Hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like ""I don't know""; ""I like his arms""; ""I like the way he makes love"" to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliates and reconsiders because... I assume he loves her. So he accepts and hope for what? That she will one day wake up and come to her senses. Things like this are not answered in Pialat's condescending docu-drama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that don't add up. I know the answers do not add up but please take a stand. Jules et Jim	 this is not. The final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving."	1.0
"These reviews that claim this movie is so bad its good are going way overboard with that one. This movie does not have the guilty pleasure badness that Leonard Part 6	 Battlefield Earth and Gigli had. Those movies were entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful. I haven't been in this much pain watching a bad movie since I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I start the review let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a $35 million dollar bust The New Line Cinema refused to put in theaters. They cut the losses sending it straight to video making it the most expensive straight-to-video movie in decades. Whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheck.<br /><br />Plot: a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun which would kill mankind and start another Ice Age. A female cop named Katie Coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named Theodore Rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaur.<br /><br />The plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which robs the movie of all its mystery. Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful. Whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail. Theodore Rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior wears thin after five minutes on screen. Most of the jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tail(on accident and on purpose). I thought Burglar was bad but it takes a backseat to Theodore Rex: the worst movie of Whoopi's career.<br /><br />Don't let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable. I didn't see that when I watched this movie. All I saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick admiration for movie Howard The Duck. The humor is on that level and Theodore Rex looks like the inbred cousin of Barney. Utterly painful from start to finish."	0.0
"This movie tries hard	 but completely lacks the fun of the 1960s TV series	 that I am sure people do remember with fondness. Although I am 17	 I watched some of the series on YouTube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun. Sadly	 this movie does little justice to the series.<br /><br />The special effects are rather substandard	 and this wasn't helped by the flat camera-work. The script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour. Other films with under-par scripting are Home Alone 4	 Cat in the Hat	 Thomas and the Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion.<br /><br />Now I will say I liked the idea of the story	 but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early	 and I am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy. And I was annoyed by the talking suit	 despite spirited voice work from Wayne Knight.<br /><br />But the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of Christopher Lloyd	 Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah	 all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels has pulled off some good performances before	 but he didn't seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing	 and Elizabeth Hurley's character sadly came across as useless. Daryl Hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored	 and I liked the idea of her being the love interest	 but sadly you see very little of her	(not to mention the Monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them) likewise with Wallace Shawn as some kind of government operative. Christopher Lloyd acquits himself better	 and as an actor I like Lloyd a lot(he was in two of my favourite films Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit	 and I am fond of Back To The Future) but he was given little to work with	 and had a tendency to overact quite wildly.<br /><br />Overall	 as much I wanted to like this movie	 I was left unimpressed. Instead of being fun	 it came across as pointless	 and that is a shame because it had a lot of potential	 with some talented actors and a good idea	 but wasted with poor execution. 1/10 Bethany Cox"	0.0
"I realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title. This movie is not primarily about the act of ""riding giants	"" but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport	 RIDING giants	 to change the emphasis.<br /><br />In my teens I lived a block from the Wedge	 one of the hardest-breaking and best bodysurfing spots in the world. I've been out in 15-to-18 foot surf	 and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12-foot waves on many occasions. That experience is why I am in complete awe of the surfers in this film. The idea that Jeff Clark	 to all appearances a normal mortal	 could get away with riding Maverick's BY HIMSELF for over a decade is beyond my grasp. The first safety rule of any water sport is ""Never surf/dive/swim by yourself."" He went where sane people would not	 and lived to tell about it. I wouldn't go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left. <br /><br />In the world of warm water: the first shot of the waves at Jaws always makes the skin tingle over my entire body. These are not just scary waves	 these are uncontrolled-bowel-evacuation waves. When we see Laird Hamilton not only surviving 40-to-60 foot waves (I can hardly type those numbers)	 but actually working the faces like a fun day at Rincon	 I'm blown away. There is a dedication and focus in big-wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world. <br /><br />This a great film. I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because it neglects to mention that there are great big-wave riders in the world outside the Hamilton/Kalama crew	 and I think they deserved mention. Splice in Ken Bradshaw at outside Log Cabins and a 10 it is!"	1.0
"I loved this mini series. Tara Fitzgerald did an incredible job portraying Helen Graham	 a beautiful young woman hiding	 along with her young son	 from a mysterious past. As an anglophile who loves romances... this movie was just my cup of tea and I would recommend it to anyone looking to escape for a few hours into the England of the 1800's. I also must mention that Toby Stephens who portrays the very magnetic Gilbert Markham is reason enough to watch this wonderful production."	1.0

"A propaganda film for the Palestinian ""cause"". If you were expecting an unbiased documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict	 you will need to look elsewhere. If you are an anti-Semite (or merely an anti-Zionist---nothing wrong with advocating the destruction of a country	 right?) or uncritically in support of Palestinian goals (e.g.	 mass murder	 the destruction of Israel)	 this is the documentary for you. Should make for an entertaining evening on college campuses around the UK and US. However	 any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged at the sheer number of lies presented in this video. I just hope those who truly are unaware of the situation aren't corrupted by this anti-Semitic filth."	0.0
I chose to watch this film at Tribeca based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and found it to be one of the best movies in the festival. Both leading actors deliver a well rounded sensitive performance that seems to match the characters on a personal level. The director did a great job bringing the characters and story to life with skill that is usually not seen in a first-time production.<br /><br />One interesting aspect of this film is the love of woodwork and New York City (Brooklyn in specific). The movie revolves around the family furniture making business and weaves delicate cinematography of both carpentry and ordinary Brooklyn life  again kudos to the director on this fine choice.<br /><br />This is gem and I would whole heartedly recommend it (I'm sure it will make it to the screen).	1.0
"Plotwise this is a rather silly little whodunnit masquerading as a period drama/biopic.<br /><br />However the only reason I wanted to see it in the first place was because I was curious about what the great Henry Fonda was really like at his peak.

"This is a well made informative film in the vein of PBS Frontline. The problem is	 Frontline already did this piece and managed to bring L. Paul Bremer in to tell his side of the story. More troubling is the fact that the director of the film	 Charles Ferguson--a former think tank wonk	 was a war supporter until the occupation went south. What did he think would happen? <br /><br />The invasion of Poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky Nazis.And that is what this film feels like--an apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself. <br /><br />Ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been run better--as if any war can be better."	0.0

It's a biker flick but would be a shame to pigeon hole it that way. Funny to the bone	 kinda like Trailer Park Boys in the U.K. If you've never seen TPB	 make a point to if you like this film.

"Where to begin? the special effects should be named special defects	 When the director shouted ""action"" I guess he also indicated to the actors to carry out the worst performance they could think of. Maybe he was annoyed with the producers and wanted to make sure that they would not recover a single cent out of their investment and that the work would be a case study of how not to make movie. Or maybe he hated art school and wanted to be an accountant but his family did not let him.<br /><br />The only thing that is sure that whoever employs him in the future is because its in love with him (so its objectivity jumped through the window) or because he changed its name and deleted all past previous references."	0.0
"David Zucker has directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this goofy farce. Yes	 it's a matter of acquired taste and depends upon a wealth of sophomoric gags	 but it is consistently funny throughout unlike some recent comedic efforts. The film is loaded with all kinds of jokes ranging from the blatantly obvious to the more subtler kind that you must pay attention to everything in the frame or you'll likely miss them. Like his previous efforts which include ""Airplane!""	 ""Top Secret!""	 and ""Naked Gun	"" the humor flies out almost every second. There are so many moments that work	 it's easy to overlook the few that fall flat. What sets this movie apart from other pale imitations in the spoof genre is that it has an actual story line. While others have depended upon making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random movies (take ""Mafia!""	 please)	 this film tells a new story with likable characters. It touches upon sports films in general as well as satirizing the real sports industry instead of lampooning any specific movies. Even for people who don't care for ""South Park	"" its creators	 Matt Stone and Trey Parker	 make a good pair of leading actors with natural chemistry. The film also makes extremely effective use of cameos of athletes	 sports announcers	 and other celebrities	 especially a hilarious bit with Robert Stack of ""Unsolved Mysteries."" By the way	 stay through the credits for a final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All in all	 Zucker has achieved	 in words perhaps applying to the movie's mix of sports	 a home dunk."	1.0
"Some have praised _Atlantis:_The_Lost_Empire_ as a Disney adventure for adults. I don't think so--at least not for thinking adults.<br /><br />This script suggests a beginning as a live-action movie	 that struck someone as the type of crap you cannot sell to adults anymore. The ""crack staff"" of many older adventure movies has been done well before	 (think _The Dirty Dozen_) but _Atlantis_ represents one of the worse films in that motif. The characters are weak. Even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best. An MD/Medicine Man	 a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons	 if we have not at least seen these before	 we have seen mix-and-match quirks before. The story about how one companion	 Vinny played by Don Novello (Fr. Guido Sarducci)	 went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincing.<br /><br />Only the main character	 Milo Thatch	 a young Atlantis-obsessed academic voiced by Michael J. Fox	 has any depth to him. Milo's search for Atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him. The opening scene shows a much younger Milo giddily perched on a knee	 as his grandfather places his pith helmet on his head.<br /><br />And while the characters were thin at best	 the best part about _Atlantis_ was the voice talent. Perhaps Milo's depth is no thicker than Fox's charm. Commander Rourke loses nothing being voiced by James Garner. Although Rourke is a pretty stock military type	 Garner shows his ability to breath life into characters simply by his delivery. Garner's vocal performance is the high point. I'm sorry to say Leonard Nimoy's Dying King is nothing more than obligatory. Additionally	 Don Novello as the demolition expert	 Vinny Santorini	 was also notable for one or two well-done	 funny lines--but I've always liked Father Guido Sarducci	 anyway. <br /><br />Also well done was the Computer Animation. The BACKGROUND animation	 that is. The character animation has not been this bad for Disney since the minimalism that drove Don Bluth out the door. The character animation does nothing if not make already flat characters appear even flatter. Aside from landscapes	 buildings and vehicles there isn't much to impress.<br /><br />The plot was the worst. Some say hackneyed or trite. I'm not so sure about that. Any serviceable plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment. Shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint. So the treatment is the thing. And _Atlantis_ obviously lacks that.<br /><br />I cannot begin to go into all the logic gaps without a spoiler section. The plot was bad. The plot's bridges snap like twine and the ending does not make sense. To add to that	 the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppiness.<br /><br />** SPOILERS **<br /><br />1. Right at the beginning when Milo reveals that runic or Celtic symbols have been wrongly transliterated and the ""Coast of Ireland"" should read the ""Coast of Iceland""	 we begin to have problems. The writers of the script would need to know the British take for Eire or Eireann as ""Ireland""	 and completely ignore the older	 Latin term Hibernia. But more than this	 they need to know of the Vikings conspiracy to call the greener island Iceland and the icier island Greenland. <br /><br />By making it the matter of a mis-tranliterated ""letter""	 the writers have doomed themselves to requiring a runic version of English and a post-Roman date on the script. Since this is long after Atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its undersea cave. And without visible clues and less technology than Milo had	 made the inscription far less trustworthy.<br /><br />2. The Shepard's Journal could not be written before the sinking of Atlantis	 or it would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying ""in the King's eye"". It must have been written after the sinking	 but without even the technology that Milo's expedition had	 how the heck did anybody get by the Leviathan. So how could it know more about anything after that? And why would it be written in Atlantian? <br /><br />Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. However clairvoyance and astral travel do not require the shepard to write in Atlantian. So it's got to be some sort automatic writing. Since noone left in Atlantis can read	 it must be the spirits of the crystal beaming messages to the surface. This would have made more sense. But could also have been explained within the movie: Milo could have discovered that this power had been calling him all his life--appeared in dreams	 etc. This needed to be explored in the movie.<br /><br />3. The Atlantians should simply not be able to comprehend modern languages. No-one expects that the original Indo-Europeans would be able to converse in Europe	 anymore than Romans would understand that hard ""c""s or their day became French ""ch""s (pronounced like ""sh""s	 no less!)<br /><br />4. Current Atlantians were alive before the cataclysm--when apparently they *could* read	 yet now are unable to read what they used to	 or operate similar machinery. <br /><br />5. The Mass Illiteracy points out a crucial flaw in the movie. NOTHING seems to have happened to this culture. It seems suspended in air until Milo can rescue it. Even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival	 no-one wants to compose poetry or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of Atlantian school systems going downhill toward the end and lack of good fiction that caused Atlantis to fall into illiteracy.<br /><br />5. Kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate the machinery if she was so young when the Cataclysm of Stupidity set in--But ANY OF IT **HARDLY** qualifies her father for Deification!! Kashakim's foolishness almost single-handedly wiped his people from existence. Killed a bunch in the cataclysm	 stalled progress (not a lot killed here	 but he oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody	 if they weren't boiled in lava first because the Giant Robots weren't there to protect them. <br /><br />A bolt of blue electricity should have shattered Kashakim's likeness	 when Kida tried joining her father's image to the circle of GREAT Kings of Atlantis! <br /><br />6. Even though Milo was the only one who could read Atlantian	 Rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystal--which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological or ""phases of the sun"" diagram.<br /><br />7. If Milo's grandfather had told Rourke about it	 it still does not explain what how Rourke would have suffered from Milo's reading it as part of the book. Ripping out the page--which was dog-eared in Rourke's hand	 even though Milo found NO sign of a torn page in the book apparently--only was there to tip off the viewer that ""something was not quite right"". Unless the word ""crystal"" would have set alarms off in Milo's head that somebody would try to steal it	 Milo would have suspected nothing. It's just thick-headed foreshadowing.<br /><br />8. The crew's ""double-cross"" was not a character change. We learned that Vinny	 Sweet	 Audrey and Cookie had been going along with Rourke from the beginning. However	 the ""change of heart"" falls flat. It was a change	 and needed to be better motivated. Hard to do with characters who weren't given anything to begin with.<br /><br />9. Niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome	 instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from. It's liquid; it will not flow over the protective dome until it fills up all lower areas.<br /><br />10. The ending STINKS!-- and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness. With it's powersource restored	 Atlantis is no longer a weak power	 needing coddling. The giant robot guardians and the sky-cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might. The technology is superior to ours	 and definitely to early 20th-century. In the end Milo needs to teach the Atlantians to read	 for what? The whole idea is to leave their little quiet	 chastened culture alone	 not to send it into hyperdrive. <br /><br />** END SPOILERS **<br /><br />Perhaps	 the Lost World plot and the turn-of-the-century setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to pulps. The failures I find with the film agree with this idea. But I am at a loss why I should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well. And pulp stories is part of the ""crap they can't sell adults anymore""	 anyway. We have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow up as well. Raiders of the Lost Ark lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness.<br /><br />4 out of 10--the movie is enjoyable but as I think about the plot	 it seeps ever lower."	0.0
"When the employees of a theater find an old reel of film	 they decide to show it at the midnight screening of Night of the Living Dead	 assuming it's an old preview reel. Unfortunately	 it's actually an old Nazi mind control experiment that turns the audience into a horde of mindless shuffling zombies.<br /><br />I can't understand the hate for this movie. It is a low budget independent production with a lot of camp	 but it doesn't deserve a ""1.1"" here on IMDb. It is just so much fun. It is obvious that the filmmakers have a reasonable knowledge and love of old horror movies	 and they have created an entertaining tribute to them sprinkled with references and homages to a variety of them. It has the feel of such things as Night of the Living Dead (in many ways	 very similar)	 Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness	 and various others.<br /><br />I liked the explanation of how the zombies	 though really just hypnotized into thinking they are zombies	 actually come to have the physical attributes of the living dead-unbelievable	 perhaps	 but I appreciate the effort by the writers to explain it. The gore effects were decent for the budget	 the acting was all right	 and the story was entertaining.<br /><br />I liked it."	0.0
"When a movie shocks you with it's disturbing	 brooding atmosphere	 and grabs you by the throat with it's stunning cinematography	 you just know that you have stumbled upon a treat	 masterpiece of a film. Although with most modern movies	 extremely enjoyable as some are	 those that really shock you into focus are the strongest	 and are the ones that are most critically acclaimed and mostly	 stick with you for a life time. I say	 proudly	 that I am a fan of movies that disturb	 not just horror movies	 but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding. Movies like Breakdown and The Missing	 that send a chill down your spine	 making you think ""holy crap	 that could happen to me""	 and visually entice you	 are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie. Because I am only 21	 I did not grow up with actors like Burt Renyolds	 Jon Voight and Ned Beatty	 albeit I am familiar with them	 I didn't watch them grow and proceed as actors	 as opposed to actors now like Shia LaBouf and Justin Long. I must say	 after the long hype and witnessing Deliverance for the first time	 I was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago	 and still lives it's terror up in competition to modern movies. Burt Renyolds plays Lewis	 the macho self appointed leader of a group of four friends on a canoe trip down a fictitious river before a dam is made	 filling the whole wilderness in water. Renyolds' character is an experienced adventurer	 sort of no nonsense	 and filled with machismo. Witnessing him portray the tough guy	 made me think differently about him as an actor	 as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician. The dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough malice to be proved as a strong and even intimidating leader. Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty play as the novice adventurers	 Drew and Bob respectively	 joining in for the fun of a canoe trip. The actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was Jon Voight	 once again I have only seen him as an older actor	 however	 unlike Renyolds	 I have quite liked Voight's acting (and i don't regard Anaconda when I say that)	 for example the national treasure movies. Voight plays Ed	 whom	 like Lewis	 is experienced in adventuring but is seen as a more reserved character	 a reluctant hero/ leader and definitely lacks Lewis' machismo. The film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they canoe the rapids and camp along the riverside. You immediately get a creepy vibe from the hillbilly characters we are introduced to	 like the imbred kid who plays the infamous ""Duelling Banjo's"" at the start of the film with Ronny Cox's character Drew; and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene. As with all atmospheric movies	 from this moment on	 dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form. The canoe trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and nature's odds for survival. The film's cinematics do not let up	 and I back that comment up with the scene in which Ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a composite bow. As Ed falls on to one of his arrows and notices his enemy approaching him	 cocks his rifle	 only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck; was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting I have seen in a film. In wrapping up	 Deliverance is one film	 who's dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date	 remains one of the best films in cinematic history."	1.0
"What happened to Peter Bogdanovich? Once a brilliant director	 a trail blazer... is now scraping the very bottom... Is this the same man who directed ""The Last Picture Show""? Here	 he takes a somewhat interesting (albeit farfetched) premise	 and turns it into bubble gum that loses flavor the moment you take the first bite... Dunst is not bad	 but Izzard is miscast as Chaplin	 and all the other actors seem to have been cast for their ""looks""	 and not because they were right for the part. Too bad. I'll go rent ""Paper Moon"" again."	0.0
"The screenwriter poorly attempted to re-create the ""Exorcist'. But put in some blah-blah love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged. There is no substance whatsoever in this entire film. It had the potential of being something special but blows it by showing a bunch of people yack about things nobody cares about. Extremely boring	 I wanted to leave the theater when I saw this but the dumb movie tickets were expensive so I had to withstand the dreary torture which felt like it lasted forever. Nothing on screen connected relevance back to whatever the characters were talking about.<br /><br />They use computer graphics in here that instead of wowing me (as it intended	 I hate CGI) just ruined the movie even more. Some people say this movie did horrible in the movie theaters because of how ""thought-provoking"" and ""slow-paced-without-action-because it's an intelligent film"" it was. What is so intelligent or thought provoking when the story is basically about pretty boy Heath Ledger as a priest who has a love interest and disobeys his religion? Seems like an uninspired concept. Oh and there's some mumbo jumbo about the ""sin-eater"" (movie was originally going to be titled ""sin-eater""). Lame concept but the movie took the ""sin-eater"" thing too seriously	 making the movie become pathetic and delusional about how dark and intelligent it was. Yeah	 I know there were really sin-eaters in the medieval times but this movie just makes it sound cheesy.<br /><br />Nothing in the movie was executed right and I forget why I even bothered to see this movie. If you want horror films that actually have depth	 watch Rosemary's Baby	 The Tenant	 Naked Blood	 Society	 Cannibal Holocaust	 Pin	 Exorcist	 Omen	 or any of the Romero ""Dead Trilogy"" films. Nonsense dialogue does not equate to intelligence people	 mainstream movie fans think that though (same kind of people that think a ridiculous movie like Hulk is a cinematic masterpiece). If you want mind-numbingly boring horror	 watch the Order. This movie makes church seem like a roller coaster ride."	0.0
"I was bored one night and Red Eye was on and thought why not.<br /><br />Red Eye is one of the best movies in a long time.<br /><br />I mean I just got into the movie cause it was just so brilliant.<br /><br />The story is new and different.<br /><br />The movie also has two great leads in the movie with Rachel Mcadams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian Murphy as Jackson Rippner.<br /><br />The acting is just brilliant and you get the feel for the people in the movie.<br /><br />The music is just excellent	 it give you chills and can also make you feel relax.<br /><br />I just love how the movie was just so well done and it never gets boring.<br /><br />Red Eye is just phenomenal. Nothing more and nothing less.<br /><br />It's a excellent thriller.<br /><br />Overall	 I enjoy Red Eye so much that I can watch it over and over again.<br /><br />If you like Red Eye	 then I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf.<br /><br />I give Red Eye 9 out of 10.<br /><br />Great movie"	1.0
"I'm Italian and when I've recently looked again this film I astonished for its beauty: the first time I was 10 years old and I liked it	 but today I can appreciate it with adult mind and feelings. Now I can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the Italian cinema (Pasolini etc.)	 by that time gone. <br /><br />The Hollywood epic films are good...for fun. Perhaps this 'Odyssey' had no English version because is not enough funny... not suitable for pop-corn and coke audience. However suitable for Homer pathos and existentialist reflections.<br /><br />In Italy was recently released a very good DVD version: INTEGRAL	 with excellent colors. You can find it in some file sharing	 but it's Italian only	 and without subtitles. Too bad: also the dialogs and the voices of this film are remarkable."	1.0
Guy walking around without motive... I will never get those two hours of my life back. The guy kept on assuming identities and cheating on his pregnant wife. What was I thinking? How did this win a price anywhere? I understood he loved his father but other than that the movie was completely senseless to me. What was the purpose of walking so much and going to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason. How did this enrich his life??? Why did we have to see the dying old lady on her underwear????!!! Why???!!!!<br /><br />I though it would be deep or about something more interesting. I do not recommend the movie even to leave on while sleeping...	0.0
"They probably should have called this movie The Map because the majority of the whole stupid film is revolved around a map of a cemetery. Not to mention how many of the same boring shots of the map there are. The only thing they show more than the map itself is the little beads of sweat that is constantly building up on the forehead of our main character. This of course was the film makers way of showing us how incredibly tense things are getting up on the Immortal Hills Cemetery. Come on now 	 couldn't they have shown us just one of the death scenes? We hear a whole lot about how everyone who is listed on the map is dropping like flies but we don't get to see anything. Some how I Bury The Living manged to keep my attention so i was fairly generous with the rating i gave it but i will not recommend this movie to anyone. Unless you have a deep fascination with maps or sweat i recommend renting a better I movie 	 such as I Spit On Your Grave or I Drink Your Blood."	0.0
"Jackie Chan's classic directorial feature POLICE STORY (1985) is among the most influential and over-the-top modern day police actioners ever to come out from Hong Kong. Jackie wanted simply to make a movie which would include the usual kung fu and also fierce gun play and other ""urban"" action which would later become very popular and typical among HK directors like John Woo and Ringo Lam. POLICE STORY mixes these two action elements and styles and the result is as wild as it sounds.<br /><br />Jackie plays Chan Ka-Kui	 a police who gets to protect an important witness (Brigitte Lin) who would soon testify against a powerful gangster boss and his ring of criminal activity. Jackie's girlfriend is played by young and sweet Maggie Cheung	 who isn't as wild here as she would be in her subsequent roles like Heroic Trio (and the sequel) by Johnnie To	 Savior of the Soul by Corey Yuen and David Lai and many many others. The plot in POLICE STORY is very simple but it is the action why this film was made in the first place.<br /><br />Jackie did of course all the stunts of his character by himself and also hurt himself pretty badly in couple of scenes	 some of which are also in the completed movie like at the end in which Jackie hits his head (near the eye) through a very nasty looking sharp piece of glass. Also Jackie's stunt team members almost got themselves killed during filming of this film. The scene in which a bus stops right before Jackie	 spitting the kidnappers through the windshield	 went really bad as the bus stopped too early and the stuntmen didn't fly as they were supposed to. They were supposed to fly on the car parked in the front of the bus but their flight was too short and they hit through the asphalt with hospital level injuries. During the end credits	 there is a behind the scenes imagery and images of these injured actors and it all looks really bad and almost tasteless	 but fortunately no one got killed or injured too severely.<br /><br />The action is more than plentiful and imaginative as can be expected by (action) director Chan. The now legendary bus scene and shopping mall scene at then end are most likely among the wildest scenes any action film has been able to deliver. Jackie always tells how important editing is (which is true) and it really shows in his action scenes and their timing which is perfect and makes the films look so ultra kinetic when compared to Hollywood efforts	 for instance. There's hardly any slow moments here and also those moments are interesting and the film never becomes boring or hard to watch.<br /><br />But there is again one negative point which I cannot stand in HK action comedies	 which is this comedy itself. The comedy isn't funny especially when the errors and amateurish elements in the screenplay aren't there by accident but because of the writer wanted to add them there	 without necessarily understanding that they are signs of bad script and stupid dialogue. I mean those scenes like the stabbing murder attempt at the beginning when the murderer just shouts and screams and makes faces and acts like a drunken clown from some slapstick nightmare	 and he is there to ""murder"" that girl. This kind of acting is stupid and inept and I wouldn't like to see it in a film which is otherwise very great in its own genre. Characters also speak their thoughts which is also a sign of bad script because those ""loud thoughts"" are there just to make things clear even for the stupidest viewer and thus making things way too simple and ""light."" Even if the film is comic and not so serious	 these kind of stupidities should not be there and they cannot be forgiven too easily.<br /><br />POLICE STORY is a fast speed	 full impact	 balls to the walls action adventure miracle from Hong Kong and from the time when Jackie was very sad because of the bad result he got with the US produced The Protector as he didn't have the same thoughts about the film as director James Glickenhaus had and thus the result didn't please audiences and Jackie and he returned to Hong Kong to make more personal and inventive film. That he definitely did and the result is as wild today as it was back then in the 80's. This is among the most insane action films ever	 and it would be somewhat perfect without the flaws I mentioned. 7/10"	1.0
"Frailty is a non-gory horror film that achieves its chills by following the logic and impact of a man's delusion/obsession straight into depravity. Dad (we never learn his name) is a gentle man and loving father who's raising his sons alone after Mom died giving birth to the youngest son	 Adam. The family's world flips upside down late one night when Dad rushes into the boys' room and tells them God has given him a vision. And what a vision  the entire family's job is to destroy demons	 who	 of course	 are disguised in human form.<br /><br />Proceeding from this premise	 the movie is unflinching in following it. Dad kidnaps people/demons whom God has told him to destroy	 binds them	 lays his hand on them to see a vision of their evil	 then kills them  while making his young sons watch. Fenton	 the older boy	 is horrified	 seeing only a father who's turned into a crazed murderer. Adam	 the younger	 is uncomfortable	 but trusts that Dad is following God's will. Eventually	 Dad takes his sons on missions to abduct the ""demons"" that God has put on Dad's list	 and finally	 invites them to fully participate in God's mission for the family.<br /><br />This is not	 you understand	 an abusive father. He loves his children. He is only following God's instructions: ""This is our job now	 son. We've got to do this."" When Fenton	 terrified and convinced his father has gone mad	 says he'll report him to the police	 his father explains	 ""If you do that	 son	 I'll die. The angel was clear on this."" The pressure that the children are under is unbearable and tragic	 and warps their entire lives.(1) The movie's structure is similar to the one used in The Usual Suspects: a story in flashback	 told in a police station to a FBI agent. The moody lighting	 the stormy weather	 and the eerie calm in the present day add to the menace of the backstory. I wanted to believe the unfolding horror was just a story	 until I remembered the real-life parallel of Andrea Yates	 who believed she was possessed by Satan and could save her children by drowning them. Even then	 I wanted to believe that I was watching a human tragedy	 rather than a story of divine retribution.<br /><br />The movie gave me no such comfort	 though	 as it gave strong clues at the end about the veracity of Dad's vision. And this	 as much as some plot holes	 posed a problem for me. Regardless of the accuracy of Dad's visions	 regardless of the evil that his victims may have committed	 where does anyone derive the authority to act as an angel of death?

"Aardman does it again. Next to Pixar	 Aardman Animation proves again and again how to do animation properly.<br /><br />I had a great time watching the first episode of Creature Comforts. I thought it translated well for American audiences. My only concern is that most of the audiences aren't going to get the subtle humor in this show.<br /><br />Having been a fan of the BBC version and the short film	 I knew what I was in for when I sat down to watch this. The animators did a great job matching up pre-recorded voices to a perfect match animal. Look at the first episode with the Goat	 who sounds stoned	 and the dogs on the street that keep calling each other ""dawg"".<br /><br />Is this for everyone? Not by a long shot. In fact	 I'd be happy to see the show last for a full season. But like I said before	 audiences aren't going to get it."	1.0
"...you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie	 DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE. If you want a documentary-esquire look at ""hood life"" you're at the wrong place as well. If you're looking for a laughable piece of film	 this is a real winner! The acting is as flat as a piece of paper. The best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive-by. I can tell that he did the voice for the 911 operator as well by the flat tone of his voice. If I could hear a cardboard box talk	 it'd probably sound like this guy. Oh yea	 and the ""zombies"" did their best snake impression which is on par with their FANTASTIC acting overall (note sarcasm...HOW DID THIS NOT WIN AN Oscar FOR BEST MAKE-UP) The Quiroz......did not do any sort of directing. I felt like I was watching an improvisational period piece (the period is more like 1990's LA) The direction is however one-uped by the worst script I think to ever grace a movie. I haven't heard such lovely lines	 like the epic one word beginning to the movie ""F**k!""	 since Ice Grill which was another ""urban"" thriller. This only works of course in conjunction with the also-epic hip-hop soundtrack! All 3 or so songs of it! All in all	 what the hell did you expect from a movie entitled ""Hood of the Living Dead""? I rented this movie with full intention to laugh at its every scene	 and boy it delivered and MORE! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of guys and laugh at a low budget horror (yea right...) movie for the night. A memorable experience for sure!"	0.0

i must say this movie is truly amazing and heartwarming. Reese Witherspoon is so charming and Jason London's not so bad either! it is so sweet watching Dani fall in love and it breaks my heart and yet warms my heart at the same time watching Court fall in love with Maureen. however it is even sweeter watching how much he cares for Dani. I must admit though i did kind of want him to fall for Dani in the end. it is just so cute watching her fall for him i did not want her to get her heart broken so badly. but the biggest tragedy i have ever seen occurred in this movie. watching him die made me cry for a whole day. i just could not believe it. however never a more loving relationship has been shown in a movie then Maureen and Dani. they really can make it through anything. i am giving this movie a 9 because i didn't want Court to die but it was still one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen.	1.0
Did anyone stop to realise what sort of movie they were producing here ? Now let`s a former marine officer becomes assinged to a group of kids at a cadet school so this should be a family comedy right ? Wrong . This is just a gross comedy aimed at teenagers with many bad taste moments .It might have been watchable in an extremely dumb way at this point but I found Damon Wayans voice to be irritating beyond belief . Does he speak like that in real life ? If he does then he has my sympathy but he won`t be getting any of my money from watching his movies	0.0
"Garam Masala is one of the funniest film I've seen in ages. Akshay Kumar is excellent as the womaniser who has affairs with 3 girls and engaged at the same time. John Abraham is Amusing at times and this is one of his best works so far. Paresh Rawail is superb as usual in most of his films. The director Priyadarshan has delivered great Movies in the past. Hera Pheri	 Hungama and Hulchul being some of the Best. Garam Masala is his funniest film he has made. The three newcomer actresses are average. Rimi sen doesn't get much scope in this movie. I was impressed to see how Priyadarshan made a movie with a simple storyline of a guy having a affair with 3 girls at the same time. All 3 girls have a day off in the same day and end up in the same house. Packed with loads of Laughs	 this is one Non stop Entertainer."	1.0
"Let's go straight to the point: this is The Movie I would take with me on a desert island (with dvd player). It's just perfect. If a reason for you to see a movie is that you love the actors	 you like to see them free to involve in the space and feelings	 this movie is for you. See the scene when Myrtle (Rowlands) come on stage drunk and Maurice(Cassavetes) has to improvise because she doesn't follow the script anymore. If you're sensitive to the camera's movements	 you'll be fascinated by the way the camera moves on stage	 the particular flow	 that give you the impression camera follow the actors as if it was lead by the theatrical principle of ""private space""... amazing. And the story is just a brilliant mix of tale and realistic drama. Cassavetes is again arguing with Hollywood and the majors' politics	 but this time	 he do it through Broadway	 making one of the most exciting movie about theater. Well	 this movie is a bliss."	1.0
"Janeane Garofalo has been very public in her displeasure about this film	 calling it	 among other things	 anti-feminist. She has also said on her radio show she hates making ""romantic comedies"" because she doesn't believe in them. I wholeheartedly agree with Janeane here. This film is a trifle at best. She does her best	 but overall	 it was just another boring	 unbelievable ""romantic comedy"" that has no basis in the real world. Whereas there will be some who will say ""suspend your disbelief""	 one grows tired of having to suspend it nearly every time you get a romantic film from Hollywood. Janeane's character	 for some reason	 is usually filmed in shadows and darkness	 which makes her look unattractive	 while Uma's character is filmed in lighter tones (which probably displeased Janeane and is probably one of the reasons she detests this film). That really hurts the film if we are to buy the premise that Janeane is supposed to be the better looking of the two. As many have said here and on other comment threads	 Janeane is not ugly	 but in fact	 quite beautiful. I haven't read one review where someone said Uma was better looking. Having said that though	 I believe that Ben Chaplin's character would more than likely stay with Uma	 not Janeane. Many men don't like really intelligent women (and many women don't like really intelligent men)	 and sadly	 Ben probably would have stayed with Uma. And despite the director's attempt to make Janeane unattractive	 it doesn't work. Her natural beauty comes through anyway.<br /><br />I think a lot of Janeane's male fans who are obsessed with her like this film because they like to think of themselves in the Ben Chaplin character	 and actually scoring with Janeane. Janeane is a lot more complicated than the character she plays here (real life is always much more complex than Hollywood can imagine)	 so take a cold shower gentlemen. This is the role that Janeane is best known for	 and that's a shame	 as this really isn't that good of a film."	0.0

"Nothing revolutionary here; just impeccably elegant	 restrained cinema.<br /><br />GARDE A VUE is confined almost exclusively to a drab police station	 and mostly to one interrogation room	 but director Claude Miller (who made the wonderful film THIS SWEET SICKNESS	 among others) intercalates spare glimpses of exterior tableaux as minimalist locale scenography. Miller's restraint	 especially early on	 is breathtaking	 and his exquisite handling of the consequently-pivotal interior mise-en-scene makes for captivating viewing.<br /><br />Lino Ventura is superb as usual	 succeeding to legitimize a character that	 on paper	 is cliche: the laconic	 hard-nosed	 world-weary homicide detective. Ventura lives the role	 making it completely believable	 even though the script allows us little access to his inner workings; the film ends at the very moment it appears he will be forced to confront his failure for the first time.<br /><br />Michel Serrault is equal to the task as the suspected child-killer who shrewdly spars with the single-minded flic. The exchanges between the two are more-often-than-not pregnant with tension and the aura of a constantly metamorphosing playing field for a battle of wits. Serrault's character is by turns deplorably haughty and cunning	 and pitiable; then later....<br /><br />The ""message"" of GARDE A VUE	 if one were to search for one	 is a condemnation of police methodology and the kind of pressures that make a cop over-zealous to	 if necessary	 close cases at the expense of justice. For most of its length though the film shines as nothing more than an exemplar of how to turn a potentially soporific set-bound scenario into a suspenseful drama of the utmost cinematic economy.<br /><br />"	1.0

"This long winded film turns out to be less about Berkowitz and his effect on NYC	 but more about painting caricatures of a certain group of Italian-Americans	 known locally as ""Guidos."" The problem is that ""Guidos"" are uninteresting	 no matter what kind of story or setting they are immersed in. They are already living caricatures	 so Lee only amplifies them	 rather than simply portraying them.<br /><br />When someone has a caricature done of themselves	 they don't go home and say	 ""Hey	 let's make the ears and nose even bigger!"" That's what Lee has done in this film. The most interesting characters in the film are the two (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito) who wish to escape the ""Guido"" lifestyle. Top it off with an uninteresting storyline for the characters	 particularly John Leguizamo's	 and you get a nice film to fall asleep by. Especially considering it's lengthy run time.<br /><br />One more strike against it: For someone proclaiming to be a Yankees fan	 and has grown up in New York	 Spike Lee should know how to spell Phil Rizzuto	 which is spelled incorrectly in the closing credits."	0.0
"No rubbish - no where even near rubbish. Not an original? thats the last thing that could be said of ""2.4 children"".Predictable? certainly not! Although it was somewhat an unusual series for the BBC	 it was hilarious	 funny	 and witty. I particularly liked Belinda Lang and John Pickard - who I believe preformed wonderfully.Gary olsen was also very good and so were all the other cast members..I never quite new why it was can-celled till reading here today about Gary Olsen's death at a relatively young age. I do wish that they would make more of comedy of this type	 much more of them (and show them here in Israel).Thumbs way up!"	1.0
"That's My Bush is a live action project made by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone.The show was cancelled after one season	 not because of bad reviews(it actually got good reviews)	 but because it was very expensive.That's my bush is a pretty funny spoof of an average network TV sitcom.It is also a political satire.Now	 this is nowhere near as good as South Park	 but it is a very funny spoof of a sitcom and also a pretty good political satire.The guy who plays in that's my bush looks a lot like him!

"This film is justly famous as one of the most horrible examples of propaganda ever produced. The insistent equation of Jews with disease is simply<br /><br />pathological	 and even worse it almost becomes believable for brief seconds<br /><br />through its sheer repetition. The fact that something this crude works	 even<br /><br />briefly	 is an object lesson in itself. You have to have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself to sit through this	 and I wouldn't recommend trying unless you have a good reason."	0.0
"Not even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could save this dead fish of a film. For starters	 the script was definitely written to be made into a B-film	 but somehow Duchovny (looking for a star vehicle to elevate himself out of television) and Hutton (looking for the ""two"" of a ""one-two punch"" he had hoped would define his career after ""Ordinary People"") became attached to the picture. Cheesy lines	 big bad wipes from scene to scene (Come on--who uses wipes after 12th Grade Telecommunications class?)	 and plain old bad acting sink this film. Even Duchovny is not immune to the bad acting plague that is this film. Only Timothy Hutton rises above the material at all. I must admit feeling Duchovny's pain as he read the lines that are the voice-over. While I found myself laughing when I'm sure the director wanted me to feel terrified	 nothing prepared me for the closing line of Duchonvey's voice-over: ""if you ever need a doctor	 be sure to call 911."" If only the studio had called 911	 this dog of a motion picture would never have been made. Avoid at all costs. <br /><br />"	0.0
"Watching this several times as a child was quite the experience 15 years ago	 and now that I've found it again it still has a film experience like few others. If risky	 it's a great display of morals and life lessons recommended for family viewing with young kids. While it still holds up as an adult	 I was fortunate to have learned from it many times over years ago. Trying to find it today is hard enough . . . but believe me it is well worth it no matter what the age. Anime fans especially will find this a great entry to Masami Hata's filmography. With impressive art work and unique designs	 ""Chirin No Suzu"" represents a worthwhile experience. While some of the lyrical songs are not so hot when recorded in English	 the musical score is nevertheless captivating. But even the voice acting is far better than much released today. Unfortunately is went out of print in the mid-1980s from RCA Columbia Home Video	 and has not received any new format release to my knowledge	 at least in the US. Look hard for it and you will be quite satisfied! It's an artful	 intense	 enjoyable	 and important landmark in Japanese animation."	1.0
"This is one of my all-time favorite films	 and while it may move too slowly for some	 it's well worth seeing. A corporate lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) is dragged into a case involving ""city"" Aborigines	 and this is no ordinary case. OK	 a man has died but it wasn't exactly a normal killing. There has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately	 and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic & oppressive. The Aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans. This has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about ""City"" vs. ""Tribal"" Aborigines	 and of course no Abo in the big city would practice tribal ways. Uh huh. Chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what's happening	 although no matter how many times I've seen this I can't quite grasp the exact connection. This is a very eerie and creepy film	 and is a fine example of Peter Weir's ability to create tension out of nothing. The ending is a little ambiguous but I take it literally	 it's the easiest way out and the scariest. 10 out of 10 and highly recommended."	1.0
"I have seen this movie many times	 (and recently read the book the movie is based on) and every time I see it	 I just want to slap all four of them. The fact that they don't clue in to the fact that Tom Hank's character is flipping into his D&D(oops M&M) :) persona (""Oh	 he's just acting in character."") outside of the gaming session. That and the fact that after three months of therapy	 let's just destroy all that and feed his delusions! These kind of people are what give RPGs a bad name.<br /><br />Also the corny 'love ballad'	 and the music done by 'cat on a piano' and 'stop us if we get too annoying' are almost enough to set your teeth on edge!"	0.0
"Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron is amassing quite the list of films which provide a glimpse into their specific era. Her previous ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"" were at their best when commenting on the quirkiness of society during that period. Although ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is obviously about Ms. Page	 it is every bit as much a peak behind the curtain at the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50's.<br /><br />The film is fun to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together. The grainy B&W film and photos capture the time and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is very well done.<br /><br />The supporting cast is strong with David Strathairn (fresh off his Edward R. Murrow role)	 Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is the wonderfully talented and underrated and underworked Gretchen Mol. Ms. Mol always brings an edge and spirit to her roles. She was absolutely mesmerizing in the little seen	 Jason Alexander directed ""Just Looking"" in 2000. Here she is the notorious Bettie Page. Her smile is captivating and her body is flawless. She really seems to enjoy this role and helps us understand how the girl next door from Tennessee could become the underworld Pin-up queen.<br /><br />As one would expect	 the soundtrack from the era is terrific. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured performers. Although the film hints at providing a history into this industry	 the final third kinda falls flat preventing pure movie magic. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page make this a fun movie to watch and one that will yield endless showings on HBO in the near future. Now will someone please turn Ms. Mol into the star she should be?"	1.0
"This is a really interesting movie. It is an action movie with comedy mixed in. Foxx teams up with comedian Epps in this movie to give it a comedic spin. It will keep you wondering whats going to happen to Foxx next. It was a well shot movie	 the director used the right colors in this movie(dark blue colors) to give it the right kind of feel. Kimberly Elise also starred in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen. She plays her role well. Even Jamie Kennedy is in this movie. It's worth seeing it you haven't seen it. It's definitely worth having if you are a Jamie Foxx fan. It deserves more credit than it is actually given."	1.0
"I bought a set of 4 DVDs for 10 bucks at my local Suncoast	 which contained this movie and three other trashy horror flicks (including its sequel ""Witchcraft XI""). So basically I paid the rock bottom price of $2.50 for this movie	 if you do the math. I can't exactly say I was ripped off. I have a thing for trashy horror movies	 but this is the kind of trash that gives trash a bad name. The budget couldn't be over $1	000 (though it appears as if they spent a total of $1.50). I know it's a low-budget film	 but that's no excuse for totally uninspired camerawork. The film ""Blood Cult	"" though not very good	 was made for an extremely low budget and still had fairly good camerawork and acting. The acting in this movie is the definition of ""effortless	"" especially from that muscular guy with the Texas accent. Everyone is pretty much reading their lines off the page. You can take that figuratively or literally. I wouldn't be surprised if the script was off-camera as they were performing. I said before that I've never seen a bad English actor. This movie has quite a few bad ones. And though English movies aren't always good	 they always seem to have at least a level of sophistication	 which is why I don't see why any Englishman	 or Englishwoman	 would volunteer to do a home-video-style schlock flick like this. Did Merchant Ivory put a hold on their casting calls? Usually	 I think people are too hard on directors and actors. Even some of the worst movies in Hollywood have some level of professionalism in the directing	 acting and cinematography departments. Even when you watch a movie like ""Glitter"" you can't honestly say it looks like a third-grader shot those scenes (though a third-grader could've written the script). I've seen home movies that are shot better than ""Witchcraft X	"" and that's no exaggeration whatsoever. Even the gore is minimal since the filmmakers only had money to buy some fake blood on sale at Party City. Not a single effort was put into making this movie--let's just sum it up like that. You get the picture. There's a good deal of nudity	 though that doesn't save it. However	 I must say that girl with the red-orange hair	 who's either naked or wearing a cleavage-popping outfit throughout the film	 is really hot! <br /><br />My score: 1 (out of 10)"	0.0
"Henri Verneuil represented the commercial cinema in France from 1960-1980. Always strong at the box-office	 and usually telling dramatic and suspenseful tales of casino robberies	 mafia score-settling and World War II battles	 Verneuil could be counted on to give us two solid hours of entertainment on Saturday night. He worked with the cream of the male actors of his day: Gabin	 Belmondo	 Fernandel	 Delon	 Sharif	 Anthony Quinn. I... comme Icare is the only time he directed Yves Montand. It's an oddly static film	 taking place mainly in offices and conference rooms	 containing not one chase scene and hardly any violence.<br /><br />Montand gives a good performance	 if somewhat dry	 and he is well supported by the other actors. I couldn't help wondering what Costa-Gavras could have done with this story	 on the basis of Z (the Lambrakis assassination) and L'aveu (the torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by Stalinists)."	1.0
"I swear I could watch this movie every weekend of my life and never get sick of it! Every aspect of human emotion is captured so magically by the acting	 the script	 the direction	 and the general feeling of this movie.

We need MORE MOVIES like this!!! Mike Binder: are you listening???"	1.0
"Sadly IMDb does not allow me to rate Judges lower than 1. What a shame. This ghastly movie is so bad that I actually turned the damned thing off well before the ending. The script had a few bright moments	 but the directing	 editing	 acting	 audio quality	 and especially timing on line delivery was so abhorrent as make Judges utterly unbearable.<br /><br />Judges was advertised as being like a modern day comic book style western	 but in reality was nothing of the sort. What it is most like is dog poop on the bottom of your shoe. You can try to pretend it is okay	 but it just keeps on stinking.<br /><br />Why video stores think it is okay to carry this kind of crap with constant gaps in the audio and worse than high school drama class acting is beyond me. We rent movies in order to see something better that what is on television. But Judges is worse than the most pathetic SciFi Channel original. I intend to demand my money back from Hollywood Video."	0.0
"In the history of movies based on comic books	 ""Mystery Men"" is one of the most underrated ones. This is no regular comic superhero movie! It follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning wannabes	 which include Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller)	 the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo)	 the Shoveller (William H. Macy)	 the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Spleen (Paul Reubens). ""Mystery Men"" spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like ""Superman"" or ""Batman	"" such as the pithy sayings	 and the questions about secret identities. Most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like Bruce Wayne	 but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives. So it looks as if director Kinka Usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to. I found ""Mystery Men"" to be visually stimulating and very funny. Even if it doesn't turn into a franchise	 it's still a joy to watch!"	1.0
"The movie deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl	 (I'm sorry I'm biased	 i think pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies)	 and 0.5 for the fact that it is shorter than Azumi 1. I watched Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating. I amazed myself being able to sit through it. <br /><br />Lets talk about the plus points of the movie. The girl. Ueto Aya is cute. Thats all there is to salvage the whole movie. The fact is	 if the main character was male	 i am sure that most people (including me) would not have touched the movie at all. <br /><br />Now lets talk about the minus points. Firstly	 it is real draggy	 with lots and lots of repeated scenes. Scenes of Nachi and Azumi keeps coming back. It seems more like a drama way of shooting. Typical Japanese dramas love flashbacks	 and this movie too. Secondly	 the movie is too unrealistic in a historical setting. I do not mind unrealistic movies. But this movie is like a poor way of showing creativeness	 by throwing in ninjas that act like bears and spider webs	 etc... it reminds me of Shinobi	 though Shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting. Moreover	 to portray ""i-don't-know"" what effect	 the director films people dying with blood spraying (literally) all around... people not realizing their head was cut off... etc.. etc... etc... Too many of these spoils the show. It seems like the anime influence is strong in this movie. It degrades the show greatly. Thirdly	 Isn't Azumi supposed to be an assassin. She seems more like an one-man-army to me	 just that she is a female. I don't think you see assassins charging into army camps. The only time i felt she acted ""assassin-liked"" was when she killed the Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Lastly	 the plot was thin in both movies. Its a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way."	0.0
"Hi	 I'm a friend of werewolf movies	 and when i saw the title of Darkwolf hitting the shelves i was like ""hmm	 simple and nice name to it at least. Althou... i wonder why i haven't heard of it before.""<br /><br />First of all	 the movie starts with tits. Lots of tits. Tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to. Who cares about a werewolf effect	 just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots!<br /><br />So	 about the mysterious darkwolf character (a little spoilers ahead	 but who really cares...) He's your average everyday biker. Not even super-tough looking	 but like the old wise woman says in the movie ""he is far more powerful and dangerous than you've ever faced before."" Just by describing her a tattooed biker-type of a guy. Pretty original. I even had look twice when they first used the ""red glowing eyes"" SPECIAL EFFECT! I mean my god	 that ""lets-plant-red-dots-on-eyes-with-computer"" effect has been used since the seventies. It looks plain ugly here! And don't get me started with the werewolf 3D-CGI. As said before	 like an bad and old video game.<br /><br />And finally	 as i do like werewolf films	 like i said. They prettymuch always build a werewolf-legend of their own. Darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well	 about some silly legends of hybrid-werewolves and the ancient bloodline. BUT. It almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement ""the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched"" starts random-slashing. Which just doesn't make any sense	 why even bother telling us the rules of killing	 when they aren't even gonna play by them... Aplus the wolf-point-of-view shots are made with a sony handycam or something	 filming mostly the floor and walls. Just add growling noises and you've got a super werewolf effect. The gore is partially OK. But when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand	 just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims	 it just doesn't do the trick for me...<br /><br />Truly	 WHO gives money to make these heaps of junk straight-to-video horrortitles	 they aren't even funny-kind of bad movies	 just sad."	0.0
"Let me start off by saying that this doesn't seem or feel like a movie. It seems like just another TV show about popular girls and boys with no real film language top back it up.<br /><br />The camera angles are so straight forward that the story is told the simplest way possible never making the public connect with it. This film takes us to where no movie I've seen has done before: to a realm where the Film Theater becomes a warm medium giving the public every element of interpretation. Too obvious. The large movie screen is only used as an enlarged TV from where we can see every attribute of these women in a larger than life manner.<br /><br />Lately it seems that young directors are compromising the Art of film making for sales. This is very scary. The industry is spoiling the art in movies. We must educate ourselves and our children about what cinematography and its language are really about. Not just sales and entertainment	 but a way to communicate feelings	 passions and even culture. Not as a launching platform for young divas and jocks."	0.0
"What of Domino did I hate over everything	 and I mean everything	 else? Perhaps it was the overall glorification of being a bounty hunter; maybe it was the sexism masquerading as an involving and interesting study of a hard bodied female lead character; maybe it was the mere look of the film with its bizarre yellow glow and distorted blue tints or the manner in which it takes an actress like Lucy Lui; who deserves a lot better than this junk; and has her sit there in the one spot in the room the light cannot directly hit with the same dumb look on her face. Maybe it's the editing; that horrid rapid fire editing and the manner in which lines of dialogue echo as they're uttered by people like Kiera Knightly who	 if you buy as a bounty hunter	 then you'll probably be able to kid yourself into believing the world will end in 2012.<br /><br />Nobody comes away from Domino with any sort credibility	 absolutely nobody at all. It is a painful and misguided experience	 taking inspiration from things like Natural Born Killers and letting loose ideas to an audience not even there for them. The principal question is: 'Was Domino supposed to be some kind of comedy?' what with its hilariously bad lead uttering certain lines that desperately want us to think she's coming across as 'tough' but really	 she resembles more an arrogant fifteen year old girl on her first day at public school	 attempting to impress her peers. There are things you genuinely don't know how to react to	 whether they're supposed to be funny or not. If it is supposed to be a comedy	 that begs the next question: 'Is the life of a bounty hunter really the sort worth exploiting for laughs?' I don't think so.<br /><br />The film opens with the title card 'Based on a true story........sort of.' If that's supposed to be some sort of post-modernist technique that enables director Tony Scott to bend and manipulate the story of Domino Harvey for his own unique purpose	 then you're simply on another planet. Truth is	 in that one opening quote the film identifies the subject matter and the original text before completely copping out and saying 'sort of' which I guess is supposed to enable them to make Domino older than she should be and appear on Jerry Springer. Following this	 we learn of Domino's relationship with her father who died in the film when when she was ten or something; here is the first use of the 'sort of' cop out as in real life she was just four. But if the film had gone by reality's dates then her entire drive would've been born out of the death of........her goldfish.<br /><br />We are then thrust into action with Ed Mosbey (Rourke); Domino (Knightley) herself and would-be love interest Choco (Ramírez). During the scene	 an American mother is pinned down via gunfire in her own caravan in the back end of nowhere as she pleads for her son's life to be spared. What a really misguided opening; presenting its three leads as nasty people who break into trailers	 fire off weapons at innocents we don't know anything of and come close to shooting their pet dogs.<br /><br />The immediate feeling is of hatred toward the three leads	 a feeling of 'No	 why are you doing this? Why is this happening?' Bad seeds are planted and	 wouldn't you know it	 they stick. The film is painful to watch	 excruciating even; as these three mug their way through the piece complete with supporting performances from actors known for playing characters in Beverly Hills 90210. Here is another daft post-modernist slant	 people playing themselves and that 'sort of' Joker card being played again. Christopher Walken even pops up in a really stupid role that reeks of Robert Downey Jr's Natural Born Killers character.<br /><br />So as the film plods on and Domino is cast into Ed and Choco's gang	 purely for her good looks I might add	 it appears amidst the plot to do with fake driver's registration I.Ds or something that Choco and Domino may have feelings for one another. The problem is	 as each performer is doing such a bad job in their respective character; there is no chemistry and no feeling between the two; the film isn't a love story so why even bother going down that road in the first place? Does anyone care about these two characters amidst all the fast edits and stuff blowing up? If there is any 'feeling' between Choco and Domino	 it exists on such a small	 tiny	 minimalist scale that you have to ask why it's even included.<br /><br />So then the film feels the need to crank things up narrative-wise. We find out the reason for the fake I.Ds that are linked to someone else and a guy talks on a cell phone in a sound proof bubble. The sound proof bubble I can believe but how does he get his phone under the water and into the bubble in the first place without it becoming flooded? He must've swam really quickly  double the speed of the film's fasted edit which means something in the region of .01 of a second. Yeah	 sure. The film's story becomes both too complicated and just plain arbitrary before resorting to a really dumb climax in which more stuff blows up. Plus	 there's a really distasteful scene to do with a wall chart full of new ethnicities and the film's comedy runs SO dry	 that it has to resort to the ""Jerry	 Jerry!"" chant whilst people are on a popular American talk show. When did we last laugh at ""Jerry! Jerry!""? when we were	 say	 seven years old? I came away feeling sad and depressed at such a film's existence."	0.0
"This ranks as one of the worst movies I've seen in years. Besides Cuba and Angie	 the acting is actually embarrassing. Wasn't Archer once a decent actress? What happened to her? The action is decent but completely implausible. The make up is so bad it's worth mentioning. I mean	 who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film. Someone should tell the make up artist	 and the DOP that you're not supposed to actually see it. The ending is a massive disappointment - along the lines of ""and then they realized it was all a dream""<br /><br />Don't waste your time or your money. You're better off just staring into space for 2 hours."	0.0
"I think this movie is a very funny film and one of the best 'National Lampoon's' films	 it also has a very catchy spoof title	 which basically sums up what the whole movie is about.... Men In White!!!! The story is a spoof of many films including a Will Smith film	 as you might have guessed	 'Men In Black'. I will not give the ending away but it has a very good ending in is very funny (Leslie Nielsen style humour) from start to finish	 especially the bit near the beginning when thy are in the street collecting the dustbins (Garbage Cans). Also	 they have a pretty cool dustbin lorry (Garbage Collecting Truck) in that scene too. The acting is not superb	 actually	 it is not very good	 but that is what makes the film funny	 it is a comedy	 loosen up!! I love the story line	 partly because it is so far fetched and partly because it is interesting to see how subtle (Or should it be Un-subtle) they rip off all the other films. I am great fan of un-serious spoof films	 but i am also a fan of the real thing	 and with this films	 it is hard to decide which is better	 the film it mainly rips off (mentioned earlier i this review) or the actual film it is	 but also when you are actually making a spoof of comedy films	 it actually makes it even harder	 but this film carries it off successfully. The two garbage men are so funny	 it reminds me of a TV sketch show in the UK called 'Little Britain'. This film is a must for your collection and is one of the best	 most entertaining	 funniest	 best storyline	 National Lampoon's film to date!!"	1.0

"Who likes awful ""comedy"" shows like Little Mosque on the Prairie? The only two kinds of people I can think of who watch this are: One	 Muslims and self-proclaimed Liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about Muslims that it doesn't even matter if the show is good or funny at all (which it is not). Two	 old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable	 badly written	 stale jokes.<br /><br />CBC needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is. If they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen	 their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left. I'd be curious who even writes for this show? Do you think it's actually Muslims	 or hip	 funny young people? No	 I bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC shows since the 1960's.<br /><br />When you look at the CBC comedy shows there are	 Air Farce was only finally just taken off the air (thank goodness!) but we still have lame ducks like This Hour Has 22 Minutes and Rick Mercer that we are paying for	 not to mention this poor excuse for ""comedy"" Little Mosque on the Prairie. It is supposed to be offencive and funny? Only the CBC would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny. Shame on the CBC for squandering our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching."	0.0
"I think the biggest failing something can have is to be boring. Bad is actually better than boring. This thing has no breath. It does have the interesting fact of taking place in Cambodia. How many American made films of the 30's take place in Cambodia. Nevertheless	 the conflict there is a little hard to figure out. Even the troop movements are a little confusing. What drags it to a resounding halt is the love story. Why those two guys are so totally transfixed on the dippy blonde I don't know. I thought he should continue to use his Zombies (such as they are) and forget all about her. The movie just plods along. The perfect microcosm is where one of the principle characters follows a Cambodian priest through the water to get to the secret place where the hieroglyphics (or whatever) that explain how to turn people into zombies is kept. I thought they would never get there. One guy takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other guy hides behind some columns. He takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other guy hides behind some bushes. This is the movie in a nutshell. Then there is the bad acting and insipid dialogue. I actually have a lot of patience when it comes to B movies. This one is insufferable. By the way	 a more apt title would be Revolt of the Hypnotized."	0.0
"For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly respected novel	 this film will definitely impress you	 because of how honorable an adaptation it is . With the exception of one minor subplot	 Sturla Gunnarson's feature film debut is an almost dead-on recreation of the book (down to the last line).<br /><br />For those of you who have not read the novel	 this movie might be a little tricky. It is certainly not a large cinematic drama story. Instead it has a strong element of realism to it	 but I would not have it any other way. The best way to describe Such a Long Journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale	 Hindu version of 'Fiddler On The Roof'. Instead of a Jewish/Russian milkman	 the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in 1970's Bombay during the time of the Muslim/Hindi war with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life	 including his sick daughter	 his individualist eldest son	 a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money	 and an unhealthy neighborhood. The Ending is not a happy one	 nor is it a sad one	 but that is essentially what realism involves. <br /><br />Such a Long Journey is a fine little movie	 but if you want to see it	 then good luck finding it. Unlike the novel	 it has received very little release."	1.0
"After reading some very good reviews about this film I thought I would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film I thought I would give it my own review. This is my first ever so bare with me.<br /><br />First of all I would scratch horror from the genre as in no way is it horrific or scary in the slightest (with the exception of a few feeble attempts to make you jump unfortunately one of which worked on me.) I would say that calling this film a thriller is pushing it as I wasn't particularly thrilled either! The film is about a spoiled mischievous girl who faints a few times. During these times she visits a house which she has been drawing	 after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively one of the features being a sad little boy who is also ill in reality. As she befriends the boy she realises that her imaginary world that she created is actually better than the real world that she is in. Until she adds her constantly away father to the house	 due to a misdrawing her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his clutches.<br /><br />Think its an attempt to be a slightly more mellow version of A Nightmare On Elm Street but is more like a trip to the beach.<br /><br />In conclusion my generous 3/10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab!"	0.0
"The symbolic use of objects	 form editing	 the position of characters in the scene... these were all used with such joyous abandon by Hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had. The way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses	 the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger... while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards	 in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken. Even the title has a least four meanings that I can see; the boxing ring	 the wedding ring	 the bracelet the lover buys	 and the love triangle at the heart of the story."	1.0
"The cast is OK. The script is awkward at times	 and it takes a while to figure out what the point of the movie is. I found myself looking forward to doing the dishes. The Shehan bit is a cheesy statement on the war. I guess we were supposed to not notice it...we did. Its a house	 you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes. The shower part...huh? What was that about? Literally	 it is I have a client	 ""Ok you can use our shower."" Yawn. The angles are trying way to hard. There was a set of woods	 suddenly its gone cause you can see right through	 then next it is deep and animals are dying. In the end this is a horrendous movie of boring proportions."	0.0
"I love the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman. It is great! When Jim tosses that little person through the window	 the look on his face is priceless. Then when he starts to address the Priest in his wife's behalf only to find out that she has become the Pee-Woman? Great writing and great casting along with great acting makes this a must see. I am attempting to find a certain photo from that episode. I'd like to use it as my avatar on a message board because I think the Greenman is hilarious. Does anyone know where I can download a photo of Jim as the Greenman? Can anyone point me in the right direction to find such a photo?"	0.0
"Wealthy psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published her first novel and is feeling down about her profession feeling that it's hopeless to help her patients. A young gambling junkie client asks her to help him pay off his debts if he truly wants to help him get better. Here she gets involved with Joe Mantegna. To reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and 'House of Games' may very well be the best con movie I've seen. David Mamet wrote and directed this gem that's full of snappy dialogue	 great one-liners	 and enough twists to keep you guessing til the end. Crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needing a change and Mantegna tops her as the devilishly sly con-man. And with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie	 the film is in utter control of it's audience; and we are loving the con.<br /><br />*** out of ****"	1.0
"Pixar has had massive success over the years with the full-length CGI animated movies they have made. ""A Bug's Life"" was the second of a whole bunch of features they have made so far	 preceded by the company's feature-length debut	 the groundbreaking ""Toy Story""	 which was the first ever feature-length CGI movie. I remember when this follow-up was heavily advertised around the time of its release in the late 1990's	 but I never actually saw it until November 2006. I watched it twice that month	 and over three years later	 I have seen it a third time. It has never impressed me as much as probably any other Pixar film I've ever seen	 but after three viewings	 I still think it's better than some of the films I've seen from DreamWorks Animation.<br /><br />Ant Island is the home of a colony of ants. These ants are forced to gather food for a gang of grasshoppers who come and take it every year. One member of this colony is Flik	 an inventor with a bad reputation for causing trouble with his inventions	 even though he doesn't mean to. One year	 when the colony has just finished preparing the annual offering	 Flik accidentally knocks it into a stream just before the grasshoppers arrive to get it! The grasshopper leader	 Hopper	 decides to give them a second chance to gather food and have it ready by the end of the season	 but they will have to double their offering! Flik suggests to the colony's royal council that he goes and finds ""warrior bugs"" to fight off the grasshoppers when they come back. Princess Atta	 the future Queen	 lets him go on this mission just so he won't be around to cause trouble while the colony tries to gather food for another offering. The inventor finds a group of bugs which he thinks are warriors	 but after he takes them back to Ant Island and introduces them	 he learns that they are actually not warriors	 but circus bugs!<br /><br />The main reason why this second Pixar feature has never absolutely astounded me might be the characters. To me	 none of them have ever really stood out as much as they could have	 and generally seem a bit bland. Fortunately	 however	 it's not like ""Shark Tale""	 a film with a very idiotic and unlikable lead character. ""A Bug's Life"" does have a likable enough main character	 one which viewers can root for. The story also seems somewhat bland at times	 but for the most part	 it's good enough to keep the film at least moderately entertaining	 and sometimes has some good suspense	 especially later on. The humour	 like certain other aspects of the film	 isn't as good as it could have been	 but there are definitely funny moments	 some of them involving Francis	 a male ladybug who is sometimes mistaken for a female. You can always expect great animation from Pixar	 and the animation in this particular effort of theirs is no exception. With all this movie has to offer	 it may be slightly disappointing when it comes to Pixar standards	 but it is reasonable family entertainment."	1.0
"I found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle while I tried to make head or tail of who was fighting who and why. One of the problems is the cultural/language one. Here we have a Chinese/Taiwanese/Japanese problem of which we know little and because we are simply reading English subtitles inevitably loose some of the subtleties. Another problem is that there seem to be just too many only half explained twists and coincidences. Nevertheless	 it seems unlikely that there is a wholly bad Miiki film and this certainly is not that. Plenty of stylish and bone crunching violence	 a window upon some less than orthodox sexual goings on plus the family aspect. All in all a decent ride but maybe checking out the storyline might actually be helpful before watching this one."	1.0
"I recently watched the '54 version of this film with Judy	 and while i appreciated the story and music	 i found that the film failed to hold my attention. I expected the '76 remake to be the same story	 except with a Barbra twist. I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame	 money	 love and the price of it all. This version is so much more real than the '54 one	 with arguably better music	 better acting	 a more gripping plot line	 and	 of course	 a deeper love. I do not understand why the previous film is on the American Film Institute's top 100 list	 while this gripping remake fails to make a mark on any critic's list."	1.0
"I signed in just to comment on how awfully stupid this movie is. Besides being a rip-off of Executive Decision or Air Force One or any other kind of terrorist story	 this is the kind of movie that makes you appreciate seeing a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well. It's hard to blame the actors when they are given such a stupid	 cliché-ridden script to work with. It's bad enough if you groan once in a movie when you encounter an insult to your intelligence	 but when you find yourself groaning over and over again	 you have to conclude that the director also isn't the brightest bulb in the movie business	 nor are the producers for deciding to bring this story to the screen in the first place. The mostly low-rent actors you can excuse for taking on this assignment	 because they most likely showed up to get the money and exposure	 not that being a part of this joke-of-a-movie is going to earn them any awards or recognition. It may end up embarrassing them for having such poor judgment as to get involved in such a loser. I see no point in summarizing the plot or even in giving any examples to prove my case	 for	 to do so	 would be cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this debacle could withstand. Just as studying well-made movies can inspire you how to make a good	 skillfully put-together work of art and beauty	 the only thing that you can learn from watching this monstrosity is what NOT to do and what does NOT work! Be warned."	0.0
"As a member of the cast	 I was a member of the band at all the basketball games	 I would like to let the world know after being in the movie	 that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in Oregon. This was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the University of Oregon where it was shot. Seems that the U of O sign was shown. While we were shooting	 we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff. Mr Nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill-mannered men I have ever met. Quite a time for a young 20 year old. BUt certainly not what campus life was really like in the late 60's and early 70's despite what Hollywood may think. Trombone player from Oregon"	0.0
"Utterly predictable silly show about a man who has killed his wife by mowing her down when driving and claimed he had blacked out. Why was he still driving a car? Why did he still feel able to drive a car having killed his wife with one? This question has not occurred to the writers. The story then witters on about a psychologist and her failing marriage which is tied into the failing marriage of wife-killing blackout driver. An omniscient mother and one dimensional child are thrown in for good measure	 and the whole builds up to a predictable denouement and crashing finale. Are police psychologists so easily taken in? Deadful writing that the actors do their best with	 but they are doomed to failure. This is on a par with a Harlequin Romance. Don't waste your time watching this one unless that's what you are aiming for."	0.0
"Awwww....yes	 it is heartwarming and all that some unlucky family gets adopted by ABC/Sears and has their home ""renovated."" That's where the humanistic appeal ends. I liked it early in its run	 but now this show has become disgustingly excessive.<br /><br />Ten needy families could be given relatively luxurious homes with lots of goodies for every one family that each episode of this show splurges on. The people at Habitat For Humanity must be shaking their heads in disbelief. For example	 is it necessary for a healthy sixteen year old boy to have a jacuzzi in his bedroom	 or have his bed tricked-out with ""Low Rider"" hydraulics? Does the mom really need her dilapidated	 non-running and rusted out old pick-up truck restored and ""pimped"" by some of the best customizers in California? A new one would have done the job quite nicely	 and probably for a third of the price. Do people really need a sixty-five inch plasma screen in every room of the house? And then there's the issue of who pays the increased property taxes and utility bills. Even after the zaniacs at ""Makeover"" leave	 somebody still has earn a living. I doubt the friendly folks down at Social Services will see the humor in all of this largess.<br /><br />This show is nothing more than a ratings grabber for ABC	 and a tacit commercial for its sponsors."	0.0
"Pretty poor Firestarter clone that seems more like a bad TV movie than a bad feature film. How disappointing for this to come from Hooper and Dourif!<br /><br />Government contractors do a human experiment with a Hydrogen bomb. The boy born to the couple from the experiment constantly runs a fever of 100 degrees	 and when he's an adult	 people in his life start spontaneously combusting. He tries to find out why.<br /><br />The people completely on fire are well done	 but when they get to the point that they are well done in another sense	 they're obviously changed to dummies. When jets of fire shoot out of characters' arms	 it looks silly rather than alarming the way it should. Also ridiculous is fire that evidently travels through phone lines and erupts in huge jets from the receiver's earpiece. How is that supposed to happen	 exactly?<br /><br />Something else that struck me as silly about the movie is when a character has visions of his late parents. We later see the exact same shots from those visions in home movies."	0.0
"I like musicals but as a Dickens fan I HATE this one. **MILD SPOILERS** Starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workhouse? The poor of London coming out to sing? Fagin and Dodger walking off into the sunset? Not exactly faithful to the novel. As I recall	 Dodger was publicly hanged and Fagin went crazy in prison. **END OF SPOILERS**<br /><br />Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes	 doing little more than growling to indicate his evil. Worst however	 is Mark Lester as Oliver	 who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if he's really the main character. His portrayal is in no way helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is dub in the voice of a girl. Guess they didn't realize that boy trebles can be found in almost every church in England.<br /><br />Self-respecting Dickens fans: stick to David Lean's amazing 1948 film or the BBC 6-hour adaptation from the mid-80's. Avoid this bloated whitewash of a musical."	0.0

I read all the reviews here AFTER watching this piece of cinematic garbage and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that somebody else didn't think that this appallingly unfunny montage WASN'T the acme of humour in the 70s or indeed in any other era! If this isn't the least funny set of sketch *comedy* I've ever seen it'll do till it comes along. Half of the skits had already been done (and infinitely better) by acts such as Monty Python and Woody Allen... If I was to say that a nice piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlight of this film it would still not get close to summing up just how mindless and drivel-ridden this waste of 75 minutes is. Seminal comedy? Only in the world where seminal really DOES mean semen. Scatological humour? Only in a world where scat IS actually feces. Precursor jokes? Only if by that we mean that this is a handbook of how NOT to do comedy. Tits and bums and the odd beaver. Nice...if you are a pubescent boy with at least one hand free and haven't found out that Playboy exists. Give it a break because it was the early 70s? No way. There had been sketch comedy going back at least ten years prior. The only way I could even forgive this film even being made is if it was at gunpoint. Retro? Hardly. Sketches about clowns subtly perverting children may be cutting edge in some circles (and it could actually have been funny) but it just comes off as really quite sad. What kept me going throughout the entire 75 minutes? Sheer belief that they may have saved a genuinely funny skit for the end. I gave the film a 1 because there was no lower score...and I can only recommend it to insomniacs or coma patients...or perhaps people suffering from lockjaw...their jaws would finally drop open in disbelief.	0.0
"What to say about this movie. Well it is about a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and turn into delinquent students that sell more of the bad drugs to people. Two of those people have adverse effects as one turns into a toxic avenger type and his girlfriend throws up some creature that grows in the school's basement. That is about all there is to it and they stretch it out for 84 minutes. This movie is pretty bad and should be locked away forever. Though that is not fair	 some people like Troma's movies and they can watch it if they want. Troma movies for me though	 are the worst movies there are out there. I just watched this one out of morbid curiosity."	0.0
"A lot of other reviewers here	 including many whose opinions I respect	 hold this slice of European sleaze horror in high regard. Personally	 I didn't like it at all. Its an incoherent attempt at a atmospheric period cross between sex and violence. Jess Franco at his best makes these kinds of films very well. Unfortunately	 the infamous exploitation filmmaker Joe D'Amato does not. D'Amato's most well known films are infamous for their high gross-out quotient. This	 an early film by him	 doesn't have the constant disgusting scenes that his more notorious ""Anthropophagous"" and ""Beyond the Darkness"" did. Ultimately	 its an incoherent film that doesn't manage to involve the viewer in any way. Without the sleaze factor either	 it becomes very boring. As I said	 others have enjoyed this film	 but I just found it to be a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing.<br /><br />There are a few pluses for the film. Ewa Aulin (from ""Candy"") is in it	 and she looks pretty hot and is often naked. However	 cult film icon Klaus Kinski is completely wasted in a subplot with no connection to the main film. He seems bored with the role and doesn't have the manic intensity he does at his finest. The music score is nice and there are some brief moments of unintentionally funny gore. Still	 this is a pretentious and pointless film that manages to be incredibly boring. (3/10)"	0.0
"Critics need to review what they class as a quality movie. I think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the Matrix style of films. Europa is a breath of fresh air	 a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film. Lars von Trier shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension. The back projection effect he uses during the film arouses and enhances the characters	 and the focus of the conversation they are having. Other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like Hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene. The commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect	 again maintaining the focus on the central characters in the scene and there actions.<br /><br />I could talk about the effects more but I think you all would agree they push this film into a category of its own	 and really heighten the drama of the film. A film to buy if you don't own already and one to see if you have not.<br /><br />10/10 Don't miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film directors."	1.0
"Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi made many films together	 but on the whole (interestingly enough) Karloff usually is the better man of the two. The real exception is ""The Black Cat"" (1934) where Karloff is playing the evil head of a devil cult	 and Lugosi is seeking revenge on him for destroying his life. But more usual is ""Black Friday""	 where (whatever his motive) Karloff is trying to improve brain surgery while Lugosi is a murderous thug. In ""The Raven"" Lugosi is a sadistic surgeon	 who blackmails Karloff to assist his evil plans until Karloff finally has had enough. Rarely are they both negative characters totally. In ""The Body Snatcher""	 Karloff does kill Lugosi	 but Lugosi is trying to blackmail him.<br /><br />The one exception where they are both extremely sympathetic but at cross purposes to each other is this 1936 film	 which I feel has rarely had the audience acceptance of some of the other movies I have mentioned. In it Karloff's Dr. Janos Rukh is a hard driven scientific genius who has been sneered at by the ""official scientific community"" for his theory that a rare form of Radium is in Nigeria on a meteorite that landed centuries ago. He has finally gotten the support of a well financed expedition led by Sir Francis Stevens and his wife Lady Arabella Stevens (Walter Kingsford and Beulah Bondi)	 and has another scientist	 a Frenchman named Dr. Felix Benet (Lugosi)	 Rukh's young wife Diane (Frances Drake) and a friend and protégée of the Stevenses named Ronald Drake (Frank Lawton).<br /><br />Before they leave	 Rukh is warned by his mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) that he is possibly seeking wisdom that he shouldn't and it may end in tragedy. He tries to dismiss this	 but he is worried by what she says	 his scientific standing	 and whether or not he is going to get his due credit.<br /><br />What he gets is a disaster. He finds the substance	 but is infected by it's remarkable radioactivity. He finds that he is slowly burning up	 and if he tries to touch people or animals they die. He's actually built up a friendship or understanding with Benet	 who figures out a type of radioactive fighting cocktail for Rukh to use to counter the danger. But there are two things that are unbeatable here. The antidote can only last for a certain amount of time	 and has to be replenished. And the radioactivity has affected Rukh's brain. He is increasingly jealous of Diane's friendship with Ronald (encouraged	 unfortunately by Sir Francis and Lady Arabella)	 and he is equally upset that (due to his having to pretend to have died - the effects of the radioactivity are like that) Benet and several others are collecting the kudos of the wonders that ""Radium X"" is giving to man. Soon Rukh is on a murderous rampage that destroys many lives	 ending with his own.<br /><br />The film certainly picked up on science to an extent. Madame Curie had died recently from cancer she got due to work with Radium. Few fully understood the dangers of radioactivity in 1936	 but some idea of it was coming out. The wave of murders by Rukh cause the newspapers to talk about a ""curse"" on the expedition. Of course	 with the idea of a ""cursed"" expedition (on the continent of Africa) for a hidden treasure buried centuries ago	 financed by a titled Englishman	 we have entered archeology not physics or geology (paging Howard Carter and Lord Carnaevon).<br /><br />On the other hand	 Benet tries to settle the cause of the string of deaths	 and reverts to an idea that was actually demolished in 1888 in England. During the Whitechapel Murders	 Sir Charles Warren ordered the retinas of several of the dead victims to be photographed to see if the last image on the retinas was Jack the Ripper. It turned out he only got the photographs of the retinas of dead prostitutes. But the idea did not die. Jules Verne used it in his novel ""The Brothers Kip"" in 1899	 and here Dr. Benet uses it. As this is a science fiction story	 he finds the image of Rukh on the the plate	 but Benet drops the plate accidentally and it shatters.<br /><br />The film is good on many grounds	 the most interesting that for a change Karloff and Lugosi are not unsympathetic towards each other. There is a type of tragic fatalism in this story that is missing from their other films. The other performances are good as well	 in particular Ms Kemble Cooper. She is best remembered as Basil Rathbone's frightening sister (Jane Murdstone) in ""David Copperfield"". Here her final act is the only way to bring this tragedy to an end	 and who can say it did not hurt her more than her target."	1.0
"This show stinks. For parents	 they usually want their kids to watch something good for them. It is usually educational	 funny	 and bright.<br /><br />Is it educational? No. the Doodlebops sing and that's it. They usually sing about themselves	 they don't try teaching anything.<br /><br />Is it funny? No. The Doodlebops instead say something which is not intended as a joke	 and laugh at it.<br /><br />Is it bright? It's so bright	 it's painful. As far as color	s everything is extremely bright	 so that's good. But NOTHING is ever wrong in the world of the Doodlebop's. Therefore	 they are always happy. a kid in trouble will become depressed because they have never been exposed to being sad.<br /><br />The show is also extremely cheesy. Every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny. It's overkill.<br /><br />For kids	 it's entertaining	 but past the age of 2 you won't want your kids to see it. They'll never know how to grow up."	0.0
"Some of the acting was a bit suspect. I remember that asswipe Alexander Walker (Evening Standard critic	 yeah OK	 he's now dead) launched into a rant about this film saying it was a disgrace portraying NI Protestants as murderers. Now with respect to all NI protestants	 this film was loosely based on the Shankill Butchers (who were loyalists)and who roamed Belfast in the 1970's. Believe me	 they were not called butchers for nothing. my main moan about this film is the it shows no ray of light or hope	 it's all doom & gloom	 i mean did the little girl at the end have to die. Maybe this sounds corny but it could have taken the tact that not all Prods & tiags are bad or wholly good either."	1.0
"It was the Sixties	 and anyone with long hair and a hip	 distant attitude could get money to make a movie. That's how Michael Sarne	 director of this colossal flop	 was able to get the job. Sarne is one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie. In fact	 the whole studio must have been tricked into agreeing to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film	 a terribly precious 60's-hip black and white featurette called Joanna. That film starred the similarly talentless actress/waif Genevieve Waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat-like twitter. Sarne	 who was probably incapable of directing a cartoon	 never mind a big-budget Hollywood film	 was in way over his head. David Giler's book is the best place to go to find out how the faux-infant terrible Sarne was able to pull the wool over everyone's eyes. If there is ever an historical marker which indicates the superficiality and shallowness of an era	 Myra Breckinridge provides that marker. It embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea-change in the body politic. Breckinridge is a touchstone of another	 equally important vein. Watch this movie and you'll get a different perspective on the less-often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years.<br /><br />Many reviewers have spoken about the inter-cutting of footage from other films	 especially older ones. Some actually liked these clunky ""comments"" on what was taking place in the movie	 others found them senseless	 annoying	 and obtrusive	 though since the film is so bad itself any intrusion would have to be an improvement. <br /><br />In my opinion	 the real reason Michael Sarne put so many film clips into Myra Brekinridge was to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed. That is to say	 Sarne was so imagination-challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time. They weren't inspiration	 they were desperation. His writing skills were nonexistent	 and David Giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb	 so Sarne was left to actually try and make a movie	 and he couldn't. It was beyond his slim capabilities. Hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film's worth of clips. The ghosts of writers and directors - many long since passed on - were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because Sarne sure as heck wasn't able to. This was what he came up with on those days he sat on the set and thought for eight hours while the entire cast and crew (not to mention the producers and the accountants) cooled their heels and waited for something	 some great spark of imagination	 a hint of originality	 a soupcon of wit	 to crackle forth from the brow of Zeus. Um	 oops. No Zeus + no imagination + no sparks = millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings - each made from the hundreds of licensing agreements required to use the clips - flying out the window. Bye-bye. <br /><br />As for myself	 I hated the film clips. They denigrated Sarne's many betters	 poked fun at people whose talents - even those whose skills were not great - far outstripped the abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration	 originality - and even of plain competency - compared to even the cheesiest of them."	0.0
"The only reason I rented this was because of the article in Fangoria Magazine. The article made this film look interesting. Well	 it isn't. This was a very boring	 amateurishly written and directed movie. All the actors in this movie are awful	 except Faye Dunaway	 who is always a joy to watch. But too much time was focused on Gina Phillips and her ridiculous encounters with ravens and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has such a thick Argentinean accent	 you can only understand every couple of words he says. Also on hand is Nicholas Pauls	 who plays the ultra-bland love interest to Gina Phillips. The bottom line: this movie is not scary. There is only one good scene and that is the last five to ten minutes of the movie. I would have given this one star	 but I gave it three just because I like Faye Dunaway so much. But even she wasn't that great in this."	0.0
"Have you ever sat watching a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have gone by and suddenly you realize that you have actually seen the movie before? That happened to me with ""The Young Graduates"". The cover of the video box	 if you can find the video	 is extremely deceiving. I'd swear that the two women on the cover aren't even in the film.<br /><br />Anyway	 I was either born a decade too late to appreciate the finer points of this film or...it is simply pointless junk. I'm heavily leaning toward the latter but I guess some out there have developed a connection to this movie.<br /><br />Hmm...plot. A plot. Let's see...there must be a plot around here somewhere. Nope	 I can't find it. It's pretty much about some high school seniors acting dopey and doing drugs and speaking in a language that became outdated decades ago. One of the female students has a crush on her teacher. The teacher has a frigid wife (whom he indeed refers to as an iceberg) so he is receptive to the girl's advances.<br /><br />There's a lot of driving around and inane dialogue and plenty of spastic dancing. Our cat	 BooBoo	 was transfixed by the dancing high school kids. She watched with amazing intensity as the dancers gyrated and shook out on the dance floor. It's nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic. 1/10"	0.0
"Watched both parts twice. Enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older Patrick Swayze as the hero. He was very believable as the hunter Alan Quartermaine and certainly bested the performance of Richard Chamberlain. I do admit that I would have preferred seeing someone else as the ""Lady in Distress"". Alison Doody should stick with modern and not period pieces. She didn't have the look of the woman of the 1800's. The rest of the cast were terrific and followed the plotlines very well. I am glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid to be seen as getting older. Age is inevitable	 but let's not hide from it. A man at 50+ can be much sexier (and 	 Patrick truly is sexy) then a green youth	 no matter how pretty. Hoorah for character lines to go along with a great smile."	1.0
"Some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good - 23rd Century films released dozens of obscure Italian and American movie that were great	 but although Hardgore released some Fulci films amongst others	 the bulk of their output is crap like The Zombie Chronicles.<br /><br />The only positive thing I can say about this film is that it's nowhere near as annoying as the Stink of Flesh. Other than that	 its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a Lego house built by a whelk.<br /><br />It's been noted elsewhere	 but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence	 so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks	 you've seen it all already.<br /><br />Bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18	000 continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast (especially the hitchhiker	 who was so bad he did make me laugh a bit)	 and kudos to Hardgore for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like I was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip.<br /><br />Awful	 awful stuff.

"Some may feel that the rating i have just given is a bit generous	 but for what this film is i think the directors have done a good job with that they had available to them	 this is also a film a film of an acquired taste! <br /><br />my immediate thought was the direct connection to the classic cult film 'The Thing' i.e the parasitical aliens from outta space	 infesting human host to then reek havoc wherever possible!<br /><br />You can see how this film pays homage to such a film and others of the horror/gore genre	 however cleverly maintains its own originality	 well these things fight each other for one and then continue to eat then fallen rival!

It is low budget and yes it is blood thirsty	 with the creatures/aliens/things morphing their limbs into crude looking weapons	 i.e saws	 drills	 blades and even the odd gun to all but decimate there opponent. I found myself cringing at what i was being shown but at the same time glued to the screen wondering what was going to happen next!<br /><br />So if you like gore	 you like aliens	 you like fighting and even maybe a little bit of love thrown in somewhere	 then i must recommend this film as a must see. I just wish i came across this earlier then i did!"	1.0
"In a way	 Corridors of Time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal : being seen by thousands. But it fails at making them laugh...<br /><br />Les Visiteurs has had its success	 because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel : forget about Zemeckis's Back to the future	 here comes the old France	 the middle-age knight and its nearly barbaric way of life. Full of pride	 funny thanks to the ancient words he uses	 Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor. Then comes the sequel.<br /><br />Nobody had foreseen the tremendous success of Les Visiteurs	 the first. And it's no use being a movie expert to realize that the Corridors of Time has been made for money.<br /><br />The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs	 and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time paradox that would have needed some second tought. Explanation : it's no use trying to get back the jewelry Jacquouille has stolen ; don't you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode ? Where do you think he found the money ? Selling the jewelry... And that's only one of many holes Poiré tries to avoid... and fails.<br /><br />Let's have a look at the characters : Montmirail doesn't change	 he's just a little more boring. Regarding Frenegonde... that's another story : Valérie Lemercier decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeoise role. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I found so pitiful I nearly felt pain for her. And Poiré doesn't realize that a cast of humorists isn't enough to make a good comedy.<br /><br />Forget about the time travels	 about the digital effects	 concentrate on the story and you'll see that there's enough room on a mail stamp to write it 10 times.<br /><br />The main interest of this film is the landscapes. A movie for youngsters	 let's say up to 13 years old."	0.0
"Classic	 highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director Carpenter and star Curtis.<br /><br />Seemingly unstoppable murderer escapes from mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to stalk a local babysitter on Halloween.<br /><br />Halloween is a film that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! Carpenter's frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that it must be seen to really be felt! The direction often consists of such simple elements	 shadows	 dark streets	 creaking doors	 that it makes even the everyday setting of a small town neighborhood truly creepy. Carpenter well-times his suspense and his jolting shocks to make them the most effectively startling	 that in itself is a feat few horror filmmakers ever manage! Plus	 he is wise enough to give us some truly likable young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension all the more strong. Highest kudos also go to Carpenter's simple	 yet frighteningly unnerving music score. In a sense	 Halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror film!<br /><br />The cast is excellent. Young Jamie Lee Curtis does a very nice turn as lovable babysitter Laurie Strode	 she's so good that she would go on to be in a number of other horror films before breaking into bigger films. The great Donald Pleasants does a perfect performance as a Myer's doctor	 who's desperate to capture him again. Supporting cast Loomis	 Soles	 Castle	 and others are good too.<br /><br />So like its own villain	 Halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to thrill and chill. It is a MUST for all genre fans!<br /><br />**** out of ****"	1.0
"The story of the boy thief of Bagdad (as it was once spelled) has attracted filmmakers from Raoul Walsh in 1924	 who starred Douglas Fairbanks in the first	 silent	 rendering of ""Thief of Bagdad	"" to less imposing	 more recent attempts. The best	 however	 remains 1940's version which for its time was a startling	 magical panoply of top quality special effects. Those effects still work their charm.<br /><br />No less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred Sabu as the boy thief	 Abu	 John Justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch	 Ahmad and June Duprez as the lovely princess sought by Ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier	 Jaffar	 played by a sinister Conrad Veidt. The giant genie is ably acted by Rex Ingram.<br /><br />Ahmad is treacherously deposed by Jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent	 he and the boy	 Abu	 suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates. Ahmad is rendered blind and Abu becomes a lovable mutt. Their adventures through the gaily decorated Hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work.<br /><br />Two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado-like black swirl: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard	 incidentally	 did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film. Both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry.)<br /><br />Duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting. Justin's Ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses. Sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he's very good. For a movie meant for kids as well as adults there's a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind. Still	 I don't think anyone under eight ought to see ""Thief of Bagdad.""<br /><br />This film makes periodic appearances on TV but today my teenage son and I saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present. It was great to see computer-besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them.<br /><br />""Thief of Bagdad"" is a pre-war Hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases. This is one of the best of its kind.<br /><br />9/10."	1.0

"No doubt intended as a totally campy joke	 ""Full Moon High"" portrays 1950s teenager Tony Walker (Adam Arkin) accompanying his father (Ed McMahon) on a trip to Romania. Sure enough	 Tony gets bitten	 and grows fur and fangs whenever there's a full moon. A particularly interesting aspect in this movie is that he can't age as long as he has the werewolf curse	 and that he has to fulfill a destiny - even if it takes twenty years.<br /><br />But otherwise	 the movie's just plain funny once it gets going. Ed McMahon's character is an over-patriotic right-wing yahoo (he thinks that everyone should have listened to Joe McCarthy)	 Kenneth Mars's coach/principal is a tense dweeb	 and then there's more. One of the most eye-opening cast members is Demond Wilson - best remembered as Lamont on ""Sanford and Son"" - as a bus driver who gets a big surprise. But probably the funniest scene is the changing of the presidents; then gag with Gerald Ford really summed him up! Anyway	 it's a real treat. Considering that Alan Arkin - who plays a zany psychiatrist - just won an Oscar on Sunday night and thanked his sons	 I wonder whether or not he remembers co-starring with two of them in this movie (aside from Adam	 his son Anthony also has a small role). Quite funny. Also starring Elizabeth Hartman.<br /><br />PS: director Larry Cohen is probably best known for the killer baby flick ""It's Alive""."	1.0
"Shortly after seeing this film I questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role. Elizabeth Shue is a commendable actress	 why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity? I must give credit where credit is due	 though. Some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing	 but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of Kevin Bacon's character	 Sebastian Caine. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone	 man or woman	 that has any form of self-respect to account for."	0.0
"Shecky	 is a god damned legend	 make no mistake. Until recently I worked for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain	 running their testing department. We would go through many new starters	 they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores. Now to tortu^^^^^ test the resolve of these new staff members	 we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift	 got round to sending their DVD player back	 they never failed to send Shecky back also. Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with.<br /><br />Now	 as to why this film is so bad	 where do I begin?<br /><br />Adam Sandler	 who can be so	 so very funny	 as in Happy Gilmore	 or the Wedding Singer	 must have been having one hell of an off day. The rest of the crew stank	 and what is it with Billy Zane? His name crops up in several of the worst movies of all time	 and he is a decent actor. Crazy. The production quality is absolute zero.<br /><br />I would have been inclined to give this a zero if I could	 because they didn't even have the guts to call it by it's full name 'The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz' on release. Even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far Sandler has come	 and just how low he can go."	0.0
"Even though an animated film it really bored everyone under at least 6.<br /><br />As a grown up who grew up in an area with wild horses and native americans	 it felt this was a combination of PC mixed in with too many fantasy films created by people who never lived in the area they filmed about. Talk to those who have lived on horse back	 most treat their animals like family members	 regardless of background. Regardless of background we have dealt with good and bad breakers of wild horses. I had to explain that was a real life issues to us vs the movie makers views to children who were surprised to see how PC showed a world different than what they knew in reality.<br /><br />This dreamworks break from the normal disney or dreamworks fare of cute talking animals burning up the screen was nice from the older viewer point of view. But if you live in an area similar to what is shown	 you may end up answering questions."	0.0

"This was a pretty good film. I'm not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment	 but I didn't want to take a chance. Anyway	 near the end of the film	 the prosecutor reads a Scripture verse and then quotes another from memory. I can't remember the first passage he reads	 but the second one is Genesis 9:6. He says it's Genesis 9:12	 but he actually quotes verse 6. This is a common passage that many use to defend capital punishment. It's too bad that prosecutors dare not quote the Bible today. Did anybody ever hear of John Jay	 the first Supreme Court justice in the history of this country? He said that the Bible is the best of all books. Too bad we've lost that view in America."	1.0
"The nearest I ever came to seeing this was a clip shown at a Gerard Philippe exposition in Paris about two years ago. I had no interest in the remake and having just caught up with the original just over half a century after it was made I can only conclude that the inept fencing was intentional	 aimed at a long obsolete target. Hollywood had been doing realistic sword fights since the 30s when the greatest of them all	 Basil Rathbone	 crossed foils with Errol Flynn and others so the technique was available and so that leaves only satire. After a while you don't notice and revel in the Henri Jeanson dialogue reminiscent of the Prisoner Of Zenda	 both versions. Gerard Philippe certainly had the presence to bring off a role like this and Gina Lollabrigida was probably a tad better than Martine Carol	 the other obvious candidate at the time. The print I saw was particularly bad and at one point broke down completely so maybe a DVD version would enhance it."	1.0
"I live in Ottawa where this film was made and I really wish it hadn't been. This is one God-awful flick. I really try and support independent films but there is this stigma attached to anything indie and that stigma is: Indie Films Blow. Well	 this film does nothing to shed this curse. The actor	 writer	 director Brett Kelly does little to contribute to the genre	 rather he re-hashes tired clichés from movies past. I am really tired of menacing evil looking characters that lurk in the shadows and prey on the unsuspecting	 it's way too overdone. <br /><br />I can remember one scene in particular right near the end of the flick where the whole scene is lit with car headlights. Now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension	 but sadly it was to showcase the shoestring budget of this movie. As well for a movie that dares to call itself horror	 a viewer will find themselves hard pressed to find any actual gore	 other than a few scenes with corn syrup and red food colouring. <br /><br />The biggest thing that drags this film down is the pacing and the lack of character development	 the basic plot is that children are being kidnapped and the parents must track down this Bonesetter fellow before a certain time in order to get their kids back. Not that this concept bugs me	 but	 I didn't really find it believable that when the two main characters	 both who have lost children can find time to make out with each other. This is done in such a short time span that it's inconceivable	 my first priority would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the lady before making out with her. <br /><br />The last point that I have is.... and I won't hold this against Kelly	 but the movie is shot entirely on boring	 emotionless video and that really takes away from any tense moments that would have just oozed style on film. Although if this movie were given a million dollar makeover and redone the story and boring acting and lame everything could not keep this movie afloat. My only hope is that something happens to prevent Brett Kelly from making a sequel	 which has been reported on his website	 a sequel that was half written in one sitting. <br /><br />Lord help us all."	0.0
"That 70s Show is the best TV show ever	 period. It's up there with the Andy Griffen Show	 Saturday Night Live	 and The Simpsons in my book. That 70s Show continued on for 8 seasons	 all of which focus around a group of teenagers/young adults dealing with relationships	 separating from their parents	 and their overall futures.<br /><br />The two main characters	 Eric and Donna	 are two teenagers living next door to each other. They have been living next door to each other for most of their lives	 and just begin to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season. A large amount of the show revolves around how their relationship is working.<br /><br />Two other characters	 Red and Kitty	 are Eric's parents. Red was in the service	 so he really pushes Eric around. Kitty is just the opposite. Even though she drinks heavily	 she treats Eric and his friends with a lot of care. Bob	 their neighbor	 is obviously Donna's Dad. Bob giggles around with several different women throughout the coarse of the show's story. Bob also annoys Red to his full extent.<br /><br />The remaining character	 Hyde	 Kelso	 Fez	 and Jackie	 are Eric's friends. They also play a major role in the show's story.<br /><br />Well	 the First Season is great. This is when the characters are beginning to feel new things for each other. The First Season is original	 funny	 and enjoyable.<br /><br />The Second Season is good	 although it isn't as good as the first. It is a basic continuation of the First. Eric and Donna are together	 and everything is working out great.<br /><br />The Third Season is my favorite. It went back and captured the First Season feel and humor. I also think that the character chemistry improved a bunch	 making the show all that more fun to watch.<br /><br />The Fourth Season isn't near as good. Eric and Donna Arne't together in this one	 making the show slightly less pleasurable. It is still funny	 although I didn't enjoy it as much as the previous seasons.<br /><br />The Fifth Season is the last season I enjoyed all the way through. It is the gang's Senior Year	 so that really helps with the story. The Fifth Season also had the best ending out of all the seasons.<br /><br />The Sixth Season is good for the most part. It is extremely funny	 although it doesn't capture the feel that the other seasons did. The gang is out of High School	 so I believe that it didn't hit the teen feel that the previous seasons did. I also didn't like the last three or four episodes considering that they had a major drama feel to them.<br /><br />The Seventh Season captures the same feel that the 5th season had in a way	 although it didn't do it all the way. I enjoyed the Seventh Season as I did all the others	 and the ending is great.<br /><br />The Last Season flat out sucked. Eric wasn't in it	 which ruined it. Kelso wasn't in it for the most part either	 which didn't help. I hated the Eighth Season up until the last episode. I thought that the last episode was really good	 and a fitting ending to the series.<br /><br />So overall	 if you enjoy comedy	 give That 70s Show a try. They stopped making new episodes	 but it is still on TV a bunch. I also recommend buying Seasons 1-7. It is up to you if you want to buy Season 8."	1.0
"Strange how less than 2 hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such flat	 uninspiring drivel. If a story is as personal as this supposedly was to Sally Potter	 wouldn't you expect a little passion to show through in her performance? Her acting was completely detached and I felt no chemistry between Sally and Pablo and the tango scenes	 which should have been fiery given the nature of the dance	 were instead awkward and painful to watch. Obviously	 revealing such a personal story on film can be daunting	 and as such Sally Potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own sheepishness."	0.0

The acting was below-average and i felt this movie just went on and on about nothing but a bunch of unfunny jokes and a predictable plot.<br /><br />All in all	 one of the worse movies i've seen of 2006	 unfunny	 bad acting	 just ugly.<br /><br />Well thank god a friend shouted me. <br /><br />Avoid."	0.0
"This	 and Immoral Tales	 both left a bad taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted by sex	 and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you do have sex. As a film	 it's not very well done -- some of the acting is truly epically bad (such as the ""American"" woman with the French accent). The young woman's sudden flip-flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested (when it seems like it should have been the other way around)	 and the aunt's sudden realization of the young man's secret don't make sense -- they're not explained at all. I also didn't like how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family's perversion or predilection for bestiality. The central idea	 the idea that there's this ""sexy beast	"" if you will	 that lives in the woods	 could have been a foundation for a perverse but fun story	 but instead is just used as a basis for a nasty	 sex-negative	 morality play."	0.0
"At least the seats in the theater were comfortable and I ate the pop corn as loud as possible to drown out the inferior dialogue. This is absolutely not a girls film.

I've seen many	 many movies but this one is the new winner in the bad category. If you do happen to see it	 the one thing you'll look forward to is the ending.

All i see is a bunch of unintelligent surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture i don't know or want to know about... The challenges are pathetic and silly. The whole point of reality TV is to show REALITY. If you set a 'challenge' don't make them play with exaggerated props of food and stereotypical cultural elements in 'friday night games'. make them do an actual challenge.

"The key to The 40-Year-Old Virgin is not merely that Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin	 but rather the manner in which Steve Carell presents him as one. In a genre of crass ""comedy"" that has become typified by its lack of humor and engaging characters	 The 40-Year-Old Virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent	 heartfelt script that doesn't use its protagonist as the butt-end of cruel jokes. That Andy is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke	 in fact	 as it is a curiosity.<br /><br />Carell	 a veteran of Team Ferrell in Anchorman and an ex-Daily Show castmember	 uses the concept of the film to expand his character  we get to understand why Andy is the way he is. It's the little things that make this film work. When Andy's co-worker at an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend	 Andy describes his failed efforts at cooking. When Andy rides his bike to work	 he signals his turns. He doesn't just adorn his home with action figures  he paints them	 and talks to them	 and reveals that some of the really old ones have belonged to him since childhood. A lesser comedy wouldn't even begin to focus on all of these things.<br /><br />The plot is fairly simplistic  Andy's co-worker pals find out he's never had sex and they make it a personal quest of theirs to get him in bed with a woman. It's a childish idea and the film makes no attempt to conceal its juvenility.<br /><br />Andy's friends are a complement to his neurotic nature: David (Paul Rudd) has broken up with his girlfriend over two years ago but is still obsessed with her	 Jay (Romany Malco) is a womanizing ladies' man and Cal (Seth Rogen) is a tattooed sexaholic. Their attempts at getting Andy in the sack backfire numerous times	 and each time leaves Andy feeling less and less optimistic.<br /><br />Finally Andy meets single mom Trish (played by Catherine Keener) and	 much to the chagrin of his worrying buddies who claim mothers aren't worth it	 he falls in love with her. They begin a relationship and agree to put off having sex for twenty days  Trish being unaware that Andy is still a virgin.<br /><br />The 40-Year-Old Virgin was directed by Judd Apatow	 the man who produced Anchorman and The Cable Guy	 and began the short-lived cult TV show Freaks and Geeks. Apatow is renowned for his unique sense of humor	 and the script  co-written by Carell  offers plenty.<br /><br />However	 in the end the most interesting and (indeed surprising) aspect of The 40-Year-Old Virgin is its maturity. By now you are probably well aware that the film received glowing reviews from the critics	 and even I was surprised by its warm reception. But after seeing the film	 it's easy to understand why. We like Andy. We care about him. He's not just some cardboard cutout sex-comedy cliché  he's a real	 living	 breathing person. His neurotic traits combine the best of Woody Allen with childish naivety. His friends are not unlikable jerks and his romance is tumultuous and bittersweet. It strikes a chord with the audience.<br /><br />Although this is far from being a perfect movie and definitely contains some rather crude innuendo and sexual humor	 it doesn't offend to the extent that other genre entries might have because we have affection for the people on-screen. The best sex comedies work this way  from Risky Business to American Pie  and that is the major difference between something like The 40-Year-Old Virgin and 40 Days and 40 Nights."	1.0
"Man With the Gun is pretty much forgotten now	 but caused a minor storm of media interest back in 1955 when Robert Mitchum turned down both Jett Rink in Giant (which had actually been written for him and which was subsequently substantially reworked) and Charles Laughton's intended version of The Naked and the Dead to make it instead. Despite some obvious production problems and some harsh lighting that occasionally renders both Mitch and Jan Sterling in unflattering tones	 it's a terrific dark western that more than stands comparison with his earlier Blood on the Moon as his 'town tamer' sets to work on a town that never had the chance to grow up before getting run down by the local badmen before turning out to  possibly  be almost as bad as the men he dispatches. Certainly his way of dealing with news of a death in the family  burning a saloon to the ground and goading its manager into trying to kill him  doesn't inspire much confidence in his stability. As well as a good script and a surprisingly good supporting turn from the usually irritating but here well cast Henry Hull	 it also boasts a strikingly good early Alex North score	 which even includes an early workout for one of his tormented emotional cues that would later turn up in Spartacus."	1.0
"Oh	 boy	 God bless the 1970's	 we got some of the most horrific movies that came out of that decade: The Exorcist	 Jaws	 The Texas Chainsaw Massacre	 Halloween and now	 Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure. This movie must be used to torture captured terrorists into telling us about their evil plans to destroy the world	 I mean seriously	 this movie scared the heck out of me. My sister had this movie in her VHS collection and I was kind of curious what kind of movie they would make out of a doll that came out of the great depression for kids with very little pocket money. What the heck? It's kinda funny how this movie is the 1970's version of Toy Story	 pretty much down to a key	 only this was a thousand times scarier	 Disney had Alice in Wonderland to get into the drug trips for the children.<br /><br />Whenever Marcella leaves the room	 Raggedy Ann	 along with her brother Raggedy Andy and a whole nursery full of colorful toys come to life. On Marcella's birthday	 a new doll	 Babette	 arrives from Paris	 France to the United States of America. Babette is a spoiled creature who is unaware she is a doll	 but the friendly Raggedy Ann does everything she can to make Babette feel at home. However	 the pirate Captain Contagious kidnaps her. Raggedy Ann and Andy set off to try to rescue her before Marcella discovers Babette is gone. Out in the world outside the nursery	 the two meet the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees	 a blue toy camel who has been cast off by past owners and is now heartbroken and lonely. After Raggedy Ann and Andy hitch a ride on the Camel	 he begins to follow his hallucinations and without looking	 runs over the edge of a cliff	 into a deep pit. In this pit they encounter the Greedy	 who is a giant gluttonous blob of taffy who eats constantly and is never full. The Raggedys and the Camel narrowly escape being consumed by the Greedy and continue their journey to find Babette and believe me	 it just gets weirder from this point on.<br /><br />While this movie was certainly disturbing and I just wanted to cry and cover my eyes during a lot of the movie	 this was actually pretty creative. Back in the day when we had hand drawn animation that made films more personal and that the writers and animators put their heart into it	 you can tell that they did that with Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure. This certainly wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen	 I just don't know who to recommend it too. As scared as I was	 I have to admit I'm glad I watched it	 sometimes you need a ""WTF?!"" movie to spice up your selection	 believe me when I say that Raggedy Ann had no problem in doing just that with me. It's official	 that doll is just plain creepy	 let's just put it this way	 there's a giant caramel river that is eating everything	 a king who's head keeps getting bigger as he laughs	 a bizarre thing that humiliates Raggedy Ann and her brother	 a strange almost incest between Ann and Andy and a couple of naked dolls that will forever haunt my dreams with their songs.

"I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on a movie like this. I couldn't believe the other reviews and I thought it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least once...but trust me	 it is.<br /><br />I haven't seen the old movie..but why would they want to remake a movie like this. The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. This film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb.I just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point 	 but it never does. <br /><br />So this movie is a big no no for both Horror movie fans as well as for the Cage fans. You could probably for it show up on television."	0.0
"This show probably won't appeal to everyone. Sarah does what she wants; she doesn't ask for permission and she doesn't apologize. This is a sitcom with zombies	 robot dinosaurs	 flying cars	 and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders. The star of the show is not a hero	 she is a spoiled	 bigoted pervert. If you can't appreciate the offbeat humor it offers	 the show probably isn't for you. Everyone should at least give this show a chance. It brings together the comedic styling of Sarah Silverman	 Brian Posehn (The Comedians of Comedy)	 Jay Johnston (Mr. Show)	 Steve Agee (Bobcat Goldthwait's 'Stay') and the creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack	 Monster House).

"Animation always seems to be fringe. In Japan	 this might not be the case	 but in Europe and much more so in the USA animation has a big fat ""KIDS"" tag on it. France is probably one of the more comic-liberal countries	 home of classics as Tin-Tin	 Asterix	 Lucky Luke	 Valereon and so on(if you've never read these	 it's not too late. There's no upper-age limit on them and they don't carry the nerd-stigma of DC or Marvel) It seems natural a movie like this one pops up in France. It suits my prejudiced image of the French as art-loving	 anti-USA-oriented and talented movie-makers. Luckily there's also ""A scanner darkly"" out there to suppress that view - seems art is pretty much international.<br /><br />Anyway	 as you might have gathered Renaissance is artsy and French. If you're a normal person you will get scared by this. There's no need for that however! Beneath it's cool	 sleek cel-shaded appearance there's a good thriller and a good movie overall.<br /><br />That was one of my fears for this movie. It's so easy turning the spectacular animation to a gimmick	 much like Sony & C:o are doing with their Pixar rip-offs. I was expecting a confusing	 sometimes boring and not very engaging movie	 but luckily I was wrong.<br /><br />I would have enjoyed it anyway for the neo-noir stuff	 but it was good that it was worthwhile on that level as well. NOTE: I've seen the French dub which was OK as far as I could see. English might be more interesting what with Craig and everything.<br /><br />A final word of praise to the animation. It was awesome. Futuristic	 well-crafted	 nice camera-work	 smart solutions(Eyes for example looked very good	 which is hard to do) and so visually stunning I felt like bursting out ""This is so damn impressive!"". Then again	 I really like animation and I appreciate the effort the studio put down	 so my verdict is a bit biased.<br /><br />Good movie anyway	 definitely lives beyond it's ""gimmick""."	1.0
"I just watched the documentary ""Fog City Mavericks"" on the Starz cable TV network. It is without a doubt	 one of my most enjoyable viewing experiences ever! It chronicles the San Francisco Bay area artists and creative talent responsible for the some of the best films ever made. In addition to the well-known artists listed	 t also includes segments with Irvin Kershner	 Caleb Deschanel and a segment about Pixar Animation Studios. I hope it will be released on DVD-this is a must for any collection about cinema history and brilliant film-making. If you are even remotely interested in movies and the people who create them	 you will not be disappointed."	1.0
"Before I begin	 let me tell you how GREAT this stand-up special sounds when you play Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut at the same time (Red Mountain level in particular). So while watching this stand-up special	 I suggest-- no	 DEMAND you do it.<br /><br />Carlos Mencia takes his stand-up to the extreme in San Francisco	 California. There	 he makes fun of everybody with absolutely NO apologies.<br /><br />I am pretty much thanking God here that Carlos didn't do his thing in which he uses the same joke over and over and over and over and over again. He does a tremendous job making fun of everyone and at the same time be truthful about it; I know a couple of times I said	 after Carlos said a joke	 ""Damn	 this guy makes a good point!"" And then the Game Over screen came over my TV because I forgot I was playing Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut. My bad :) So yeah	 there's nothing to complain about this stand-up special. If you have TiVo or something like that	 please do yourself a favor and record this historic hour."	1.0
"This little seen movie is a languid and laid-back giallo. It veers away from some of the cliché's of the genre and adopts a looser approach. It's about a woman searching for her missing lover; a psychiatrist who has suddenly vanished for no apparent reason. Her search leads her to a villa populated by a group of eccentric individuals. In true giallo style	 murder is never far away.<br /><br />The cast is really rather good. We have Aldofo Celi (Thunderball)	 Alida Valli (Suspiria)	 Horst Frank (Cat o' Nine Tails) and a very young Sybil Danning (80's scream queen). The lead actress is Rosemary Dexter	 and while I am not familiar with her	 she does a good job in leading the picture.<br /><br />One of the defining features of Eye in the Labyrinth is its music. Atypically for a giallo it features a jazz-rock fusion soundtrack. This score	 composed by Roberto Nicolosi	 is reminiscent of Miles Davis	 especially his work on In A Silent Way. It's an excellent soundtrack and really gives this movie a different feel than most gialli. The fusion groove accentuates the languid atmosphere and compliments the sunny	 sea-front scenery that the film is mostly made up of.<br /><br />This is a giallo so we really need to talk about the murder set-pieces. Well	 this film falls a little short in this regard. It's certainly not devoid of them but they are few and far between. The opening dream-murder being probably the best on offer as well as a memorable burning car sequence. But this really isn't a particularly violent film. Still	 I don't think it should disappoint too many seasoned fans of the genre. The mystery is fairly compelling and it has enough eccentric characters (the idiot boy Saro and THAT unsettlingly inappropriate dubbed accent?) and moments of the bizarre to satisfy; while the sleaze-factor is upheld with a smattering of nudity throughout.<br /><br />Eye in the Labyrinth plays like a giallo version of an Agatha Christie mystery	 as it features a group of unsympathetic characters in a villa	 all under suspicion of murder; we have the obligatory flashbacks detailing their connections with the final hours of the (highly unsympathetic) murder victim. While this isn't a grade-A example of the genre	 it's certainly an appealingly different one	 as it doesn't borrow too heavily from other films of the sub-genre. For giallo enthusiasts I give this a thumbs up and hope one day it's given a nice DVD transfer. It certainly deserves the treatment."	1.0
"Every new fall line-up show deserves	 at least	 my ""3 strikes and you're out"" policy. I give a comedy 3 chances to make me laugh	 that is	 3 complete episodes. After Episode 1	 I actually said to the TV	""Cancelled tomorrow"". It was that bad. I have now watched the first 4 episodes of ""Cavemen"" and have yet to manage even a smirk. Not a titter	 a guffaw	 a chortle	 as a matter of fact	 no facial movement at all. I will continue to punish myself by watching every future episode because I am convinced that I am clearly missing something in this show. I'm simply not ""getting"" it	 but I believe that a comedy on a major TV network in prime-time	 just HAS to be funny; but there are no laughs from me YET. There's just no way that ABC would put on the least funniest comedy of all time at 8:00 p.m. I KNOW there has got to be an inside joke that just isn't jiving with my brain. I've read each of the previous comments	 I ""get"" the social aspect of it	 but	 WHERE ARE THE JOKES ???? I shall continue suffering for at least 30 minutes a week	 until I have a light-bulb moment and smack myself in the head shouting ""Eureka""."	0.0

"It is incredible in that it succeeds in being terrible on so many levels. The script	 the acting	 the directing and the choice of cast are all appalling. The costumes	 sets and pseudo-medieval language are also utterly awful. In an odd way I actually enjoyed this film	 once I had accepted that it wasn't going to be any good. It seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so poor	 when really they could have made something pretty decent out of the premise (albeit not very believable!)	 but instead we are treated to a rather nauseating and cheesy tale of dragons and knights	 that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films. Let's just hope that The Lord of the Rings is a bit better! Oh	 and David Thewlis' haircut makes him look like He-Man. It does!"	0.0

"Fashionably fragmented	 yet infuriatingly half-realized character-study	 an examination of the different personalities of two college roommates: a talented but undisciplined star basketball player	 and a pot-smoking	 womanizing rabble-rouser. We never learn why these young men are friends. They may share confusions about the world and their places in it	 but they don't seem to have anything else in common. Making his directorial debut	 Jack Nicholson--who also co-wrote the screenplay with Jeremy Larner	 based upon Larner's book--doesn't introduce us to the characters with any clarity	 nor he does shape the scenes to help us identify with anyone on the screen. There are some very decent performances here (particularly from newcomer William Tepper in the central role)	 but most of the picture is unformed (perhaps intentionally)	 sketchy or unsure. Bruce Dern plays the hard-driving basketball coach	 Karen Black is the older	 married lady Tepper is having an affair with	 and Michael Margotta is Tepper's wayward friend (in an off-putting	 over-the-top performance). Nicholson fails to set up the sequences with any particular flavor	 preferring (I assume) to let the character interaction dominate the film's tone; his script is no help either	 and as a result it is unclear whom we're supposed to sympathize with. Small	 random moments do work (a supermarket fight between Tepper and Black	 Dern visiting Tepper in his dorm-room	 all of the scenes set on the court)	 however the entire third act of the picture is an excruciating mess. Hoping to juxtapose an all-important b-ball game with a sexual assault	 Nicholson shows no style at his craft (nor does he earn points for chutzpah	 as his staging of these events is squashy and ugly). When a director goes out of his way to humiliate his actors	 one has to question his motives in doing so. Perhaps if ""Drive	 He Said"" ultimately made some sort of powerful statement in the bargain	 audiences could forgive the filmmaker for his lapses in judgment and taste. Unfortunately	 the perplexing closer is as dumbfounding as much of the rest of the movie. *1/2 from ****"	0.0
"I can't think of much to say about this film. <br /><br />This was an awful movie...I can't even tell you what made me decide to view it. It had SO few redeeming qualities that I don't even know where to begin.<br /><br />The plot moved from implausible to downright absurd. My entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because I could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done. By the end of the movie	 I found myself feeling beyond relieved. <br /><br />The editing was poor	 the acting was sub-par	 and the storyline was weak. Francoise Robinson was cast as a Native American	 even though she does not even closely resemble someone of Native American heritage. <br /><br />If a movie is going to be this idiotic	 it should be laughably stupid -- at the very least. It wasn't. It was just pathetic."	0.0

I also liked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell)<br /><br />The house was very Gothic and beautiful in a spooky way. The special and sound effects were awesome.

"I had never seen a silent movie until July 24	 2005. I had never seen a movie with Mary Pickford in it. I've seen thousands of movies. Very few are hypnotic to me. I found Last of the Mohicans and Unforgettable (Ray Liotta) to be hypnotic	 so consider the source as you read this. I started watching Tess of the Storm Country on TCM just to see who this Mary Pickford was	 who has been credited by many for launching Hollywood. I had no idea what I was in for. Two hours later	 I snapped out of it	 and realized I'd watched one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen	 playing a role perfectly suited to her. Imagine a movie fan in 1922	 having never seen anyone that gorgeous and that expressive before. You would have to see her again and again. The setting was perfect for a girl that expressive. She was a poor squatter	 couldn't speak the King's English	 but you had to admire her. What a movie... time to start my Mary Pickford movie collection!"	1.0
don't see this. this was one of the dumbest movies i have ever seen. its hard to be Mormon sometimes when there are movies like this out there. what a sad view of Mormon life. i can tell you if you did see this movie that it is not all like this at all in a singles ward. if it was i don't think i would have made it through it. its too bad that most Mormon movies are made by a group of geeks who have nothing better to do. the acting was so bad that my wife and i barely made it through. i guess you could say that it had all the signs of a B movie. or are there C movies? anyway...i just thought this movie sucked and was full of cheese. i wish some Mormons would start making some quality movies.	0.0
"Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews	 who were both so memorable in 1944's ""Laura	 re-teamed for this excellent 1950 film-noir.<br /><br />An embittered policeman	 Andrews as Mark	 can't get over the fact that his father was a hoodlum who died in a police shootout while trying to break out of jail.

"A meteor drops from the sky and reawakens a plesiosaur that long ago used to terrorize the area around Crater Lake . As the monster eats the locals they try and find away of killing the monster.<br /><br />Recent attempts at sending up old horror and science fiction films like Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Alien Trespass are kind of rendered moot when you have films like Crater Lake Monster available for screening. It's the sort of film that those films spoof and send up only this is the real deal. Its everything those films try to be only with out the tongue in cheek and its so much more fun because of it. This is a real drive-in sort of film that had the unfortunate luck of coming just as Star Wars changed the way we look at special effects. The monster	 a mix of stop motion and a life size head	 is a charmingly quaint little beast. The filmmakers spoil the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its mayhem. Sure its clear that its all fake	 but isn't movies about suspension of disbelief? Actually I think its about really cool monsters	 which this has.<br /><br />I like this movie in a low budget drive in sort of a way. If you want a real authentic drive in monster movie look no farther. This would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar lake monster films (Boggy Creek etc.)"	1.0
"This is a great British film. A cleverly observed script with many quotable lines	 which captures perfectly what magic mushrooms can do to a man over a weekend. As per usual Phil Daniels is excellent along with that most under rated of British actors Geoff Bell. Peter Bowles with a joint hanging out of his mouth is a casting masterstroke and Gary Stretch with his brooding looks brings something strangely atmospheric to the piece. Although it seems to be billed as a biker movie	 i think it will find an audience outside of this	 purely on the premise that a lot of people have been there done it and got the t-shirt. also A great original soundtrack with a blinding version of Freebird. This really could be a 21st century heir to the famous Ealing comedies. Like the weed in the Welsh fields: it's a grower!"	1.0

"I just finished reading a book on Anita Loos' work and the photo in TCM Magazine of MacDonald in her angel costume looked great (impressive wings)	 so I thought I'd watch this movie. I'd never heard of the film before	 so I had no preconceived notions about it whatsoever. Thought it got off to a cute start with Eddy as the playboy and MacDonald as the secretary he doesn't know exists. The scene where she shows up at the costume party in her simple angel outfit with an uncooperative halo and wings that won't stay on was really endearing. I was even with the film when Eddy goes to sleep and imagines her as a real angel. But after a while it just started to fall apart for me. Eddy stays ""asleep"" for the entire rest of movie	 so it's all a dream. Whatever happens from there on doesn't really matter	 because he's just dreaming. The rest of it was pretty much plot less and pointless. I had to force myself to stick with it. And the final number where MacDonald goes from musical number to musical number in some mad hallucination was just plain freaky.<br /><br />Had Eddy ""woken"" a sooner and the original story continued	 or had he really married an angel	 I think it would have been a lot more interesting. I wanted to see more of her real character.<br /><br />There weren't really enough musical numbers to call it a musical. The first few songs were good	 but the jitterbug number that MacDonald performs was like nails on a chalkboard. Completely wrong for her operatic voice. Even so	 Eddy and MacDonald still manage to shine	 showing what true stars they were."	0.0
"The most satisfying element about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic. The casting of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a superb decision; she is exceptionally talented	 intelligent	 naturally attractive and	 thank goodness	 appropriately aged for the part! Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson	 it would have been a disaster.<br /><br />Another wonderful aspect about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the ""frat pack"" formula: dumb chicks	 chauvinistic guys	 and sleazy jokes. ""Dan in Real Life"" is witty and has fun	 intelligent laughs throughout. Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing	 the jokes from ""Dan in Real Life"" are more natural and clever	 and involve some thinking on the part of the audience.<br /><br />My only problem with ""Dan in Real Life"" is that the rebellious	 middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress Brittany Robertson. It's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director. Either way	 her character is unrealistic and annoying. But	 this is only a minor flaw in the film	 and does not take away from the story as a whole.<br /><br />All in all	 ""Dan in Real Life"" is a great film	 a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies. The quality of the writing	 directing	 acting	 and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It is simply a beautiful	 light-hearted comedy."	1.0

The last time i saw it- was with my friend	 who is a Christian Arab	 and it was on the independence day of Israel ( the most symbolic i could ! how ironic) and... he cried in the end!!! - if he's been touched and wasn't embarrassed- everyone would be touched by The Bubble!"	1.0
"I do regret that I have bought this series. I expected more action	 more objective picture and more consistency. This is just a pure propaganda series	 very dark	 without any charm	 or romanticism	 it is just boredom itself. I find the actors work quite weak as well. O'Donnell might seem charming as Robin (with Batman)	 but in this picture he lacks any charm. Probably while he becomes older	 he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up. It comes as no surprise	 that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the UK for 40% of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands."	0.0
"I went into a Video Store and looked around to find some Horror Movies	 after about 30 minutes I just rushed and picked out a few. I stumbled upon ""Masters of Horror"" which contained ""Pro-Life"" and ""Right to Die"". They seemed OK	 same-old cheesy Horror crap	 but I was interested for some reason. It said about Pro-Life on the case about being a classic	 a return to form for John Carpenter (I loved his ""The Thing""	 so I thought this would be good) and all that. So I turned it on thinking it would be something great and interesting	 I was very wrong... It started off casual	 just a girl running through a Forest	 scared of something. A car stops and picks her up (just so being the people she needed to see	 amazing?) They take her back to some Clinic and examine her	 at the sametime all this is happening her Father appears at the gates and they don't allow him in	 he isn't aloud near the area. Most likely from something he would of done in the past	 but you don't know of any of this at the moment. He really does not want his Daughter in this place	 an Abortion center. He is very strongly against such acts	 believing it's sickening and not what ""God"" would want. He ""supports"" what I heard is called ""Pro-Life"". Acting against Abortions and going to extremes to allow the Babies to be born	 they are sick. They don't like the Life of an unborn being taken	 yet they've killed Humans in the past to allow the Birth? Justice is only a figment of the mind. Anyway	 back on track	 after the girl is examined they find out shes pregnant	 but far ahead than what she should be. She is only a few weeks pregnant	 but is months ahead. She keeps telling them they wont understand her	 and that she wants an Abortion and all	 but finally tells the truth that she was raped by a Demon from Hell	 and that her Father wants this baby (but believes ""God"" wants this baby	 not who truly does). He gets his 3 Sons (they arm themselves with Pistols and Shotguns)	 and begin to make they're way into the Clinic (shooting down anyone who won't co-operate). The head of the Clinic	 who must of had trouble with them in the past	 is well prepared this time. Ends up killing one the Fathers Sons	 but in the end gets shot a few times (wearing a bullet proof jacket). The Father then performs what he believes is done to the Women. He cuts a hole	 where the Vagina would be if he we're a Female	 and sticks some sort of sucking thing up there and sucks out all this blood. Whilst all this is happening	 the girl gives birth to some Demonic baby with many legs	 and some Demon raises from beneath the Earth (not in the same room) and starts looking for its child. The Father sees this later on	 and starts questioning why this happened	 he did what he was told to do	 and doesn't understand why it's like this. The Demon had killed both of his Sons earlier	 and now goes for Father... Whilst the girl kills the baby	 and the Demon carries it away (not in the same scene).<br /><br />Yeah	 it probably sounds pretty cool	 and a thrilling Horror Movie	 but it isn't. The acting is horrible and lacks enthusiasm	 the script is boring and not even creative	 they choose the wrong characters and don't even build on them; just everything put together	 all the small parts	 don't even add up to something great	 a waste of time. I wouldn't classify this as a Horror	 though it has elements of Horror	 they ultimately fail at what they try to succeed. It felt more like a ""Beginners"" Short-Movie	 than by John Carpenter.<br /><br />Sorry for my lack of information	 and detailed review	 I just didn't have the time to waste to write something exciting. Also sorry if my spelling and details are incorrect	 I couldn't really be bothered to research anything."	0.0
"I loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end. I found the director/ actor's style of directly addressing me/the audience very engaging.<br /><br />What I found most exciting and refreshing about this movie was its ignoring -- and thus challenging -- of gender and class stereotypes. The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strengths	 and the absence of judgment -- and the characters' acceptance of themselves and each other -- enabled me to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world. Without preaching	 and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor	 this movie has the power to open us to new possibilities	 and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals. I look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director."	1.0
"I have to be 100% honest with you fellow IMDb users. I wanted to see this movie for a very long time only because of the poster. Doesn't Charlotte Gainsbourg looks extremely sexy and charming smiling that way? I'm in love with that woman! I got what I expected...but only half. This film should deliver expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situations.<br /><br />While I don't agree with another fellow IMDb user who states that the movie is overrated; I must admit that ""Préte-moi ta main"" has plenty of flaws.<br /><br />My main problem with the film is the lack of on screen chemistry between the main characters. There isn't a single scene previous to the climax that shows the main characters sharing a moment ""of romance"" or even a clue to suggest that they're interested in each other.<br /><br />In fact	 the only scene were both share a moment is tremendously awkward (when both are in the couch) and does not help the audience understand about a possible love interest. I didn't buy the dinner sequence.<br /><br />Still	 the movie delivers very funny moments and has a strong dialogs that support such an ingenuous premise. I mean with ingenuous that it would be very difficult to execute such a farse by a 43 year old man in these days.<br /><br />I understand it's a movie and that's why I accept it as a funny situation. Plus	 the humor is versatile. There are moments involving S&M	 funny lines with Chabat's best friend	 some lesbian references	 funny situations involving the family women	 and more.<br /><br />Charlotte Gaionsbourg's performance is top notch and she's by far the reason to watch the movie. She's funny	 sexy	 looks very thin and fine	 and demonstrates she's a versatile and talented actress who can pull out a comedic and dramatic performance in sheer brilliance.<br /><br />Alain Chabat is a fine actor and gives a very decent performance. I think the supporting cast do what they can.<br /><br />The score	 art direction	 and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look to the film.<br /><br />Those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be pleased after the ending credits.

"Losing Control is another offering in the erotic thriller genre which could be considered as the pulp fiction of the film world. Usually	 they involve a roundabout route to murderous intent	 interspersed with copious disrobing. This is not a complaint	 especially when it is done by the stunningly beautiful women who invariably inhabit this make-believe world.<br /><br />Kim Ward (Kira Reed) is suffering a bout of writer's block. Just by chance	 (or is it?) she meets a man (Doug Jeffery) who engages with her in ever more risky sexual encounters. The man refuses to divulge any information about himself	 yet Kim steadfastly refuses to stop the affair. Her agent	 Alexa (Anneliza Scott) thinks it will do wonders for her book sales. As in most films of this type	 the denouement comes near the end but some things do not add up. I have seen enough of this kind of film to think	 no change there	 then - but I like them. They are so undemanding.<br /><br />Performances of the cast vary. Doug Jeffery carries the film as the psycho/sociopath you do not want to cross. Kira Reed looks good but fails to convince as the woman in peril. Clay Greenbush as the PI did not convince either.<br /><br />Finally	 a note of caution about the DVD under review. Both the cover and the disc state R-rated and running time as 93 minutes but the run time is less than 86 minutes. This probably explains why the sex scenes appear truncated and why Jennifer Ludlow's performance is cut short just as she's getting started. 4 stars."	0.0
"In a way	 Corridors of Time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal : being seen by thousands. But it fails at making them laugh...<br /><br />Les Visiteurs has had its success	 because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel : forget about Zemeckis's Back to the future	 here comes the old France	 the middle-age knight and its nearly barbaric way of life. Full of pride	 funny thanks to the ancient words he uses	 Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor.

And it's no use being a movie expert to realize that the Corridors of Time has been made for money.<br /><br />The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs	 and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time paradox that would have needed some second tought. Explanation : it's no use trying to get back the jewelry Jacquouille has stolen ; don't you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode ? Where do you think he found the money ? Selling the jewelry... And that's only one of many holes Poiré tries to avoid... and fails.<br /><br />Let's have a look at the characters : Montmirail doesn't change	 he's just a little more boring. Regarding Frenegonde... that's another story : Valérie Lemercier decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeoise role. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I found so pitiful I nearly felt pain for her. And Poiré doesn't realize that a cast of humorists isn't enough to make a good comedy.<br /><br />Forget about the time travels	 about the digital effects	 concentrate on the story and you'll see that there's enough room on a mail stamp to write it 10 times.<br /><br />The main interest of this film is the landscapes. A movie for youngsters	 let's say up to 13 years old."	0.0
"Nicely and intelligently played by the two young girls	 Mischa Barton as Frankie	 and Ingrid Uribe as Hazel	 although the plot is rather a stretch of the imagination. Young Hazel running for mayor seems out of place	 to be honest.<br /><br />While the acting is well done by all concerned the movie tends to lack a genuine atmosphere of drama. Perhaps we've grown to expect gritty reality in movies	 rather like comparing Pollyanna to How Green Was My Valley! Never mind	 each of them are good in their own way.<br /><br />I do admire Joan Plowright even if her role is somewhat subdued here. Middle of the road entertainment well suited for younger viewers	 and how nice at times to be exposed to fine classical music which is almost a rarity!<br /><br />I find this movie to be a welcomed change as it reflects quieter	 thoughtful values for the growing up years	 and no violence thank goodness. A warm family film to enjoy."	1.0
"Jason Lee does his best to bring fun to a silly situation	 but the movie just fails to make a connect. <br /><br />Perhaps because Julia Stiles character seems awkward as the conniving and sexy soon to be cousin-in-law. <br /><br />Maybe it is because she and Selma Blair's characters should have been cast the opposite way. (Selma Blair seems more conniving than Julia would be).<br /><br />Either way this movie is yet another Hollywood trivialization of a possibly real world situation (that being getting caught with your pants out at your bachelor party not stooping your cousin)	 which while having promise fails to deliver.<br /><br />There are some laughs to be sure and the cast (even if miscast) do their best with sub grade material which doesn't transcend its raunchy topic. So instead of getting a successful raunch fest (ie Animal House or American Pie) we are left with a middle ground of part humor and part stupidity (ala Meatballs 2 or something)."	0.0
"Nicole Eggert was listed as the star of this	 despite Micheal Dorn & Stacey Keach being much bigger stars than her.<br /><br />Basically this is a bit of a spin on the ""Alien lands on Earth"" film. Eggert plays the girl who feels sorry for an Alien being chased by the military and takes in the runaway creature in her very sexy disguise. A bit of nudity and partial nudity	 a pointless sex scene all feature along the way.<br /><br />The film stumbles through a few obvious set-pieces and running jokes about being shown photographs. I quite liked the Star Trek jokes when Micheal Dorn had been taken over and he got a really cool death scene.<br /><br />It was fairly obvious that Stacey Keach was going to be taken over and the film had quite a weak ending	 it would have been nice to show exactly what kind of talent the Alien passed to Eggert."	0.0
"The premise is simple. This movies starts out looking like your average lame chick flick about two attractive young people meeting each other in an airport	 then things take a 180 degree turn...<br /><br />I for one	 really dislike the kind of mind numbing love story nonsense that pollutes the average movie theater. And it is my humble opinion that Wes Craven	 based on his previous meta-horror films (Sceam) does too...<br /><br />Following this logic	 it's not surprising to find that Craven sardonically takes his time to built up a nauseatingly sweet 'sependipity love'-story	 only to have an AWESOME Cillian Murphy wreck that whole sugar-coated dreamworld... <br /><br />The scope of his character Jackson Ripner (Jack the Ripper	 get it? lame	 right?) in this film is impressive	 he goes from being utterly charming to being a twisted nihilistic sicko	 which is a plus in my book. As he proceeds to freak out his victim (Jennifer Garner lookalike Rachel McAdams	 who I found pretty annoying by the way)	 you can't help but sympathize with the guy...<br /><br />This is Wes Craven	 embodied in Jackson Ripner	 through Cillian Murphy	 bashing all brainless chick flicks...<br /><br />Mr. Craven	 I salute you.<br /><br />Best quote:<br /><br />Jackson Ripner (after beating the snot out of Rachel McAdams in the airplane toilet): ""Thanks for the quickie!!!"""	1.0
"I never really knew who Robert Wuhl was before seeing this. But after seeing it I realized what a funny man he is. This HBO special features him teaching ""American history"" to New York university film students and the man was just phenomenal. He poked fun at almost every key historic event that occurred not just in the U.S. but some other parts of the world. This documentary/comedy was a great satire that made me question if what I accept as the infallible true history is really true.<br /><br />I enjoyed how Mr. Wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedy and made learning a lot more exciting. I would recommend this to anyone interested in history and is willing to question what his/her beliefs."	1.0
"I figured the whole joke of the movie would be to see some rich white guy acting like Chris Rock	 and then see Chris Rock react to people's reactions.

"Since their nasty divorce from the Disney Company (with Disney keeping the Miramax brand) the Weinstein Company seems to specialize in above average movies which are then under-promoted and seen by few. THE FLOCK is a prime example.<br /><br />A story about the civil servants who have the nasty job of keeping track of registered sex offenders	 this picture will tell you more about sex criminals than an entire season of Law and Order - SVU.<br /><br />Richard Gere gives his best-ever performance as the soft-spoken agent worn-out by the task. Claire Danes for once has the opportunity to get into a solid role (instead of the junk she normally gets stuck in) and she makes the most of playing the novice. The cinematography	 pacing	 editing	 all of it is first rate --- and I saw no trace of the attention-deficit-disorder camera jump-around or excess camera cuts that others complained about. The subject is handled with restraint	 but it's still a tough subject and might make you sick.<br /><br />Fifty years ago there was almost no problem with the kinds of sex crimes herein shown in abundance which will shock even the jaded. Then came the Supreme Court decisions which simultaneously tied police hands as the ""rights"" of sex perverts were opened up and America was turned into a shopper's paradise for sexual perversity	 both willing and unwilling. Each such step was met with praise by Liberals	 who celebrated the Warren Court's ill deeds with glossy covers on Time and Newsweek. Everyday liberals also praised the Court's action and mocked those who disagree. In 2007 how many Americans know that the kind of pornography that depicts savage violence and torture of young women -- can be subscribed to	 and delivery of it is subsidized by the discount periodicals rate by the US Post Office. Just one part of the problem -- a problem that can tare anyone's family to shreds.<br /><br />Richard Gere is a Liberal	 but he gives his best in his performance here. Perhaps in his maturing age he's gained a measure of wisdom."	1.0
"This is simply the worst movie I've ever seen. Neither of the three central characters has any charm	 and Erika's good looks aren't enough to carry the film. The lamest plot I've ever had inflicted upon me. Also the most unconvincing military comedy ever. Why did they bother?"	0.0
"Indeed: drug use	 warehouse shoot-'em-ups	 'Matrix'-esque bullet dodging	 a futuristic city with a mix of Asian races	 and a lonely vampire --all in the same movie-- seems like a story that could only be envisioned by a Japanese pop/rock star. And that is exactly what 'Moon Child' is	 and more. While all these elements combined may sound like the perfect subject for a campy B-movie of the week	 'Moon Child' pulls it off with but a few expected bumps and hitches along the way.<br /><br />The film has a gritty	 definitely independent feel to it	 jumping from one scene to the next not in smooth transition	 but rather sporadic leaps and bounds	 giving glimpses into the characters' lives and barely scraping at a true plot. But the film makes no excuses	 instead turning the story into one of friendship	 love	 trust	 and betrayal all sugar-coated in the aforementioned elements of a futuristic society	 warring gangsters	 and vampires.<br /><br />HYDE as the somber vampire 'Kei' is excellent	 giving depth to the character and balancing-out the overly-zealous acting of Gackt as 'Sho	' an orphan who befriends Kei. Lee-Hom Wang also shines as the vengeful 'Son' who becomes friends with a grown-up Sho. The story revolves around these characters and their extended friends and family through different periods in their lives	 and how simple friendship can so easily be turned into grief and betrayal.<br /><br />While the action at times is all-too unrealistic and special effects appear just to show-off	 one thing the film never does is presume to be about the immensely popular Asian singers it features. The superstars as actors have their flaws	 and so do their characters. The movie rarely gets boring	 and ends where it should	 after jumping about quite a bit. 'Moon Child' is rather enjoyable	 humorous at times	 and even very touching: it is definitely worth your time!"	1.0

"""Moonstruck"" is a lovely little film directed by superb story teller	 Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night	 Fiddler on the Roof	 The Hurricane). The film is great on many levels. It shows a good slice of Italian culture	 has a touching romance	 and (best of all) is a hilarious comedy.<br /><br />One thing I liked most about the film was the relative unconventional looks of the actors.

"Darius Goes West is a film depicting American belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough. This wonderful fun filled and sometimes heartbreaking film shows a young man who never expected	 but longed to see	 what was outside the confines of his lovely city of Athens	 GA. Darius wished to see the ocean. His longtime friends Logan	 Ben and several other good friends decided to make Darius' wish come true. They started small - Ben & Logan's mom started an email campaign to bring awareness to Darius' condition: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and to raise funds for the fellas to take Darius to not only see the ocean but to see these great United States. To say the young college buddies succeeded in bringing hope and awareness to this dreaded disease would be an understatement. They realized Darius' dream and then some. They put their lives on hold while showing love	 care and tons of fun to Darius while helping Darius see how he can in turn show those same traits to others suffering from DMD. Darius went on to volunteer for the Red Cross - sitting in his chair collecting money (along with his buddies) outside a local grocery store. His wonderful smile tells the world that dreams do come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends to support and care for you. Give Darius and all the guys an Oscar - no one else deserves it more. Martha Sweeney."	1.0
"Dull haunted house thriller finds an American family moving into a 200 year old house in Japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred. <br /><br />Novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of Motel Hell. The film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall. <br /><br />One obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned. The monk recounts the history of the house (which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence) and then the film simply cuts away to something else. Earlier the monk had offered to help. Well	 where is the help? The family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is made until nearly the very end when he turns up again to do what he should have done an hour earlier--try to drive the spirits out of the house	 although by this time it's difficult for the viewers to care.<br /><br />There are some (probably) unintentional campy laughs in seeing the American actors at the end become possessed by the Japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts	 I say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel from the same director's Motel Hell which was more obviously meant to be amusing	 but on the whole this is a forgettable dud."	0.0
"Shiner	 directed by Christian Calson	 centers around three ""couples"" and their relationships with obsession and violence. Pretty good start as far as I'm concerned. Interesting. The couples break down into a heterosexual couple	 two heterosexual male friends and a straight guy being ""harmlessly"" stalked by a gay man.<br /><br />The ""het"" couple really don't have much of a role in the film. There are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive when having sex or playing around with each other	 but seem to have no real purpose since the are so marginalized. My assumption is that they represent a more day to day illustration of how sex/violence are integrated in a couples life. The couple aren't very aggressive and it's not even shot in any kind of erotic way. As characters	 they don't add much to the theme or plot.<br /><br />The two male friends make up the bulk of the plot. They engage in some gay bashing of sorts by convincing a homosexual man to have sex with them in an alley. This escalates into violence. And the violence changes them. It becomes a means of sexual gratification. And their need for violence t release grows as the film progresses. The main problem I had is the violence is not convincing. Never once does it seem that any of the characters is in any real danger. It just doesn't work. Given that the whole theme of the film is about the characters' relationships with violence	 this is a major problem. Unfortunately	 the make-up doesn't help either. Sometimes	 it's okay	 other times it is very bad. In one scene	 I really wondered why one of the characters had rouge smeared on his face. Confusing.<br /><br />The more interesting pair of the characters is the ""stalker couple."" Here Calson seemed to have more to say and was able to develop a more coherent storyline. Perhaps it is because the characters seem to develop more and have resolution at the end. Shiner may well have been much better if it had stuck with these two.<br /><br />I appreciate that Calson wanted to achieve a lot with this film. It is admirable. Most low budget flicks don't aspire to much. I don't think Calson achieved want he was aiming for. Myself	 I found nothing particularly controversial or unsettling. Shiner was unconvincing. This doesn't mean	 however	 that the director can't achieve something with his next film.<br /><br />He seems to have something to say."	0.0
"This film was so predictable	 that during the entire time you're hoping that the obvious suspect is innocent	 and there's some other big twist still coming. However... it doesn't. He just continues to act creepy	 and she continues to ignore it. Mary found very incriminating evidence at his place	 and she still trusted him? And what was that ""baiting the trap""? There was no trap. She confronted him	 he said ""excuse me. I have to go kill someone"" He left	 and that was the end of it. They make attempts to use other suspects	 (like that one older carnival girl at the end) but they're completely underdeveloped. Actually	 all the characters are underdeveloped. They have no depth	 and the setting is just plain strange... who hangs out in a recycling factory?? Its choppy and nothing is well developed. For example: When she leaves his place after having the beer	 and he finds the pics and she runs out and he catches her and they end up having sex in that car... what was that? Her reactions weren't portrayed. In the car she acted scared like it could have been practically rape- but then all we see is her showering the next morning. booooooooo It could have been so much better.. sooo much better."	0.0
"This is the movie that epitomizes the D&D fear of the 80s (and even today). The fear being that people who play D&D (or any other role-playing game for that matter) will be ""sucked in"" and lose their ability to distinguish reality from fantasy (and go on killing sprees	 child sacrifices	 suicide	 etc). Great movie for anyone who likes to blame the problems of society on inanimate objects	 but anyone who has played a role-playing game	 a video game	 or even acted in a play will see this as an insult to their intelligence. It is to D&D what Wargames was to computers. Plus as a movie	 it just kinda sucks."	0.0
"Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. This is the movie which caused his downfall. It was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred. Soon after its release	 he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably. Its a very bad movie with horrible acting	 bad-quality makeup and pathetic screenplay. Throughout the movie	 Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease. I'm one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba	 first day first show in theatre. The audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission. Sorry	 I'll not recommend this one to anyone."	0.0
"I'm a huge Jane Austen fan and besides being a feature-length film (a true fan wants to see as little left out as possible and that can only be achieved in a mini-series) it was really great. Gwyneth Paltrow really captures the slightly clueless but well-intentioned rich girl and Jeremy Northam IS Mr. Knightly with his poise and nobility. I wasn't thrilled with Ewan McGregor even though I like him very much as an actor but didn't feel it spoiled the movie at all. Like I said	 as a Jane Austen fan there were things I would have liked to have seen included that weren't but that would have made it much longer than permissible for a feature length film and as it was I felt they really encapsulated the story well.

"Farrah Fawcett is superb in this powerful 1986 drama	 where she plays Marjorie	 a woman who manages to escape the clutches of a would-be rapist. Well done to Farrah for being a Golden Globe 'Best Actress' nominee.<br /><br />When her rapist Joe (terrifically played by James Russo) comes into her home	 which she shares with her two roommates (who are conveniently out!)	 Marjorie has to play along with Joe's frightening demands. It does make for some disturbing and shocking images!<br /><br />When her roommates come home	 they are astounded (to say the least) by Marjorie's actions	 and a great performance by Alfre Woodard who desperately tries to convince Marjorie to do the right thing and turn him into the police	 makes the film even more nail-biting.<br /><br />I do find Diana Scarwid quite irritating	 but when Joe finally admits that he came there to kill them all	 it makes the film a very emotional piece of drama indeed.<br /><br />Overall	 Extremities is a brilliantly thought-out and well-acted movie and I must have watched it hundreds of time by now! Well done to everybody involved."	1.0

"""One of Hung's better early efforts. The humor is dead-on in parts as Hung tries to imitate Lee's moves and facial expressions	 and also in a bit where Hung pokes fun at Jackie Chan's Drunken Master. The action is also pretty good	 especially when Hung takes on a trio on martial arts experts at the end. It's not the greatest film	 but pretty good for '70's kung fu	 especially if you're a fan of Hung and/or Lee. Be warned	 though: most video versions of the movie have pretty shoddy quality. There is also a character in blackface which some people might find offensive.<br /><br />Sammo Hung is a rural swine-herder who moves to Hong Kong to fight off some bad guys. Sammo turns on his dead-on Bruce Lee impersonation when fighting! <br /><br />This film is often billed as a parody of Bruce Lee's ""Enter The Dragon""	 but it's not exactly that... Sammo is a rural swine herder--obsessed with Bruce Lee--who moves to Hong Kong to help his relatives run a small open-air restaurant. Once situated at the new job	 he is forced to defend the eatery from local gangsters looking for protection money. When Sammo switches into fighting mode	 he switches on his Bruce Lee impersonation	 which must be seen to be believed! This film is pretty sloppy	 in many of the fight scenes Sammo battles against people who are obviously actors rather than martial artists	 and there's one character who's supposed to be black who is played by an Asian man in heavy (and preposterous) makeup. But what this film lacks in budget and accuracy	 it more than makes up for in atmosphere and energy. Highly recommended for a good mood."""	1.0

"THE SECRET OF KELLS is an astonishing first animated feature which will dazzle your eye and move your heart. The shortcomings of the film's limited budget and sometimes limited animation are more than compensated for by the visual poetry of the story of young Brendan's heroic quest to become a master illuminator during the dark ages. Historically this was in the late 8th century	 when the centers of Irish learning were over-run by the Vikings. The Vikings appear here as brute antagonists	 the equivalent on the North Seas of the plundering Huns and Mongols further East. The film's narrative--- which functions more as a parable--- centers around the conflict between Brendan	 who seeks to create beauty in his illuminations during a time of encroaching darkness	 and his stern Uncle the Abbot-- who seeks to protect the town of Kells and his nephew with a looming wall as barrier against the Norsemen. The Abbot disregards the value of Brendan's art in his quest for security. This is the movie's outer conflict. Brendan's inner conflict is to find the hidden eye of creative illumination which will allow him to complete the most difficult painting in the Book of Kells. This eye is guarded by a Dragon Ouroboros	 who destroys from within those not suited to this quest as surely as the Vikings will kill from without (That's as much of the story as I'll divulge!)<br /><br />What I really like about this film is its creators' imaginative understanding of some of the greatest art work to survive in the West from 1200 years ago. The characters are stylized in flat abstract shapes defined by line just as in the original Book of Kells. (Particularly noteworthy is monk Aidan's pet cat	 defined in few lines	 yet purely--- and even magically metamorphically feline.) The range of emotion which Brendan and the other animated characters convey given their economy of abstract design is a tribute to the excellent artistry of the director and his animators. The decorative borders on the edge of the picture change to complement the dramatic impact of a given scene	 and this characteristic of illuminations from the dark ages is brought to wondrous animated life in THE SECRET OF KELLS. Of course	 historical dramas usually tell us more about our own times than the times which these dramas endeavor to depict. However	 by introducing archetypal elements into this story	 the writers and director of THE SECRET OF KELLS convey a numinous sense of lived-life from that far-off time in Ireland which feels psychologically true	 however much the script might stray from pedantic historical fact. (The United Nations' band of illuminators who appear as a rogues' club of artists in The SECRET OF KELLS aren't historically probable	 but they're all well-designed	 individuated characters who do much to convey the universal appeal of this quintessentially Irish story.) Animation has always seemed the best vehicle to me to better help us understand the visual art of different times and cultures. The magnificent art direction of this movie clearly derives from its historical visual source	 but has also been cleverly adapted to the demands of animated storytelling; if animation had existed in the Dark Ages	 the SECRET OF KELLS is what it would look like! Finally	 Brendan's hero's quest in this film is the artist's perennial quest to convey the spirit of beauty	 life and inspiration. (Without being preachy or even particularly Christian	 this movie affirms Jesus' dictum that ""Man does not live by bread alone."" ) In my estimation the most inspired movie about the creative process of visual artists is Andrei Tarkovsky's ANDREI RUBLEV	 a film about the great Russian icon painter of the 15th century. The SECRET OF KELLS expresses much the same sense of mystery and exhilaration about the artist's visual quest and creative process. It's certainly not as profound as ANDREI RUBLEV	 but--- heck--- its a cartoon! (And one which will appeal to young and old alike.) I think this movie will hold up well to repeated viewing: in its own modest life-affirming way	 this stylized SECRET OF KELLS is a classic."	1.0
"A couple of days after writing about how garbage like MAD COWS and THIS FILTHY EARTH receive money while Ange 	 Duncan and Theo are totally ignored I had to sit through yet another British movie * that had me scratching my head as to why it received a single penny . Some people may claim that because DEAD BABIES is based upon a highly regarded novel it has an in built market but both THIS FILTHY EARTH and MAD COWS were also adapted from novels and they were an ordeal to sit through as well <br /><br />I had read the synopsis of the plot where a bunch of high class wasters go to a remote mansion where they're stalked by an internet cult but to be honest this isn't really how the story unravels and anyone expecting Friday THE 13TH meets THE SHINING is going to be bitterly disappointed since 90-95% of the running time is taken up with said characters taking drugs and discussing sex . And what hateful characters they are too . Not one of them is likable in any way and within minutes you'll be getting nostalgic for Stalin 	 Mao and Pol Pot hoping that next time someone embarks on communist democide they'll be successful in creating an egalitarian utopia . Anything that will signal the end of such decadent bourgeois meaningless that the hateful characters in this movie embark upon can only be welcomed <br /><br />Not content with giving us a movie where the plot is meandering and where the audience fail to connect with the characters the director continues to spoil things further by getting all clever and arty . No doubt that is to impress us so we will fall upon our knees and cry "" Oh my god 	 what a wonderful director the way he bamboozles us with his highly artistic technique and only a worthless pleb will fail to appreciate what a god given talent this man is "" . I'm sure the vast majority of people either screamed "" How come my projects got turned down while crap like this didn't ? "" or "" WTF was the last half hour of this piece of crap all about ? "" You might defend the movie by saying the original source novel was unfilmable and this makes the film unwatchable . I will agree that this movie is unwatchable <br /><br />* I know the IMDb classes this as an American movie but the style and faults with DEAD BABIES is uniquely British . Americans might think they've got things tough with Bush but we've got Tony Blair 	 not to mention DEAD BABIES 	 MAD COWS and THIS FILTHY EARTH . No wonder everyone is ashamed to be British in the 21st century"	0.0
"This German documentary	 in English	 is about a Scottish environmental sculptor named Andy Goldsworthy. He makes art from objects he finds in nature. For example	 early in the film we see him taking sections of icicles and ""gluing"" them together with a little moisture into a serpentine shape that seems to repeatedly go through a vertical rock.<br /><br />Of course	 the icicles melt	 but that transience is a part of most of Goldsworthy's work. He goes to a site and gets a feeling for it	 deciding intuitively what to make that day. He talks of having a ""dialog"" with the rocks and other materials that he works with	 attempting to work *with* rather than against them. It might be stones	 or flowers	 or leaves	 or sticks. The sculpture might last for minutes or years	 or might not even last long enough to be completed and photographed. The work seems to be more of a process than a goal.<br /><br />The film	 and the work	 is beautiful	 inspiring	 and thought provoking. It moves pretty slowly	 which is appropriate for the material	 but you should be sure to go when you have had a good night's sleep. But do go if you have the opportunity.<br /><br />Search the web for some other pages about Andy Goldsworthy or to read about his local sculpture at Stanford University. There are also several books available with photographs of his sculptures.<br /><br />My thoughts: Skip reading this part if you want to find what this film means to you completely independently. I recall a couple of ideas that occurred to me while watching the film which I thought I would share for those of you still reading. First	 the transitory nature of much of Andy Goldsworthy's work reminded me of the natural ebb and flow of human life. We're born	 we live	 and eventually we die. That's natural	 and that's also naturally a part of Goldsworthy's art.<br /><br />The other thought was to be awestruck with the way that Goldsworthy has managed to integrate his passion and his work so thoroughly into his life. Most of us have work which is tolerated at best	 a life which we hardly notice living	 and passions which we really mean to spend more time on	 if we even remember what they are. Andy Goldsworthy has managed to create an amalgam of all of these aspects of his life that looks like it works very well	 and is nourishing for him and those around him. Wow.<br /><br />Seen on 8/28/2002."	1.0
"My favorite movie genre is the western	 it's really the only movie genre that is of American origin. And despite Sergio Leone	 no one does them quite like Americans.<br /><br />Right at the top of my list of ten favorites westerns is Winchester 73. It was the first pairing and only black and white film of the partnership of director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. It was also a landmark film in which Stewart opted for a percentage of the profits instead of a straight salary from Universal. Many such deals followed for players	 making them as rich as the moguls who employed them.<br /><br />Anthony Mann up to this point had done mostly B pictures	 noir type stuff with no real budgets. Just before Winchester 73 Mann had done a fine western with Robert Taylor	 Devil's Doorway	 that never gets enough praise. I'm sure James Stewart must have seen it and decided Mann was the person he decided to partner with.<br /><br />In this film Mann also developed a mini stock company the way John Ford was legendary for. Besides Stewart others in the cast like Millard Mitchell	 Steve Brodie	 Dan Duryea	 John McIntire	 Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson would appear in future Mann films.<br /><br />It's a simple plot	 James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killing him. Why I won't say	 but up to this point we had never seen such cold fury out of James Stewart on screen. Anthony Mann reached into Jimmy Stewart's soul and dragged out some demons all of us are afraid we have.<br /><br />The hate is aptly demonstrated in a great moment towards the beginning of the film. After Stewart and sidekick Millard Mitchell are disarmed by Wyatt Earp played by Will Geer because guns aren't carried in Earp's Dodge City. There's a shooting contest for a Winchester rifle in Dodge City and the betting favorite is Dutch Henry Brown	 played with menace by Stephen McNally. Stewart	 Mitchell and Geer go into the saloon and Stewart and McNally spot each other at the same instant and reach to draw for weapons that aren't there. Look at the closeups of Stewart and McNally	 they say more than 10 pages of dialog.<br /><br />Another character Stewart runs into in the film is Waco Johnny Dean played by Dan Duryea who almost steals the film. This may have been Duryea's finest moment on screen. He's a psychopathic outlaw killer who's deadly as a left handed draw even though he sports two six guns. <br /><br />Another person Stewart meets is Shelley Winters who's fiancé is goaded into a showdown by Duryea and killed. Her best scenes are with Duryea who's taken a fancy to her. She plays for time until she can safely get away from him. Guess who she ultimately winds up with?<br /><br />There are some wonderful performances in some small roles	 there ain't a sour note in the cast. John McIntire as a shifty Indian trader	 Jay C. Flippen as the grizzled army sergeant and Rock Hudson got his first real notice as a young Indian chief. Even John Alexander	 best known as 'Theodore Roosevelt' in Arsenic and Old Lace has a brief	 but impressive role as the owner of a trading post where both McNally and Stewart stop at different times.<br /><br />Mann and Stewart did eight films together	 five of them westerns	 and were ready to do a sixth western	 Night Passage when they quarreled and Mann walked off the set. The end of a beautiful partnership that produced some quality films."	1.0
"{Possible spoilers coming up... you've been forewarned.}<br /><br />This is absolutely one of my all time favorite musicals and movie musicals! (The other is Damn Yankees with Gwen Verdon	 Tab Hunter and Ray Walston) As we all know	 sometimes the luster (not to mention the songs) of a show are lost in its transition from stage to screen. This is	 for the most part	 DEFINITELY not the case here.<br /><br />The sets are divine	 bright and colorful	 the characters are bigger than life and you can't help but love them	 and Michael Kidd's choreography is absolutely stunning. (So glad to know they used the original Broadway choreographer)<br /><br />All of the actors ""bounce the ball"" (that is	 have unbeatable chemistry) to perfection in this film. Frank and Marlon are absolutely believable as the proprietor of the oldest established permanent floating crap game in New York	 and the most notorious gambler who bets on even the most minute things-- such as his fever going up to 104 if he doesn't take penicillin. Sweet	 fresh faced Jean Simmons is perfect for the role of Sarah (although it is true	 her singing pipes are not as outstanding as that of Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman)-- the mission doll with a heart of gold and a drive to heal all. And last but certainly not least (on my list anyway) is Miss Vivian Blaine	 reprising her Broadway role as Miss Adelaide-- the Hot Box lead singer and dancer who would like to finally end her 14 year engagement to Nathan with marriage	 and rid herself of the psychosomatic cold he's given her.<br /><br />First off	 kudos to Stubby Kaye and B.S. Pulley as they reprise their Broadway roles as Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet. There were never two more loveable gamblers than these guys.<br /><br />Brando is superb	 as usual	 and though he's not got the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher	 you forget it-- as he has this sense of determination to bring all he can to his role as Sky Masterson. ""Luck Be A Lady"" gives me chills every time I see him perform the number. Especially enjoyable is hearing him say ""Daddy... I got cider in my ear.""<br /><br />Simmons is charming and pleasant in a role well suited to her looks	 voice and the way she carries herself. You long so dearly for her not only to win Sky (or	 toward the end	 believe him)	 but to help people overcome their gambling	 drinking and other sins	 and live a life with God. Her rendition of ""If I Were A Bell"" is splendid	 to say the least!<br /><br />Sinatra is the man. He is so perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit-- and here he sings parts that Sam Levene from the Broadway cast never could (terrific actor	 but the chap was tone deaf... go figure). I really enjoyed the addition of the song ""Adelaide""... wish some guy would sing like that to ME. Frankie's cool	 slick demeanor transcends the boundaries of this movie. But most importantly	 you want him to marry Adelaide.<br /><br />And speaking of Adelaide	 Vivian Blaine is just sheer perfection in this role. From the accent to her belting out ""Adelaide's Lament""	 she's just terrific. And she's also my favorite part of the entire movie. She really makes you feel for Adelaide... especially when she cries right before and then again during ""Sue Me"". I still haven't decided whether I like ""Pet Me Poppa"" better than ""Bushel and a Peck""... maybe I like them equally. Either way	 she does fantastic with those as well as ""Take Back Your Mink."" (I'm sad that they left out ""hollanderize"" from the film...) She's absolutely MARVELOUS	 not to mention hilarious	 and my favorite part of the entire film.<br /><br />One of the best things about this movie is their lingo. It's a mixture of high class and street slang. Never do they use ""It's""	 ""I'll"" or ""That's."" It's always ""It is""	 ""I will"" and ""That is."" Overall	 Guys & Dolls is one of my favorite all time movies and musicals	 and it's one that you should take time to watch every time it comes on. My only complaint? No ""Marry The Man Today."" Now THAT'S a good song."	1.0
"I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this film. I thought it was funny	 sexy	 painful	 and warm. Andie MacDowell's performance was nuanced and vulnerable. For once	 the director of a MacDowell film did not make her beauty another character in the film. The romance between Kate and her young man is lovely to watch and it plays out very well. Her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life. Imelda Stalinson	 who has been a MVP in so many British films	 does a great job in this. There is some tragedy in this but I think the film is saved in the end by the brilliant acting	 clean direction	 and witty writing.The film quality is excellent and the music is good	 too	 though unavailable on sound track."	1.0
"I just read the comments of TomReynolds2004 and feel I have to jump in here. I understand he doesn't like the film	 but his reasons are not evident. My feeling regarding this film is that it is not afraid to travel the darker roads of loneliness	 failure	 disappointment and sorrow. Each of these two people	 as portrayed	 have plenty of reasons to be bitter and angry	 yet find tenderness and comfort in each the other. Only great acting could make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire	 sentimental and sappy. I really became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to them by such strong performances. I have every reason to dislike Jane Fonda for her Vietnam era actions	 but personal feelings apart	 she is fabulous in this role. Robert DeNiro is superb as a man whose intelligence and goodness begins to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities. This is the first I have seen DeNiro using tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and I really like it. This film was a big surprise when I first viewed it and I look forward to seeing it again."	1.0
"You better see this episode from the beginning	 because if you start to watch it any later	 you will be confused as to what is happening to Clark's life.<br /><br />Yet	 that is the twist; Clark is stuck in an alternate reality. Lana is devoted to him. Lex lost most of his legs and is in a wheelchair due to the bridge accident when he swerved to miss Clark in the pilot of the series. Martha is married to Lionel. About the only constant is his most loyal friend Chloe	 who still believes in who he is. And	 oh yeah	 he doesn't have any superpowers. He is in a mental institution for putting himself in a fantasy world where he does have powers	 and is ridiculed for believing so. Aside from Chloe	 there is one mysterious figure who believes in Clark: a black man who in the alternate reality is also a resident of the institution	 who believes he is from Mars.<br /><br />Clark must stay true to everything he believes is actual reality	 and not get brainwashed by the institution's psychiatrist	 who is in fact the fourth Phantom Zone escapee.<br /><br />This episode is utterly mind-blowing and shocking. Plus	 it provides a fresh twist from the usual type of ""Smallville"" episode."	1.0
"I've seen this film because I had do (my job includes seeing movies of all kinds). I couldn't stop thinking ""who gave money to make such an awful film and also submit it to Cannes Festival!"" It wasn't only boring	 the actors were awful as well. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen."	0.0
"I could not	 for the life of me	 follow	 figure out or understand the story. As the plot advances it too stays incomprehensible. I'm going to guess and say that there was a preproduction story/plot problem that never got sorted out. The producers could never separate the many details that the novel	 or any novel	 has the time and space to create from the other idea	 which was to make a movie about a serial killer and the killer's pursuit by the police. They ended up with too many things happening in a proscribed feature film time limit. Too bad really because they had a solid cast	 a director who knows how to move things around and excellent cinematography. In fact	 a well made movie that one could enjoy and relax with for a couple of hours."	0.0
"While this was a better movie than 101 Dalmations (live action	 not animated version)	 I think it still fell a little short of what Disney could do. It was well-filmed	 the music was more suited to the action	 and the effects were better done (compared to 101). The acting was perhaps better	 but then the human characters were given far more appropriate roles in this sequel	 and Glenn Close is really not to be missed	 as in the first movie. She makes it shine. Her poor lackey and the overzealous furrier sidekicks are wonderful characters to play off of	 and they add to the spectacle Disney has given us. This is a great family film	 with little or no objectionable material	 and yet it remains fun and interesting for adults and children alike. It's bound to be a classic	 as so many Disney films are. Here's to hoping the third will be even better still- because you know they probably want to make one. ;)"	1.0
"There is such rubbish on the cable movie channels that I hit a gem with this one. From beginning to end it had me gripped and deserves top marks.<br /><br />Father of two sons hears messages from ""God"" to kill people who he is told are 'demons'.<br /><br />When the opening credits showed the director as one of the cast that can often be a warning of a bad film; exceptionally it is the reverse here as the drama is non-stop from beginning to end.<br /><br />And there is not one moment in the movie when one is not fully enthralled as there are no unnecessary or needless sub-plots	 and the script is first class. <br /><br />All the actors give wholly convincing performances especially the lead child actor who is exceptional. <br /><br />This film is at least as good as the likes of 'Silence of the Lambs'."	1.0
"First of all when I saw the teaser trailer for Wendy Wu	 I was definitely excited. Brenda Song	 one of the hottest girls on Disney Channel	 would be doing martial arts and I was fine with that... until I saw the movie. The action was poorly constructed	 the movie couldn't have realated to anyone	 the fighting was unrealistic and it sucked... along with the plot. If you really think about it's a wannabe Buffy the Vampire Slayer	 a girl who is the descendant of other warriors who were women	 a girl wants to ignore her calling and wants to become homecoming queen	 the watcher who bug's her to prepare for a big fight against some ancient evil. The idea just wasn't all that original	 the movie is waste of time."	0.0
"The opening shot was the best thing about this movie	 because it gave you hope that you would be seeing a passionate	 well-crafted independent film. Damn that opening shot for filling me hope. As the ""film"" progressed in a slow	 plodding manner	 my thoughts were varied in relation to this ""film"": Was there too much butter in my popcorn? Did the actors have to PAY the director to be in this ""film""? Did I get my ticket validated at the Box Office? Yes	 dear reader. I saw this film in the Theatre! This would be the only exception I will make about seeing a film at home over a Movie Theatre	 because at home you can TURN IT OFF. Were there any redeeming values? Peter Lemongelli as the standard college ""nerd"" had his moments	 especially in a dog collar. Other than that this ""film"" went from trying to be a comedy	 to a family drama to a spiritual uplifter. It succeeded on none of these fronts. Oh	 and the girlfriend was realllllllllly bad. Her performance was the only comedy I found."	0.0
"The story idea is excellent. Unfortunately	 the execution lets it down.<br /><br />The movie lacks pace	 for one thing. It should be an exciting ride	 but it is slow and more than a little boring.<br /><br />I think the problem's mainly in the screenplay and editing. There aren't enough obstacles and reversals to ratchet up suspense	 and there are scenes which don't really move the story along very effectively.<br /><br />The producers should have seen this in the screenplay and insisted upon a major rewrite. Unfortunately	 when the producer is also the writer and the director	 this evidently ain't gonna happen.<br /><br />Much of the acting seems kind of flat	 and that is down to the director - all the actors have been quite competent in other projects.<br /><br />It's a shame	 because with better writing	 editing and direction	 this could have been a really good thriller."	0.0
"Wow	 I can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie.<br /><br />Although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is Matt lillard	 granted most people probably either think he's too caffeine happy or just plain sucks but we're both the same age and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that he's one of my favorites now. This is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and main star kind of like in SLC Punk	 another great Lillard film.<br /><br />Baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything	 which start to amount to craziness. Also very notable in this movie is another great actor named vincent D'onofrio	 a very under appreciated person in the film industry. The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she isn't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene =)<br /><br />It's a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one. They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode. Matt shows his true prowess as the scheming JAck who initially starts the whole scheme. Vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business. Vince's character is a bit deranged and skitz's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film.<br /><br />The surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy	 well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like. This movie kept me very interested besides the fact Matt was in it	 it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies. Critic's probably won't like this movie	 but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway."	1.0
the film looks like as if the director was forced to make this movie by some gang of terrorists . it should actually be called dino crap.<br /><br />there is nothing good about this movie.. even the actors are not worth a penny. don't waste your time watching this movie. the director should be shot in the head for having the mentality to create such a bad movie . i mean isn't he ashamed of looking at peoples faces after they have seen his movie ? the dinocroc looks as if it was made in power point and pretty much cut-and-paste stuff. and its the same old story . man plays god . creates some creature . it escapes and is happy eating people . and finally a pretty girl and a guy in a sleeveless shirt has to come and kill it . bla bla.. u will figure out the plot in the first 5 minutes of the movie	0.0
"Phantom Lady (1944) Dir: Robert Siodmak <br /><br />Production: Universal Pictures<br /><br />Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis)	 following a nasty fight and split with his wife	 looks to drown his sorrows at the local watering hole. There he spies a woman in a similar emotional state and	 looking for some companionship	 asks her to a show at a club to get both their minds off their problems. She agrees	 but only on the condition that they keep their names to themselves. Sure enough	 when Scott gets home he finds the police there	 waiting to question him. His wife's been murdered. Where were you at 8 o'clock this evening	 asks Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez)? But Scott has an alibi	 right? Only he doesn't know the woman's name. And the bartender remembers Scott but not the woman. Neither does the cab driver. Nor the drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) at the club. Even the dancer at the club	 who Scott clearly caught looking at the woman (they were both wearing the same hat)	 won't acknowledge there was someone with him. Something is going on	 but whatever it is Scott is helpless to defend himself at a trial and is sentenced to death for his wife's murder (on the flimsiest 'evidence' in Hollywood judicial history). It's left to his loyal secretary	 'Kansas' (Ella Raines)	 who's later joined by a sympathetic Inspector Burgess	 to find out the real killer before Scott is executed.<br /><br />Phantom Lady is built on themes that recur	 almost compulsively	 in Woolrich's work. For example	 the schizophrenic antagonist is also seen in Black Angel and The Leopard Man. Additionally	 there is the character who becomes mentally unhinged by the death of a sweetheart or spouse as found in Rendezvous in Black and The Bride Wore Black. It can leave a viewer feeling like he's treading on well worn ground. But in the right hands	 the feverish plots	 sorry dialogue	 the narrative inconsistencies	 all are beside the point. Fortunately	 Phantom Lady was being guided by sound hands.<br /><br />This is Siodmak's first noir. He would go on to distinguish himself as one of the	 if not the	 preeminent practitioners of the style (The Killers	 Criss Cross). Here he is fortuitously paired with cinematographer Woody Bredell (they would be reunited on Christmas Holiday and The Killers). There is some great storytelling done in the camera. In one shot	 the deteriorating mental state of a character is shown as he sits in front of a 3-way mirror	 suggesting multiple personalities. The same character	 who is an artist	 has Van Gogh's self portrait with the bandaged ear hanging on the wall in his apartment. But what Siodmak and Bredell are really doing in Phantom Lady is practically creating the look for noir. Released very early in 1944	 it's all here; the wet pavement	 the bags of atmosphere and dread	 the sharply contrasting b&w	 the wildly expressionistic versions of reality (when Kansas visits Scott in prison)	 the discordant shafts of light	 etc. It is a terrific picture to look at.<br /><br />Franchot Tone aside	 the cast	 as well as the subject matter and relative inexperience of the director (and presumably	 the budget)	 suggests 'B' movie ambitions. I thought Tone was a little hammy. Alan Curtis (High Sierra) is not up to much	 and actually comes off pretty weak in a few scenes. Ella Raines is mostly good (and quite beautiful). Her 'sex scene' with Elisha Cook Jr. is so delirious it has to be seen to be believed. Another standout scene is when Kansas goes after the bartender to question him. It amounts to a chase scene	 as she relentlessly dogs him through the streets	 with a stop at a subway station. Some real good tension in there.<br /><br />*** out of 4"	1.0
"Christ	 oh Christ... One watches stunned	 incredulous	 and possibly deranged	 as this tawdry exercise in mirthless smut unfolds with all the wit and dexterity of a palsied Galapagos tortoise. Can such things be? Does this movie actually exist	 or was I the unwitting guinea pig of some shadowy international drugs company	 sipping my coffee unaware that it had been spiked with a dangerous hallucinogen? I've seen a lot of films	 and a lot of bad films	 but nothing prepared me for this; by the end of it I was a gibbering	 snivelling wreck	 tearing at the carpet with my teeth like a dog	 clawing at the walls	 howling till my lungs were sore. I pleaded desperately	 frenziedly for mercy (to whom this appeal was made	 I don't know)	 and longed with burning desire for the soothing balm of Ozu Yasujiro. Sweet Weeping Jesus	 the memories... sometimes they come back to me. When I'm at my most vulnerable	 when I'm least able to handle them. I shudder	 I break down in tears	 I bite my fingernails till my hands are slathered with blood	 but I can't quite banish the awful flashbacks from my mind. I'm haunted. I'm damaged. I'm a shell of a man.<br /><br />The other user comments here suggest that I am not alone in having undergone this terrifying experience	 which can only mean one of two things: a) the film does	 in fact	 exist	 or b) I am but one victim among legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister proportions. What is quite mind-boggling is that some people seem to have enjoyed their ordeal	 or at least have not been left traumatised by it. Perhaps they're part of the operation. God damn them	 the maniacs!

"I went to school with Jeremy Earl	 that is how I heard of this movie	 I don't really know if it was in the theater's at all. I don't recall the name. I have seen it	 it is like one of those after school specials. The acting is OK	 not great. The plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty corny. So the only comment I can give this movie is ""Eh"" I borrowed the movie from Jeremy	 if I was in a movie rental place	 this is one that I would walk past and after watching it I wouldn't recommend it to anyone past middle school age. I've also noticed that many times when urban kids are portrayed	 the slang is overused or just outdated. Many times I think thats what makes their characters unbelievable."	0.0
"I'm giving ten out of ten it's one of the best movies ever. Absolutely smashed	 stunned and dazed by the whole picture	 marvellous playing of Jason Statham	 Ray Liotta and all the crew	 amazing plot... Just look into yourself and pluck up your courage to admit-it touched your soul	 because it's strange	 but there are all the answers you've been ever looking for... The very best	 mr. Ritchie! THE VERY BEST EVER. Those who were looking for a simple figtings and skirmish keep yelling they are disappointed. But there are lots of shallow movies in Hollywood nowadays	 you can't remember what it was about the next day you had seen it. On the contrary	 Revolver is unique	 I could have hardly expected it's possible to portray such a clear and genius picture of myself	 of everyone who was to watch it. Absolutely unsurpassed	 astounding	 dazzling... One can get insight watching this	 I have no doubt about that. Actually	 no words can express my admiration... I'm still wondering how it was possible to shoot such a movie after years of giddy Hollywood rubbish we had been watching. Thank you from all heart	 it's simply the best."	1.0
"The reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point. It's obvious he hasn't been young or innocent in a very long time	 or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the well-meaning young characters actually thought they COULD make a difference by putting up posters and holding a rave for peace. If only it was that easy. But the cynics sit and sneer at people who earnestly try their best to make things better	 as the situation gets worse and worse every single day. Well	 if you're not part of the solution	 you're part of the problem.<br /><br />The central theme is that revenge begets more revenge	 which begets even more	 in an ever-expanding bloodbath. Both sides will tell you tales of atrocities committed by the other side	 which they think justify their committing even MORE in retaliation. Where does it end? And apparently he missed the significance of ""the bubble"" referred to in the name	 which was that people living in Tel Aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on all around them	 which is partly why they seemed so naive. (He also seemed to think that Ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without a problem	 which tells me he wasn't paying attention when Ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered.) <br /><br />I found it very brave of the director	 the screenplay writer	 and both star-crossed lovers	 to update the Romeo & Juliet story to a modern troubled land	 and to make both lovers male. Let's be honest here: Very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female (young love wins all hearts) -- but when people's uneasiness with their sexuality is added to the fact that	 incredibly	 these same people would rather have them HATE each other	 then the conclusion is inevitable."	1.0
"""the day time ended"" is an incredible picture. in some ways	 it's better than ""close encounters of the third kind."" (i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars.) the special effects ARE cheesy	 but that's a big part of the fun. jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film. it's probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature. the musical score is very good. the story DOESN'T make sense. BUT THAT ONLY MAKES IT ALL THE MORE INTRIGUING. like many of the best works of art	 ""the day time ended"" isn't afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. ""the day time ended"" may be a low budget indie film	 but it isn't too much of a stretch to compare it with the ""existential"" European films of the fifties and sixties. (many of which were low budget independent productions themselves.)"	1.0
"Radiofreccia is a movie about all of us	 about our dreams	 our friends	 our obsessions	 our addictions	 our fears. It is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century. The movie doesn't take a happy or sad approach on things	 it just tells us a story	 one that all of us could have experienced. One of happiness and excitement	 sadness and grief. The power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters	 it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again	 feeling closer to the little town in Emilia Romagna where it takes place. Hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to Freccia and his friends	 listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing Radio Raptus International	 playing their dreams	 our dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh	 it will make you cry at times	 it will shock you and comfort you	 it will give you and take from you. Personally I believe it to have played an important part in my life	 and that of my friends	 and I suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours."	1.0
"Antonioni's movies have aged not well. What always surprised me about them is that	 besides an unquestionable plastic beauty	 there is a dull and didactic ""psychology"" of the characters and situations. Remember	 for instance	 the conversations between Mastroianni and the ""wicked capitalistic"" that wants sing up him in ""La notte""	 or Monica Vitti laughing at the peasants flirting in the train in ""La aventura""	 or Ferzetti dropping the glass of ink at the end of the same film. <br /><br />I have reviewed yesterday ""Zabriskie Point"". In this film there are a lot of nice and elaborate shots of the Rod Taylor office	 the streets and highways of L.A.	 the publicity advertisements	 the deserts	etc.	 that show the fascination of the author in his American journey	 in the same way than Wim Wenders years later. Unfortunately	 there are too a lot of hippie-leftist clichés that spoil the movie: - The boy leaves the meeting	 steals an aeroplane and flies over the desert in order to liberate himself and find ""something different"". - The executives in grey suites speak all the time about speculation. - The girl looks at the ""object women"" in the swimming pool and leaves because she wants not to be like them. - The couple of fat middle-class in the caravan speak	 in front of the beauty of the nature	 of building a hotel and earning a lot of money. - Last but not the least	 a lot of couples making love in the desert. What a hippie platitude!<br /><br />Sorry	 today	 half a century after the ""revolution"" of ""La Aventura"" we can see that the king is naked	 and his films (except ""Le amiche"" and perhaps ""Il grido"") are only a handful of aestheticism and commonplaces."	0.0
"This excellent drama had me in suspense the whole time. I could not take my eyes off the screen for one second because every word kept connecting the pieces to this puzzling murder. This movie really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be. I really did cry in the end (which I don't want to give away!) It also let me realize how cruel and sickening people can be when it comes to murder. <br /><br />The cast was also very good. The only bad cast member was the actress who played Anne Marie. The actress did a great job	 but the director didn't. I say this because he found someone who didn't look a single bit like Anne Marie Fahey herself."	1.0
"This is the last Dutch language film Paul Verhoeven made before going on to make mainstream Hollywood films ""Basic Instinct	"" ""Robocop	"" and ""Total Recall	"" among others. He sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider catching prey in her web before we meet Gerard Reve	 an annoying self-centered writer with a morbid imagination. Gerard has been invited to be the guest speaker at a Literary Club meeting in sea-side town an hour or so from Amsterdam. Verhoeven lets us have glimpses of how Gerard's imagination twists reality. Asked if writers are a bit close to insanity he admits when he reads the newspaper ""and it says 'boom' I read 'doom	' when it says 'flood' I read 'blood	' when it says 'red' I see 'dead.'"" When he tells a story enough times he begins to believe it; ""I lie the truth."" He accepts an offer to be the overnight guest of the Club treasurer	 a beautiful wealthy salon owner. As he gets to know her and learns her husband has died	 he begins to imagine she is 'a black widow.' Is this his more of his reality twist or is she a murderess? This is a psychological drama and in recounting which of these old films have stuck in my memory	 I figured out is my favorite gender. Looking at his body of work it is seems to be Paul Verhoeven's too	 and he is a master in making us question our own understanding of reality. It's a nice change of pace from the usual Hollywood fare. I saw it in 1983 and it is a film that ""stuck."""	1.0
"I saw this on TV the other night or rather I flicked over to another channel every so often to watch infomercials when I couldn't stand watching it any longer. It was bad. Really	 really bad. Not ""so bad it's good"" just flat out bad. How did it get funded? Who thought this was a good idea? An actor friend of mine auditioned and was told he wasn't good enough to play a bad guy but I think what they meant was ""save yourself and runaway from this steaming pile of @#$%."" I bet the rest of the cast had been given the option. To be fair the acting was hard to judge because of the appalling fake American ascents. The shooting was dullllllllllll. The action was awkward and stilted. The dialog was inane. By far the saddest thing was ship. In real life the Interislander ferry is a shabby boat and on film it doesn't scrub up well. Instead of trying very unsuccessfully to make it look like a new crews liner with bits of tinsel wrapped around rusting polls	 I kid you not	 they could have change the script to explain or even celebrate the shabbiness. Dumb	 Dumb	 Dumb. Don't watch this movie	 not even as a joke."	0.0
"I've just finished listening to the director's commentary for this film	 and I think the one big thing I got from it that I agree with is that this film	 like Mann's The Insider	 is completely subjective. It's from Howard's POV. So	 any review or attempt at contemplating a set of comments about it	 as Ebert did	 is really about Nolte's character actually. If you feel	 as he did	 that the film ""does not work""	 then you're saying	 I think	 that Howard does not work. And	 to be frank	 you might be right. Howard's reasoning and personality really wouldn't stand up to professional mental treatments and analysis.<br /><br />But	 hey	 that's the nature of people.<br /><br />Andrew."	1.0
"The one reason I remember this is that it was shown the week after Nigel Kneale`s brilliant QUATERMASS serial was broadcast . The trailers made heavy emphasis that the main character had a mutilated arm which had me hoping he`d be like Victor Caroon from THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT stalking the streets of London .<br /><br />No such luck because THE RACING GAME is just a rather drab thriller with the gimmick of having a hero with a physical disability trying to get to the bottom of investigations of corrupt horse racing . I suppose if you`re a fan of Dick Francis you might enjoy it but setting it in the context of the late 70s when THE SWEENEY had just finished and THE PROFESSIONALS was still being produced 	 there`s something lacking about THE RACING GAME . One trailer featured a car over taking another on a motor way 	 if it`d been a trailer for THE SWEENEY you`d see Jack Regan over taking a car and beating a confession out of the slags who`d done a blag while THE PROFESSIONALS would have over taken a car and blown away the terrorists inside . I think that sums up what`s wrong with this series"	0.0
"Lubitsch's last production but not his least interesting film. Somehow largely ignored by critics as he couldn't finish it himself and as the movie wasn't co-signed by Preminger who he did most of the staging... A very strange mix of musical (a remembrance of The Merry Widow ?)and classic Lubitsch touch sentimentalism (an impossible love-story like Cluny Brown)yet a very clever and intelligent one yet not to be understood as some nostalgia of some lost world but rather a testament on eternal feelings prevailing on the foolishness of mankind and especially men in times of war with a ""moral"" lesson still true today as it was in 1948. Billy wilder as an answer to Preminger who grieved at Lubitsch's funerals about having lost a great man replied that we still had his films and that sums it all up about that Lady in Ermine..."	1.0
"Other reviewers here seem to think this is an awful film. That's simply not true and a little unfair.<br /><br />The acting is of a good quality and the direction moves on with a decent fluidity. I don't think there's anything wrong with the Tarantino-esquire way of interlocking stories together. Perhaps its just a new tool for directors to try. I thought it made the film much more interesting. Perhaps a few elements of the script need tightening	 but that's about the only fault I can find. Nestor Cantillana gives a great performance as Sylvio	 also Antonella Rios is stunning and worth the price of admission alone."	1.0
"There are people claiming this is another ""bad language"" ultra violence Mexican movie. They are right	 but more than that this film is a call to create awareness of what we have become. The awful truth hurts	 or bores when you already have accepted the paradigm of living the third world as the only possible goal. One of the most important things of ""Cero y van cuatro"" is the open invitation to profound reflexion over our current identity. Is that what we all are? Is that all that we want to be? I am abroad and I realized how spoiled is the Mexican society when the Tlahuac Incident came to light. I still cannot understand viewers witnessing a mass broadcasted murder. I nearly puked when I saw some of the images. It was not Irak or Rwanda	 just a tiny village near Mexico City when rampage was carried out with the indulgence of media and government. The recreation of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply. The other stories were good portraying other situations of corruption	 dishonesty	 betrayal and violence	 but I consider ""Tamales de Chivo"" the best one.<br /><br />The movie is deeper than some ""cabrón"" and ""pendejo"" screams. Those are meaningless compared with the actions of the people. With a few exceptions they are all perfect examples of human rubbish. Just like in real life honesty is becoming more the exception than the rule in our country. Moreover	 honesty is only rewarded miraculously."	1.0
"There are two things that I like about Elvira	 and they're both bigger than she is and she keeps them covered up: her wit and her talent. A movie is the best thing to show off how funny she can be or how she commands attention. Looking like a combined clone of Morticia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith	 she inherits a distant relative's estate only to discover that she is really the heiress of the occult. The comedy in this movie is the best thing about it	 but it could have been a lot more scary and chilling. It's mostly a campy fare with as many bad horror movie references in it such as the rioting mob or the fleeing heroine who trips and stumbles on her heels. My favorite part is when she uses her marvelous endowments to break the chains keeping her locked in the cemetary. The ending is sappingly sweet as if it were written by the Bradys	 but the Las Vegas act at the end seems too grandiose for this type of movie."	1.0
A Bugs Life is a great film that is not just for kids but for adults too. The story is set around a colony of ants and their struggle against the evil Grasshoppers who come back every year and steal their food ( A Mirror of the Magnifiscent seven).

"The movie has a great written genre story. It features all of the usual Columbo ingredients; The way Lt. Columbo approaches and bonds to his suspect	 the way the mystery unravels for him	 Columbo's dog	 the cat and mouse play	 which is great in this one and luckily as well some good relieving humor	 mostly involving the Columbo character. It's all written despite the fact that it doesn't even have a truly original concept. Columbo hunting down a detective/murder novel writer had been done more than once before in a Columbo movie.<br /><br />It's also an extremely well directed movie from James Frawley	 who after this directed 5 more Columbo movies	 in the '70's and '80's. He provided the movie with style and some truly great and memorable sequences.<br /><br />It's one of the slower moving Columbo movies	 despite not having a too long running time. This style and approach doesn't always work out well for a Columbo movie but in this movie it does	 which is perhaps not in the least thanks to the acting performances of the movie.<br /><br />Most Columbo movie either starred a big well known star or a star from the early days of film-making	 as the movie its murderer. This movie stars the rather unknown 81 year old Ruth Gordon. She didn't starred in an awful lot of movies throughout her career but she is still well known to some	 mostly for her role in ""Rosemary's Baby""	 which also won her an Oscar. She had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of acting	 which some people might not like though. It earned her 4 more Oscar nominations throughout her career	 prior to her win for ""Rosemary's Baby""	 in 1969. She has some great interaction as well with Peter Falk in their sequences together.<br /><br />The movie also stars a still young G.D. Spradlin. I say young because I only know him from his latest productions out of his career	 despite the fact that he already was 57 at the time of this Columbo production. He is still alive but retired from acting	 ever since 1999.<br /><br />An even better than usual Columbo movie entry.<br /><br />8/10"	1.0

When a well off	 got it made couple with a nice apartment and great life get the notion to adopt this idea was tailor made for them.

"People call this a comedy	 but when I just watched it	 I laughed<br /><br />only once. I guess the problem is that I first saw it when I was 14	<br /><br />and I wasn't old enough to understand that it wasn't meant to be<br /><br />taken seriously. There were quite a few scenes that were meant<br /><br />to be funny	 but I cared too much about the characters to laugh at<br /><br />them.<br /><br />I suggest that you watch this film next time you're falling in love	<br /><br />and try to take it seriously. I think you'll find that	 despite a few silly<br /><br />flaws	 it's one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen."	1.0
"The film is bad. There is no other way to say it. The story is weak and outdated	 especially for this country. I don't think most people know what a ""walker"" is or will really care. I felt as if I was watching a movie from the 70's. The subject was just not believable for the year 2007	 even being set in DC. I think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end. Most didn't stay for the Q&A either.<br /><br />I don't think Schrader really thought the film out ahead of time. Many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didn't know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on. I really didn't get Woody's (Carter) private life or boyfriend either. What were all the ""artistic"" male bondage and torture pictures (from Iraq prisons) about? What was he thinking? I think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for Woody's character (Car). It didn't work. It didn't even seem to make sense really.<br /><br />The only good thing about this film was Woody Harrelson. He played his character (Car) flawlessly. You really did get a great sense of what a ""walker"" may have been like (say twenty years ago). He was great and most likely will never get recognized for it. <br /><br />As for Lauren	 Lily and Kristin... Boring.<br /><br />Don't see it! It is painful! Unless you are a true Harrelson fan."	0.0
"I enjoyed this film far more than anything had led me to anticipate; from reading other comments here	 I suspect it benefits enormously from being seen on a full-size screen in the cinema	 in the company of a cheerful and enthusiastic audience. I was lucky enough to have that experience	 borne up on ripples of laughter from all around	 and had an immensely good time with this undemanding comedy.<br /><br />For it is as a comedy that it shines	 if it shines anywhere at all. The music is nothing special -- in fact	 I hadn't realised it *was* a musical	 and was very surprised when the assembled ancestors burst into half-spoken lyric -- but I do have to admit that the half-threat	 half-promise of 'Oh	 what I'll do...' has proved far more catchy than it ever seemed at the time	 as it's still going round and round in my head!<br /><br />The plot	 such as it is	 largely pivots around the past history of the eponymous Francesca	 a sixteenth-century portrait sporting a distinctly anachronistic hairstyle and fur-coat. Her idea on the sanctity of marriage don't quite jibe with those of her distant descendant	 the Countess Angelina	 and one can almost hear the storyline creaking at the seams under the strain of the Production Code in order to ensure that the heroine arrives unsullied in her much-delayed marriage-bed with the right man...<br /><br />The romance is scarcely earth-shattering	 and in fact the first few scenes	 played pretty well straight	 verge on the tedious. But where script and film really come to life is in the battle of the sexes that follows. The impudence of Douglas Fairbanks Jr's courtship of Betty Grable's married Angelina is equalled only by Betty-Grable-as-Francesca's pursuit of him in turn	 culminating in complete role-reversal in the hilarious fantasy sequence where she -- literally -- sweeps him off his feet. This is probably the comic climax of the plot	 although the consequences of the Colonel's understandable confusion are worked out with a deft touch in the remaining two 'acts' of the operetta-structure	 and the spectacle of Fairbanks' blissful	 bemused awakening is more or less worth the price of admission on its own.<br /><br />Grable is entirely convincing in establishing her two contrasting characters	 wisely gets almost all the (limited) singing opportunities	 and shares the honours where the swathes of quotable dialogue in the various verbal duels are concerned. But in the field of unspoken reaction she is really outclassed by her male supporting leads; Fairbanks in particular is an absolute treat in a number of wordless sequences whose set-up and humour is worthy of the silent screen.<br /><br />This film is too uneven in style to be a classic	 varying from sparkling repartee to hackneyed tedium. But at its best it is quite honestly very funny indeed	 and brought a round of spontaneous applause and laughter across the auditorium at the end as the lights went up. Out of tune with its times	 it may have failed to draw contemporary audiences -- but	 on this showing	 really didn't deserve to be disowned by both Grable and Preminger	 the (uncredited) director. This is no masterpiece	 but a thoroughly entertaining minor work	 and I for one found myself grinning in remembrance all the way home."	1.0
"Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is mildly amusing in this 1970 turkey	 but the script is so lame and insulting that even Goldie Hawn's youth (just after her Oscar win) cannot begin to pull this one out of the mud. As a skirt-chasing celeb in his 40's	 Sellers mostly embarrasses himself to the nth degree.<br /><br />A 3 out of 10. Best performance = ? Nicky Henson plays a young study type.<br /><br />I hope Hawn and Sellers were paid well	 because I see no other reason for tripe like this in 1970 (a very good year for films - CATCH-22	 M.A.S.H.	 HUSBANDS	 JOE	 WUSA	 FIVE EASY PIECES and many others). You can't win them all!"	0.0
"It is not the same as the other films about dancing. A few normal people found themselves from dancing.

"This was a nice attempt at something but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above it's low budget trappings. The use of virtual sets almost works but at some points it fails miserably. They made good use of the small budget I guess. I just wish the story and most of the acting was better. There are a lot of parts where you see what they were aiming for and it would of been great if they actually hit those marks but they don't. Confusing and unbelievable story. Bad DVD transfer too. It doesn't take much for me to watch a movie in one sitting. This I had to shut off. It was too boring. I can do slow movies. But just make them appealing in some aspect. Visually	 story-wise	 acting	 etc. This was lacking in all departments so it never added up to an engrossing experience. Maybe the film maker's next attempt will be better."	0.0
"Slasher films are often seen as the derivative	 repetitive and frankly unoriginal. I happen to to be a horror movie fan	 but this film was just so poor	 words fail me. The script is severely lacking	 the plot is ridiculous	 the acting astoundingly bad. Just an all round stinker	 that I wasted time of my life on. This had all the entertainment value of a 15th sequel to a film that was dire in the first place. <br /><br />Who greenlit this mess?<br /><br />I only liked two things in this movie. The first was the killer's mask - which was nice. The second was the Austrailian affinity with humourous profanity.<br /><br />Save yourself	 and avoid this hideous mess."	0.0
"Domino is a great movie. It's about a young woman names Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) who becomes a bounty-hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle. She joins with two fellow hunters (Mickey Rourke & Edgar Ramirez) and the adventures begin. The script is good. Very down-to-earth and realistic with the tone of the film. The only problem I had with this movie is that it concentrates on the different things that they do	 instead of the character of Domino.<br /><br />Even with that	 Kiera Knightley gives a fierce performance. She shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance. Mickey Rourke follows up his Oscar-Worthy performance in 'Sin City' with another tough-guy performance. Edgar Ramirez really doesn't do anything except speak Spanish every once in a while and stare at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi gives a good supporting performance. Mo'Nique was herself	 although she did surprise me on one particular scene. Lucy Liu has great chemistry with Kiera Knightley in her scenes with her.<br /><br />The best thing about the movie though	 is the direction. Tony Scott's fast-paced style really brings the movie to life. The cinematography is some of the best	 I've ever seen. It takes a regular movie and puts on acid. All the blacks are blacker	 the whites are brighter	 and it has a sort of green glow to it. The action scenes are exhilarating.<br /><br />OVERALL: If you liked Sin City & Man on Fire	 you'll like Domino."	1.0
"The Good:<br /><br />Effective color scheme. Good costumes. Top notch set production. Well detailed CGI buildings and vehicles.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Horrible mixture of actors with all CGI actors mixes Fifth Element with Final Fantasy. The CGI actors look even worse than video games from a few years ago. Flawed logic. A giant pyramid shows up and no one researches it	 no one really even questions it? And there is no explanation as to why the god Horus was even cast out	 nor was there any reason why he must do something as trivial as impregnate Jill?<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />Awful script. So many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas that are not fully realized. The dialog was almost laughable at some points. Random characters and events that are not needed. Dull characters. Jill is supposed to be this mystery	 but apparently she was just a mystery to the writer. There is nothing to her. She is uninteresting and boring to watch. She has no substance	 no texture. Her character has no redeeming qualities. In fact	 there is not one character in the entire film who has any purpose	 any goals (besides the obvious one of Horus)	 any motivation. They are weak and ill-conceived. There are no stakes - the key to screen writing. Horus will not become immortal	 but	 big deal	 he is a bad guy. One cannot even decipher whether Horus or Jill is the main character. That is the problem: devoting half the movie to each character means the writer never fully explores one character	 never brings one to fruition. They are cardboard cut-outs who walk around and talk and pretty much do nothing but explore the fine set pieces. First time director pacing. Slow	 slow	 slow. I am still watching the movie as I write this. I cannot pay attention because it is boring. Everything is flat. Even the action is not interesting because it is short-lived and sometimes unnecessary.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Not worth a watch. Threadbare story	 sub-par character development	 corny CGI does not save the nice set production."	0.0
"The Cat in the Hat is just a slap in the face film. Mike Myers as The Cat in the Hat is downright not funny and Mike Myers could not have been any worse. This is his worst film he has ever been in.

"It is an excellent thriller from Turkey which can make sense.Great job from Gokbakar brothers.<br /><br />First of all	i want to point on screen play.Generally screen play in most films from Turkey is not enough	but GEN has the best shots to be said ""perfect"".And also transition parts are really excellent.<br /><br />On the other hand	""Gen"" has a great topic that influence everyone.Especially	a woman 	who wants to be a psyciatrist in a sanitarium 	has a mother that is a habitual insanity.Principal causes and psychological consequences are given in Gen.The only thing you have to do is to combine all the hints.<br /><br />There is an impressive aggression part Doga Rutkay and Sahan Gokbakar played.This performance may be more realistic than "" Irréversible(Monica Bellucci) "".<br /><br />The last thing i want to say is ""Watch this movie	you'll get confused"""	1.0
"I saw this film recently in a film festival. It's the romance of an ex-alcoholic unemployed man who just came out of a big depression and a single middle-aged woman who works in an employment office (INEM). I found the story very simple and full of clichés	 taking the 'social' theme of the movie and turn it in to a romance comedy. The lead actor did a good job	 he definitely looks like an alcoholic man	 but Ana Belen is not believable as a working class woman	 she looks	 acts and talks very much like a 'high-standing' woman. What I mean is that Ana Belen plays herself. She does it in all her movies anyway. The whole mise-en-scene of the film was very poor. The photography is ugly	 not using well at all the panoramic aspect ratio. The dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times. The comic situations are typical from Gomez Pereira	 but in this case they are not funny at all and are resolved poorly. In my opinion this film is not worth watching. Only if you really love Pereira's previous films you might enjoy this one a little bit. Anyway	 I walked out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The film-maker was by the door. I wonder what a director feels like when he sees someone walking out of one of his films	 specially one that is made to please everybody."	0.0
"The premise and subject about making a criminal realize what his victims went through by capturing his family hostage sounds promising and interesting. But this is the only interesting part which was also dealt 20 years ago with quite finesse by director Ravi Tandon in his film ""Jawab'(1985) too. The problem here is Ace Director Rajkumar Santoshi found himself in some sort of confusion as to whether to make it a fast paced action-thriller (viz. Khakee) or an emotions-rich heavy duty drama (Viz. Damini) and this confusion is quite evident in the final outcome. If we ignore two of his-Pukar (2000) and Lajja(2001)	 this brilliant director has always given us fairly engrossing films with high entertainment value. Therefore this film comes as a surprise	 as to what made this script sensitive director going for half-baked characterization of both of his protagonists-Amitabh Bachchan and Aryeman. As the film is getting over	 audience didn't know whom to hate and whom to sympathize with and this factor is the major limiting force in the complete narration. Therefore what starts as a war between a common man and an underworld don ends on a strange note of self-realization and regret by the Don about what went wrong with his own family. The revelation of Don's son as a real baddie does not come as a surprise element in the climax which if compared to similar situation in 'Khakee"" worked so effectively with Aishwarya's character. That is not all	 there is more to it. The whole dramatization of life of an Underworld Don	 operating from abroad looks quite illogical. His openly landing up at Mumbai from where he is suppose to be absconding as well as running after his enemies and shooting them himself does not look believable. Pitching a mediocre	 newcomer actor like Aryeman opposite Mr. Bachchan is again not a good idea. But nonetheless film has some plus points. Ashok Mehta's fine camera-work	 two good fight sequences (co-ordinator Abbas Ali Moughal)	 some light well-acted scenes of Akshay Kumar in the Ist half	 Santoshi's fast-paced slick treatment and of course Mr. Bachchan as usual trying hard to put some life into his lifeless character. But all these put together does not make this viewing an exciting experience for you and your Family!"	0.0

"Man's Castle is set in one of those jerry built settlements on vacant land and parks that during these times were called 'Hoovervilles' named after our unfortunate 31st president who got stuck with The Great Depression occurring in his administration. The proposition of this film is that a man's home is still his castle even when it's just a shack in a Hooverville.<br /><br />Spencer Tracy has such a shack and truth be told this guy even in good times would not be working all that much. But in a part very typical for Tracy before he was cast as a priest in San Francisco	 the start of a slew of classic roles	 he's playing a tough good natured mug who takes in Loretta Young.<br /><br />One of the things about Man's Castle is that it shows the effects of the Depression on women as well as men. Women had some additional strains put on them	 if men had trouble finding work	 women had it twice as hard. And they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal. Spence takes Loretta Young in who's facing those kind of problems and makes no demands on her in his castle. Pretty soon though they're in love	 though Tracy is not the kind to settle down.<br /><br />The love scenes had some extra zing to them because Tracy and Young were having a torrid affair during the shooting of Man's Castle. And both were Catholic and married and in those days that was an insuperable barrier to marriage. Both Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith quite seriously.<br /><br />Also in the cast are Walter Connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole camp	 Marjorie Rambeau who's been through all the pitfalls Young might encounter and tries to steer her clear and Arthur Hohl	 a really loathsome creep who has his eye on Young as well. Hohl brings the plot of Man's Castle to its climax through his scheming. <br /><br />Man's Castle is grim look at the Great Depression	 not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment."	1.0

She's lucky that Matt Lanter is actually decent. He's the one that carries the movie. <br /><br />I hate that I wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this movie! It's a shame that they got to call it a sequel	 because I was a fan of the original	 which was actually pretty good."	0.0
"One of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams	 rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins. One of the most serious examples in 19th century USA of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of gold-bearing gravely hills on the sides of the Sacramento Valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s. This process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside	 causing the material to wash downhill	 where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment. The sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the Sacramento River or its tributaries. The sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas. Some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields	 where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult. Thus	 the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by Warner.<br /><br />First	 we might ask why Warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor Technicolor	 a very rare treatment in 1938. A story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldn't seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time. The answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors	 with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations. Then	 we might ask why colorless George Brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero	 to be paired with Olivia de Havilland. Among other things	 this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it. Even the usually colorful Gabby Hayes	 in his small role	 seemed unusually subdued. Unfortunately	 I fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film. The portion I saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems. It needed to be more like ""The Good Earth""	 released just the year before. Just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man	 such as Errol Flynn. Finally	 there is the matter of the inane title. Surely	 Warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title. ""Gold or Grain"" is short and to the point. Incidentally	 I understand there is still plenty of gold in 'them thar hills'	 waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining."	0.0
"Keenan Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst directors	 i swear he has no real knowledge on how to make films. he has made one brilliant film and that is scary movie. scary movie 2 was OK too but everything else Keenan has made are real disasters. avoid such titles like don't be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood..... i know	 what a title !!! obviously this film too	 just anything that has Keenans name in the credits.<br /><br />it was an hour and a half on stupid nonsense that never made me laugh. just trust me on this	 maybe women might like this film a little because of some of things that happen but on a whole this film will never be liked by anyone with a good taste in films........ 1/10.......j.d Seaton"	0.0
"I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The movie	 however	 did not meet my expectations. Having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters didn't seem to fit very well with the book. The direction was weak. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There wasn't a real connection with the viewer about what was going on. The dialog didn't explain adequately what was happening. It just seemed slapped together and rushed through. All in all I was very disappointed with the movie. I suppose if you haven't read the book	 it might be ok by itself. At the very least	 it might entice you to read the book	 which you'll probably enjoy more.<br /><br />"	0.0
"Another violent	 angry fantasy from Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a puzzle: it's difficult to tell whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously	 with sardonic intent or operates in complete oblivion. He also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world (and this has some outstanding ones) cannot hide a negligence to story	 dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy. Bacon is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side (`The River Wild') in an attempt to offset his boyish looks; given the material	 however	 Bacon isn't nearly hateful enough to compel. The other principals are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin	 neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who	 when forced to deliver inane dialogue	 embarrass themselves. The climax is a study in preponderance and disbelief has to be truly suspended."	0.0
"From the upper shelf of great Classic Books	 comes this masterful story written by Pearl Buck. The book like the movie is called "" The Good Earth."" It relates the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni) a simple Chinese farmer who begins his day with a trip to the 'Great House' where he has taken a slave woman called O-lan (Luise Rainer) and made her his wife. Almost from the beginning	 she begins to adapt to his kindness by saving a small peach seed and planting it near her new home. During the following years	 O-Lan proves her worth by steadfastly sharing her husband's toil	 troubles and changing fortunes. Through the passing years	 they raise a family and watch their simple household weather both feast and famine. Indeed	 it's at the lowest point in their lives that each discovers the value of companionship	 loyalty and Love. With the changing times	 their growing family is both aided and threatened with friends and relatives	 like their Uncle (Walter Connolly) who is a scoundrel and charlatan	 but is compassionately tolerated. Wang has his 'Old Father' (Charley Grapewin) to advise and remind him of life's fragile and fickle nature. Two notable actors who make impressive appearances in this film are Keye Luke who plays Wang's Elder Son and Phillip Ahn who plays a Nationalist soldier. The film is in Black and White and is wonderfully adapted from the novel. Highly recommended for all audiences. ****"	1.0
"I remember when I first saw this short	 I was really laughing so hard	 that like with a lot of other films that I have seen	 no sound came out! Curly is really great at ""singing"" opera in this one	 I am surprised that he did not consider a career as a professional singer	 because he was really good! <br /><br />If you noticed	 this was filmed near the end of Curly's career as a Stooge	 you could really tell he had changed	 because he had lost weight and was thinner	 his voice was deepening	 his face was getting lined with wrinkles	 though he still could pull it off	 he looked like he was fifty at the age of forty. This was because he was suffering many minor strokes before his big one that ended his career. Be he still managed to pull it off in his last ones! <br /><br />If you don't mind the fact that Curly was really getting very ill at this point	 this is actually one of their funniest shorts. I know that I didn't mind the fact that Curly was really changing	 because I still thought that he was great! <br /><br />10/10"	1.0
"This is another fantasy favorite from Ralph Bakshi; after watching it on YouTube that is. Set in the distant past after the Ice Age	 it is a prehistoric sword-and-sorcery quest between good and evil. Nekron	 Lord of the realm of Ice and his mother Queen Juliana	 has set their sights on conquest of the known world. When their glaciers destroy's the village of a man named Larn	 he (Larn) vows to avenge his people and kill the Ice Lord. Meanwhile	 the sub-human minions of Nekron and Juliana capture Firekeep's King Jarol's sultry daughter Princess Teegra; but she manages to escape	 and eventually meets with Larn	 who promises to escort her back to Firekeep; if the sub-humans don't find them first.<br /><br />This movie did very little box office (as did most of Ralph Bakshi's films)	 but has become a cult classic	 partly for the quality of the art	 a collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famed fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. Also	 I have heard that the screenplay was written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas	 the two men who had done Conan comic book stories	 and the background painters included James Gurney	 the illustrator of the Dinotopia novels; though admittedly I had never read Conan or Dinotopia. And also the painter Thomas Kinkade	 noted for his artwork for figurines	 music-boxes for The Bradford Exchange Company besides paintings. And like Bakshi's films The Lord of the Rings and American Pop	 this movie was rotoscoped	 but the process works better in this film than in the former.<br /><br />So overall	 I think it's one of the best animated fantasy movies ever made	 and an awesome collaboration between two great minds - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. With plenty of fantasy	 sexual innuendo	 and thrilling adventure."	1.0

"Looking at some of the negative posts	 you really have to wonder what some people do for fun....<br /><br />I was lucky enough to see the film during its all-too-brief theatrical run. The audience laughed its heads off. I'm watching a tape of it as I type and it's still dang funny!<br /><br />It's also got a sweet side	 with unexpected turns of genuine pathos. The late	 great Royal Dano is especially effective as the lonely	 down-on-his-luck farmer Wrenchmuller. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson are great as the lead kids. And the actors in the Martian suits	 although limited to mime	 do a great job<br /><br />Another thing to look for is the background details. The film is full of homages	 pastiches	 and references to other SF and fantasy films. Take a look at the Martian costumes next time. One of them is wearing a Marty McFly costume	 another is a Ghostbuster	 a third is in a House Atreides uniform	 and a fourth is wearing a Last Starfighter flightsuit."	1.0
"All of you who despaired looking at the emptiness and weaknesses of Disney Studios' last productions	 here comes something that should heal your wounds... Once and for all	 A Bug's life brings the proof that purely synthetic pictures conducting a good scenario provides more interest than fake ""hand-made-old-Disneys-like"" drawings (see the Lion King	 Pocahontas	 and all the latest productions where you sadly regret that Bambi's magical background and atmosphere are gone forever).<br /><br />A bug's life (1001 Pattes for my fellow french cinemaniaks !) succeeds in avoiding all the imperfections that make you awaken in the middle of the movie and say ""Hey	 this thing is computer generated !"". No weak parts	 a tremendous effort showing its efficiency in the backgrounds and the general look of the sets	 an astonishing 3D bird (close to perfection in its imitation of reality)... and that's only to mention the technical aspects.<br /><br />The scenario	 my friends	 the real backbone of a motion picture	 has some thickness ! Curiously	 and obviously thanks to Lasseter's team	 there is practically no musical sequence in A bug's life. Which means the story is long and rich enough to free itself from these 3 or 4 minutes that some kids appreciate	 but most others dislike (same thing for the parents or the anime fans	 like me). This movie reminded me of a really old movie featuring Steve Martin and Chevy Chase : the 3 Amigos ; it had basically the same background story (a whole mexican village living in the fear of a few bad guys hires gunmen (who finally turn to be actors) to protect them	 etc...). Simple	 but efficient	 and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of vicious insects.<br /><br />Since Microcosmos	 many movies tell tales of insects	 their lives	 fears and hopes	 but I do think that A bug's life is the funniest and best directed of all. The humanisation process has been perfectly well achieved... And the whole audience was captivated by Flik's (aka Tilt in France) adventures.<br /><br />A big thank you for Lasseter's team	 especially for the last 30 seconds... it's so strange and great at the same time to see a whole theater caught in laughter while the bugs/actors forget their lines or hit the camera...<br /><br />And finally	 especially for those of you who have seen the french version	 other congratulations go to the dubbing actors who made a great synchro work on this movie. A bug's life is a really good piece of entertainment	 and I think it will soon become part of my collection of videos (a privilege granted to extremely few movies	 and that's not a problem of storage room :). Go and see it	 that's an order."	1.0
"I found about the movie ""Holes"" by hearing from people that it wasn't typical Disney	 that both kids and adults both got into the story. Folks	 let me tell you I wasn't disappointed. ""Holes"" is based on the novel by Louis Sachar and follows the adventure of Stanley Yelnats	 a boy who gets sent to a strange juvenile detention camp out in the desert. He befriends a boy nicknamed Zero and together they set out on adventure that changes their lives. It was a very interesting	 unique	 different and funny story. I didn't know quite what to expect when I watched it. It was interesting to see the story come together like pieces of a puzzle. The boys who played the juvenile delinquents were all very funny and Jon Voight was just hilarious as Mr. Sir. Now that I've seen the movie	 I have to read the book. Most recommended!"	1.0
"As the film begins a narrator warns us THE SCREAMING SKULL is so terrifying you might die of fright--and if such happens a free burial is guaranteed. Well	 I don't think any one has died of fright from seeing this film	 but a few may have died of boredom. THE SCREAMING SKULL is the sort of movie that makes Ed Wood look good.<br /><br />Very loosely based on the famous Francis Marion Crawford story	 SKULL is about a wealthy but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died under mysterious circumstances. Once installed in his home	 she is tormented by a half-wit gardener	 a badly executed portrait	 peacocks	 and ultimately a skull that rolls around the room and causes her to scream a lot. And to her credit	 actress Peggy Webber screams rather well.<br /><br />Unfortunately	 her ability to do so is the high point of the film. The plot is pretty transparent	 to say the least	 and while the cast is actually okay	 the script is dreadful and the movie so uninspired you'll be ready to run screaming yourself. True	 the thing only runs about sixty-eight minutes	 but it all feels a lot longer. Add to this a truly terrible print quality and there you are.<br /><br />There are films that are so bad they are fun to watch. It is true that THE SCREAMING SKULL has a few howlers--but the film drags so much I couldn't work up more than an occasional giggle	 and by the time the whole thing is over your head will roll from ennui. If it weren't for Peggy Webber's way with a scream	 this would be the surefire cure for insomnia. Give it a miss.<br /><br />GFT	 Amazon Reviewer"	0.0
"This movie surprised me in a good way. From the box I got the impression that it was an action thriller but it was too funny to be a thriller	 even though it was somewhat exciting.<br /><br />There's a lot of nice one-liners and funny situations in this movie and James Belushi was born to do Bill Manucci	 he does a great job. The rest of the cast ain't half-bad either and especially Timothy Dalton is a treat.<br /><br />The story can get pretty confusing at times as new characters shows up during the film. Things get more complicated as nobody seldom tells the truth about things. If you don't pay attention things might get a bit messy in the end but I really liked it.<br /><br />Louis Morneau isn't all that well known but he has done a perfectly OK job with this one and I never really grew impatient while watching the movie.<br /><br />Made men is well worth checking out."	1.0
"A have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an SOB who has a long term girlfriend. Of course the SOB is very good-looking	 charming	 etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman. Watching Jean Pierre Leaud's character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends. It's tragic	 and you know she's going to end up very hurt	 but there's nothing you can do. Leaud is brilliant. Totally empty. A blank throughout	 he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants.<br /><br />The scene two hours in when Leaud and Lebrun have made love	 and the next morning he puts on a record and	 very sweetly and charmingly	 sings along to amuse her is brilliant. The ""What the hell am I doing here with this idiot"" expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come.<br /><br />It's a long film	 but see it in one go	 preferably in a cinema. Takes a while to get into	 but then the time just disappears."	1.0
"I liked it! The plot was weird	 Drew Barrymore and DC making out was awkward for both of them. Drews acting was dodgy in places but this could be down to her life at the time. Dennis Christopher as the shrink was pretty cool	 and as always he does his best - i'm a major Dennis fan anyway	 that's why i bought the DVD.<br /><br />I didn't get the ending! that weird animatronic red skeleton thing looked just like it was out of filmschool	 which is OK i guess but it could have been more. <br /><br />....and the whole thing with the knife- if it was that uncomfortable why didn't they just get rid of it? <br /><br />It was very confusing as to when it was the Doppelganger weird thing or when it was DC-or was it Dennis all the time? Because the Doppelganger made out with Dennis and Patrick. In the scenes with Patrick if it was Dennis as the Doppelganger then I think Patrick would notice.<br /><br />The music was OK but obtrusive in places	 the whole orchestral score seemed to be revolving around a theme but this theme was overdone.<br /><br />A big mix of lots of blood and gratuitus shots of Drew nude. <br /><br />All in all a bit of a GPM-Guilty Pleasure Movie. Don't read too much into it	 don't look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you wont find it. There are some diamond moments and goofs galore- WATCH IT AND JUST HAVE A BIT OF FUN WITH IT!"	1.0

"""Women? They're all scrubbers...!"" <br /><br />No	 not a good translation; not at all! This lags behind the previous year's ""Dad's Army""	 entirely missing the special	 small-screen magic of the seminal television sitcom original	 and failing to play interestingly at all with the big screen... you could just about say that this film well represents a Britain entering decline	 and more precisely even than that	 a *British film industry* entering decline. And that is hardly a recommendation	 is it? To be an exemplar of saddening folly...<br /><br />All that remains after the subtlety of the TV original has been surgically stripped away	 by Cliff Owen	 Galton and Simpson are: endless	 dilapidated musical cues	 yawn	 from the Ron Grainer theme... bolstered sentimentality (that shoddy	 thick-eared ending... how much bolder does the second Steptoe film seem in comparison) an increased seediness - with director and writers seemingly detaching themselves completely - fully applicable to something like the 'misbegotten monstrosity' (yours truly on this site) from 1973	 ""The Mutations"". There is a strangely botched	 cut-adrift tone about the scene where Harold is beaten up in a rugby club	 that I partly hate and recoil it (so far	 as a friend intimated	 from the mood of the TV series...)	 but this at least seems an original slant	 and emblematic of tensions just rising to the boil in the Britain of 1972... There is	 however	 an implied prostitute	 aye of a 'heart-of-gold' who turns loose woman-traitor 'pon poor auld 'Arold - and beyond-caricature writing of the 'class' element; not to mention	 surprisingly misjudged performances from the usually redoubtable leads. Brambell and Corbett collude with the script	 and indeed fail to cure it of an essential ham. What would Anthony Aloysius Hancock have made of it all...? I will merely concede that a few moments just about work - chiefly those where G & S play things a little more carefully and B & C touch tenderer nerves - and it is not on the whole an unwatchable affair. <br /><br />But	 and oh	 how this pains me to say it: it is tiresome	 boring	 both wilfully detached from reality and what made the TV series great	 and also fully in tune with the lazy	 tawdry	 misogynist 'fuck it	 that'll do...' actuality of much of what was allowed to pass for mainstream film-making in the Britain of the time."	0.0
"American icon Henry Fonda portrays ""Elegant"" John Howard	 an aging trucker who has had his beloved big rig ""Eleanor"" repossessed after a lengthy hospital stay has forced him to miss his payments. Deciding that he would like to make just one more perfect run	 he breaks out of the hospital	 steals back Eleanor	 and hooks up with old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan)	 who is in need of relocating her troupe of prostitutes.<br /><br />Fondas' wonderful performance is a natural anchor for a film that tugs at the heartstrings as effectively as it tickles the funny bone in the more comedic scenes. A superb cast including Robert Englund	 as a reluctant young sidekick	 Susan Sarandon (who also gets co-producer credit)	 and Dub Taylor (a delightful ham	 as always	 in the most blatantly comedic portion of the picture) helps immeasurably.<br /><br />The ultimately life-affirming nature of the picture and the poignancy of the journey carry incredible weight; this is a picture	 that provided you get into it	 you can remember long after it's over.<br /><br />The promise of the open road is vividly displayed here; the countryside just looks beautiful. Set to Craig Safans' wonderful music score	 it's a remarkable picture in terms of aesthetics.<br /><br />It loses a little something in its final act (the characters played by John Byner and Austin Pendleton are little more than intrusions)	 but it still maintains its good vibes thanks to the appeal of its central characters.<br /><br />Not at all the exploitation / drive-in schlock picture one might expect from the title (especially its alternate title	 ""The Great Smokey Roadblock"")	 it's a rewarding movie experience that I can recommend without qualms.<br /><br />9/10"	1.0
"Magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming	 shrieking	 overwrought	 hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret	 guilt and pain. PT Anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess.<br /><br />A look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent	 and they were. I just wish that every scene didn't involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused.<br /><br />I also think that Anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film. The opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at. But the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display. I kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself	 but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution. Throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of Anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the Old Testament.<br /><br />I will say that the music by Aimee Mann was great and I'll be looking for the Soundtrack CD. In short	 a good movie to look at and listen to (the music	 that is) if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been"	0.0
"This movie was awful. The ending was absolutely horrible. There was no plot to the movie whatsoever. The only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice. If the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story	 it would be worth watching. Instead	 Robert DuVall's and James Earl Jones' performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline...or lack thereof. Not only was I left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie....well an actual movie...not just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason. It was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only thing special was how Robert DuVall portrayed a rambling	 senile	 drunk	 old man. Nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end. When the movie ended	 I sat amazed...amazed that I sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while. It never happened! The cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and I realized that I had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning. It wasn't even a story. The entire movie takes place in a day's worth of time. That's it. It was one day in the life (and death) of some Southerners on a plantation. How much of a story can take place in a single day (other than the movie Training Day)? The acting performances by the entire cast were excellent	 but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie...if you can even call it a movie."	0.0

"The Tooth Fairy is set in a small town somewhere in Northern California where Peter Campbell (Lochlyn Munro) has brought a farming property which he is renovating & planning to turn into a holiday inn	 he is joined by his girlfriend Darcy Wagner (Chandra West) & her young 12 year old daughter Pamela (Nicole Munoz) who arrive to help for the weekend. While exploring the property Pamela meets another young girl named Emma (Jianna Ballard) who warns her that evil lurks within her new home	 she tells a tale of an evil old witch known as the Tooth Fairy who takes baby teeth from children & then kills them. Pamela is worried & becomes even more so when she falls off her bike & her last baby tooth falls out	 it's not long before the evil ghost of the Tooth Fairy has her eyes on Pamela's tooth & just for kicks she also decides to kill anyone she comes across...<br /><br />Directed by Chuck Bowman I thought The Tooth Fairy was just another poor straight-to-video low budget horror film that fails to distinguish itself from the countless other's which litter video shop shelves & fill late night obscure cable TV schedules	 basically it's not very good. The script by producer Stephen J. Cannell	 Corey Strode & Cookie Rae Brown is a complete snooze-fest for the first 40 odd minutes	 nothing of any great interest happen during this period at all & is basically dull exposition as if this stuff was going to surprise anyone. It introduces the character's	 sets the Tooth Fairy legend up & that's it. The second half of the film improves slightly but even then it's hardly spectacular stuff	 there are a few decent set-piece gore scenes but apart from that it's all very predictable & forgettable stuff. The character's aren't great & most of them are there purely to be killed off	 the story has inconsistencies like the story of the Tooth Fairy herself	 it says she kills children after they give her their baby teeth so why does she go on an indiscriminate killing spree that has nothing to do with teeth? What happened to her after the prologue set during 1949? Why has she come back as a ghost? Despite being a ghost of some sort she seems very human having to open doors herself & using weapons to kill people	 there is no attempt to make any use of the supernatural elements except the ghostly children who are played for maximum sentiment.<br /><br />Director Bowman does OK	 it's reasonably well made & there are a couple of half decent scenes but nothing to get that excited about. There's nothing I would describe as scary or atmospheric in here & don't take any notice of the comparisons between this & Darkness Falls (2003) as besides the teeth thing they're quite different. The gore is OK	 someone is shoved into a wood-chipping machine	 there's a decapitation	 someone has their penis chopped off & the best scene when someone is nailed to a door & then has their stomach hacked open with an axe & their guts slide out.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $1	500	000 The Tooth Fairy is generally well made but there's nothing special on show here. The acting isn't anything great but it's not too bad & unusually I didn't find the child actors that annoying so that's something I suppose.<br /><br />The Tooth Fairy is the usual just below average low budget modern straight-to-video horror fare that seems everywhere these days	 if you can find a cheap copy then it might pass 90 odd minutes if your not too demanding otherwise it's pretty poor & forgettable stuff."	0.0
"James Cagney is best known for his tough characters- and gangster roles but he has also played quite a lot 'soft' characters in his career. This musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie Cagney would star in.<br /><br />Cagney is even doing a bit of singing in this one and also quite an amount of dancing. And it needs to be said that he was not bad at it. He plays the role with a lot of confidence. He apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time	 so it actually isn't a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career. He obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing him in.<br /><br />The movie is directed by Lloyd Bacon	 who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre. His earliest '30's musicals pretty much defined the musical genre and he also was responsible for genre movies such as ""42nd Street"". His musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really. '30's musicals never were really about its singing	 this was something that more featured in '40's and later made musicals	 mainly from the MGM studios.<br /><br />As usual it has a light and simple story	 set in the musical world	 that of course is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way. It nevertheless is a fun and simple story that also simply makes this an entertaining movies to watch. So do the characters and actors that are portraying them. Sort of weird though that that the total plot line of the movie gets sort of abandoned toward the end of the movie	 when the movie only starts to consists out of musical number routines.<br /><br />The musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done	 even though I'm not a too big fan of the genre itself. Once again the musical numbers also feature a young Billy Barty. he often played little boys/babies/mice and whatever more early on in his career	 including the movie musical ""Gold Diggers of 1933""	 of one year earlier. <br /><br />A recommendable early genre movie.<br /><br />8/10"	1.0
"I admit I had some trepidation when I first saw the previews for this film. Was VH-1 treading on hollow ground here? I mean	 Harris and Quinn don't really look or even sound like John or Paul. But I have to admit	 this film really surprised me. It's far from the exploitation film I expected. Instead	 it's a character study	 a low-key	 whimsical	 and ultimately bittersweet look at friendship	 and the ultimate lesson we all learn: it's hard	 if not impossible	 to capture what we once had	 and what has passed us by."	1.0
"As drunken millionaire playboy Arthur Bach	 Dudley Moore is perfect as a grown man trapped in childhood. As it turned out	 the role fit Moore so perfectly	 it trapped him as an actor as well. Many disappointments soon followed (including this film's pale sequel)	 yet that doesn't diminish the charm or appeal of this picture	 which is cleverly written and directed. Some of Moore's drunk scenes are forced	 parts of the film are wobbly	 but the cast performs with so much relish it's a difficult movie to resist. It has a very big heart and gives Oscar-winner John Gielgud a sly	 dryly amusing role as Arthur's valet	 Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous rapport. Liza Minnelli (as a blue-collar love-interest) is sassy in a low-key and Moore is brash	 but deft and lively; he never shook off the shadow of Arthur	 but at least we have this document of a career high-point to cherish. *** from ****"	1.0
"I can't say this is one of the best films I have ever seen. But then again	 I can't say it's one of the worst I have ever seen.<br /><br />OK	 so it's basically a girl does skating	 is good at it	 wants to go to an expensive school	 can't afford it and has to take a Hockey Scholarship. She has to hide her skating secret from her friends.<br /><br />Personally	 I didn't like the actress playing Katelin. She absolutely couldn't cry to save her life	 just made wailing sounds	 like a toddler pretending to cry to get it's own way.<br /><br />Katelin was just an annoying person. The way she tried to act all nice and helpful to people. Also the part where the two skaters are calling her names and they say something about her choreographer and she says she 'draws the line' made me cringe.<br /><br />We all knew where it was going to go with her and Spencer. Classically they didn't like each other and sort of get together at the end was just typical.<br /><br />Overall	 I think this is a movie to watch if you like skating but if you don't mind the main skater being extremely annoying. It's good to kill time basically."	0.0
"This Film was really eye-opening. I have seen this film several times. First	 when I was four and I actually remembered it and then when I was 12. The whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving God out of our everyday lives or just Plain going the extra mile to insult him.<br /><br />A great Movie for Non-believers and Believers alike!"	1.0
"When I noticed that ""Hamish Macbeth"" was being broadcast in the United States	 I was thrilled. I then had the misfortune to watch the darn thing. I adore M. C. Beaton's books about the wonderful Scottish Constable. The characters in the book are entertaining and very well-written. The powers that be who are responsible for this mish-mash apparently have never have read one of Beaton's books. Only the name ""Hamish Macbeth"" has anything to do with the series. Besides the lack of familiar characters	 I find the whole show offensively loud. It seems that the actors feel they must shout their lines and scream at each other. If you love M. C. Beaton's adorable Hamish Macbeth don't waste your time on this rubbish."	0.0
"I thought before starting with these movie that it might be a good one	 but when i started with it i found it really awful. They said movie is being made in Afghanistan but i think 95% of the movie is shot in India. you can see Indian made cars. you can see lars drinking bisleri(an Indian water brand)	 Hindi written on the road	 you can also see temples in Afghanistan *hahah* its really funny and many more stuff which proves its not shot in Afghanistan. I think one should not waste his/her time watching this movie.. pure time waste.. i would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but don't watch this waste of time"	0.0
"An attempt at crossover to appeal to those who don't appreciate opera	 exploiting the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time	 it fails badly. All that is desirable in this movie is the opera	 and one can best find a recording of Pavarotti doing what he does best. The plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals his throat which has suddenly become troublesome. <br /><br />Only because it came out so long ago is it largely forgotten. Like most opera stars	 Pavarotti is a decent actor and has stage presence aside from his singing talent	 and nothing that he does in this movie negates that opinion. His culpability lies in not rejecting the horrid script. Perhaps because great operas can have silly stories he tolerated this one.<br /><br />Who knows	 except those involved? Do we need to know? <br /><br />The plot is weak and trite. This movie is like trudging through cold mud to pick off a few juicy tidbits (the opera music) hanging above the mud. We have other ways in which to appreciate the great Pavarotti	 and this one isn't one of them. Just get one of his many superb opera or vocal-concert recordings and recognize the master tenor where he is most suited.<br /><br />It would be one of IMDb's 100 Worst Films if more people remembered it and gave it some votes; it would fit neatly in a list including several efforts of singers	 actors	 models	 and athletes to exploit their popularity through film. Very often it all goes badly wrong due to incompetent acting or a horrible script. Pavarotti would have been a decent actor had he not shown such a superb voice. However effective he is as an actor (opera requires it)	 not even Jimmy Stewart could have rescued this turkey of a script.<br /><br />I give it a polite 3 of 10 because someone may have become a fan of Pavarotti's singing and of opera because of this movie."	0.0
"this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue. what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga. the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for. there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection	 'comics underground japan'	 and it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here. i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this	 as it explains some of the ""plot"" of the movie	 which is otherwise inexplicable. animation wise this is pretty decent	 good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well. it jumps in and out of episodes	 as the characters	 a cat and his brain-dead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images: a boat	 a circus	 a desert. for a mere half hour they go through a number of semi-plots and settings	 which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the long-running manga to adapt at random	 but primarilly selected visually. knowing what's going on might somewhat increase appreciation. this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show	 cartoon sushi	 in particular a short that features a cat chasing a man's severed butt-cheek around the house. only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes [though not all that easy to tell what's going on]. the dvd of this has director's commentary and a ""making of"" features	 but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them. i'm giving this a 8/10 for now	 here isnt much to compare it to in anime	 and i hope for more like this."	1.0
"Who would think Andy Griffith's ""Helen Crump"" (Aneta Corsaut) had a Steve McQueen movie in her past? But that is only one of several weird and wonderful things about the ultimate 1950s teenagers-battle-creatures movie	 which might best be described as Rebel Without A Cause meets God Knows What From Outer Space. The Rebel is Steven McQueen (who would shortly decide that ""Steve"" sounded less prissy)	 a good boy with just enough wild to be interesting; the very wholesome yet understanding girlfriend is the aforementioned Aneta Corsaut. It was bad enough when their date was disrupted by teenage hot-rodders	 but they are considerably more nonplussed when they encounter a gelatinous	 man-eating What Is It that rides down to earth on its own hotrod meteor--and begins gobbling up townfolk right and left. But will the grown ups believe them? Of course not	 what do they know	 they're just kids!<br /><br />The movie is teeny bopper at its teeny bopping best. The actors take the rather pretentious script very seriously	 with many a soulful look into each other eyes	 and the ""adult"" supporting cast probably says ""Kids!"" very third sentence or so. But the real pleasure of the film its creature	 which is well imagined	 well-executed	 and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense. And although clearly on the cheap side (check out those miniature sets	 guys!)	 THE BLOB is actually a fairly well-made film--and there's that catchy little theme song thrown in for good measure. The 40-plus crowd (myself included) will enjoy the movie as nostalgia	 but that won't prevent them from hooting right along with the younger set at its whole-milk-and-white-bread 1950s sensibility	 and the film would be a great choice for either family-movie night or a more sophisticated ""grown ups only"" get together. Make plenty of Jello cubes for movie snacking! Gary F. Taylor	 aka GFT	 Amazon Reviewer"	1.0
"""Home Room"" came as a total surprise. Not having a clue as to what it was all about	 it paid off big time because it doesn't hold any punches and what we see is how lives are changed by the act of a disgruntled young man who decided to victimize his class mates	 who are the innocent victims of his rash actions.<br /><br />Paul Ryan	 the director	 who is working and editing his own material	 is a talented man who is rewarded by some amazing acting all around by his cast.<br /><br />Alicia Browning is an older girl who is trying to graduate high school. She has been away a couple of years and doesn't seem to be in the same wave length of the other students. For one	 she is a rebel with a punk look	 lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares to come near her orbit. Alicia was among the students in the home room where nine students have died	 supposedly killed by her boyfriend. Alicia	 we realize	 is a wounded girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal in her life	 but we are not given any clues to that effect.<br /><br />What follows is the aftermath of the tragedy	 as it concentrates on a young woman who has survived it. Deanna Cartwright is a wealthy teen ager who shouldn't have been at the school	 at all. When a ricochet bullet hit her	 she is hospitalized with more than a wound. She is trying to get over this dark period in her mind but the nightmares don't let her forget.<br /><br />Alicia is made to go to the hospital by the school principal. Since she doesn't cooperate with the police	 the head of the school wants her to see Deanna in her terrible state and perhaps she will soften up and will tell the authorities what she knows. Alicia dislikes Deanna	 but in a matter of days	 both girls will make peace. We don't realize until the last sequence what really happened that horrible day in school.<br /><br />Busy Phillips makes an excellent Alicia and Erika Christiansen is equally good as Deanna. Victor Garber	 James Pinkins	 Taylor Holland	 and the rest of the cast play as an ensemble.<br /><br />The film has an intensity because it's not explicit in showing how the shootings occurred	 which helps the tone that Mr. Ryan wanted to give this movie."	1.0

"I can't believe this movie was made as recently as 1984. It's got some laughable acting	 not to mention one of the stupidest plots ever. Who would ever ask fat Texas sheriff Joe Don Baker to escort an Italian he illegally arrested in Mexico back to Italy? Not to mention that the title of the movie tells you pretty much nothing about it - in fact	 it's about as generic a title for a wannabe action/cop film as I can think of.<br /><br />I'm glad I only saw this on MST3K with Mike and the bots as a shield. They remark on the female lead's resemblance to Elaine from Seinfeld (""None of them are spongeworthy"") and riff non-stop on Baker's weight. This movie probably isn't worse than ""Mitchell	"" but Baker's reputation definitely precedes him here: when his title comes up at the beginning of the film	 Tom says	 ""I wish I was illiterate so I wouldn't have to read that."""	0.0
"I'm sitting here Nov 2006 and I still can't help rave about this movie. Arnold's best movies came in about a 4-5 year span. Running Man	 Predator	 and Total Recall (1990). All 3 are amazing. The cheesy one liners by Arnold in this movie will make you laugh on more than one occasion. I find the acting in this movie surprisingly good as was the case in Predator and Totall Recall. They did a great job in trying to make the scenes futuristic as it is supposed to take place in 2017	 but you can't help but snicker at the 80's style haircuts on the men and woman in the crowd and the normal television monitors in the Running Man studio which we all know here in 2006 are on the way out with the emergence of flat panel and HDTV's. Also the computer graphics of the ""The Running Man"" game show intro would not look like that in 2017. Nevertheless the storyline is absolutely fantastic. Not once during this movie did I want to get up and not care about the ending which is something I do often with today's movie's. I really think that Arnold's acting is much better than he's given credit for. Now I would not have elected him governor but that's California for you. Buzzsaw	 Dynamo	 Fireball	 SubZero are fantastic ""stalkers"" as well and I find the producers don't try to overkill the fight scenes. When the stalker is dead...he's dead. It doesn't go on for 20 minutes each. The stalker scenes are quick and entertaining but they don't try and overplay it. I give this movie a 10/10 and that's coming from someone who doesn't enjoy a lot of movies these days. If you get the right actors and the right story then the futuristic graphical displays that you'd see in 2006 are not important or necessary."	1.0
"This film is awful. Not offensive but extremely predictable. The movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid-60's. The father	 the principal at the school	 is going through a mid-life crisis. Enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students' minds with some thought-provoking stuff	 like think for yourself. The principal doesn't agree with her teaching but she is pretty. You can connect the dots. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder wannabe Tara Frederick) is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live. She gets some bad advice	 hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning wasn't being taught at her school. Shocking! Seeing that director Paul Shapiro has mainly worked in TV	 this movie plays like a more adult version of an after-school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms."	0.0
"Sunday would not be Sunday without an action movie	 and when you want intense combat	 you turn to Tom Berenger (Platoon).<br /><br />Here he plays a sniper in the jungle going after rebels and drug lords. Life's a bitch	 so he gets a green office type (Billy Zane) to help on the mission.<br /><br />The film is in the hands of Luis Llosa	 who stunk up Anaconda. he doesn't do much better here	 but Berenger makes the movie worthwhile.<br /><br />Sure	 it may be a little long - who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle	 but is is good	 tense action when the time is right."	1.0
"Before I see on this film	 I see a lot of comments	 which everyone has a great view of the film good or bad...<br /><br />What I really want to point out is the acting on Woody Harrelson behalf	 he may not be in many parts of the film	 but when he appears or even the intro	 I was astonished by Will Smith's and Woody Harrelson ""message"" they tried to create and maybe slip the entire plot until the end to really understand what is going on.<br /><br />I am not a very sentimental person	 I believe that a good deed should not have remorse or pity behind it. But a act to show redemption	 there is not many films that in my point of view can show this. This is one of them that can.<br /><br />I agree with one person that commented about this film showing acts of ""suicide"" is a downfall	 however I do not believe that is the ""message"" the film is trying to send	 but ""sacrifice"". A bit to the extreme	 but that is the message in MY opinion.<br /><br />This film has potential. The acting it is worth every penny	 the script is unbelievable. from a person that doesn't really like watching drama films... if you like drama this is a must go watch."	1.0
"Cinderella is one of Disney's greatest films	 one of those films I think you appreciate more the older you get. Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairytale. I consider the film to have been the greatest of his films at the time of its release. The characters became more dimensional than earlier films	 creating more depth to appreciate the characters more. Cinderella herself is	 in my opinion	 one of the greatest characters Disney ever created. With her kindness and dash of dry humor	 she is extremely likeable; however	 it is the inspiration she provides which makes her memorable. Like many people she is an endless dreamer	 and she holds onto her dreams	 never giving up. Even in the most adverse of situations	 her dreams endure	 and she won't let anyone take that away from her. Her example should serve as inspiration to everyone	 and encouragement to never let go of your dreams."	1.0
"Here's how you do it: Believe in God and repent for your sins. Then things should turn around within the next day or so. <br /><br />Until the last fifteen minutes	 this movie just plays as a bad recap of a drunk's crappy life. His mom dies. His stepmom's a b_tch. His dad dies. He drinks. He gets married. He has kids. He drinks some more. His wife gets mad. He disappoints his kids. The wife threatens to leave. He calls up a reverend late night b/c he wants to kill himself. Then after the recap happens	 that's when we get the ""Left Behind""-like subtle message.<br /><br />""He needed a paycheck"". This is the phrase I had to repeat over and over once credits started to roll so I wouldn't lose my respect for Madsen.<br /><br />Madsen drops to his knees and begs Christ's forgiveness. Once he does	 he walks outside and actually says that he sees the world in a different way. He tells his wife that he's found God and that's good enough for her. Flip scene four months and the wife is tired of going to church. End the movie as Madsen walks by the bar and gives a soliloquy about how happy he is with Christ and without alcohol. Final moment? He gives a little dismissive wave to the bar (i.e. sin house) and give a gay	 Miami-Vice	 after-school special congratulatory jump in the air as the camera freeze-frames. See why I had to repeat the phrase? ""He needed a paycheck"".<br /><br />Man this movie is bad. The B-Grade 80's production values don't help much. The script could have easily been a ""Touched By An Angel"" episode. It could have been knocked out in 30 minutes plus commercials. The acting is wooden and never believable. Even Madsen	 of whom I'm a big fan and is the sole reason I sat through this	 makes it clear that this is his first acting job and he doesn't know his a$$ from his elbow yet on camera. 45 minutes into it I started to get discouraged. This thing was like homework. I just wanted to put it away and say that alright	 I saw half of it. That's good enough. But no. If I sat through Cheerleader Ninjas	 I could sit throughout this.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this thing a 1 is for two points: 1) I love Madsen. I know it's not fair. But it's great seeing the opening title ""Introducing Michael Madsen"". Sue me. 2) Some of the Dialogue is so bad that it's classic. I'll stick some quotes at the end of this so you can enjoy them too.<br /><br />That's about it. To wrap it up 	this thing is a piece of crap that should stay flushed with the rest of the turds. But hey! Look! Michael Madsen! (See also TILT	 EXECUTIVE TARGET	 MY BOSS'S DAUGHTER	 etc). Now I've gotta rewatch Reservoir Dogs and watch Madsen torture a cop to get my respect back for him. See ya	 Kids.<br /><br />""This stuff's gonna make me go blind	 but I'm gonna drink it anyway"" - Madsen's first taste of cheap alcohol<br /><br />""I don't understand! Everything seems so beautiful!"" - Madsen walking outside after confessing to God<br /><br />""I'm going downtown later and pick up a bible and I'm gonna get a haircut too"" - Madsen after converting at the dinner table	 because Satan lives in your hair"	0.0
"This was among the STUPIDEST and PREACHIEST of the anti-nuke films out of the 1980s.<br /><br />The idea that a kid and a basketball star could ""change the world"" is pretty far-fetched	 given how many ""children's peace marches"" and ""celebrity protests"" there were and ARE.<br /><br />But the idea that the Soviet Union would agree to a TOTAL nuclear disarmament	 because some apparatchik kids learned of a ""silent protest"" in the West	 is ludicrous.<br /><br />What ended the Cold War?

"This is by far the worst film I have seen in my entire life. The acting is poor and the storyline is almost incomprehensible. Whether or not you like lightships or any ships for that matter is irrelevant. As for special effects the film has none. The whole film crew were probably on the boat out in rough seas rather than in a studio and when some of the men are ""stabbed"" (if you can even call it that) their reactions are totally unreal. The guns are more quiet than a mute. How this film could have one two awards puts serious questions to the state of the human mind. Well thats about it. This review is probably more fun to read than the film is to watch. If anyone is considering watching it or buying it I would seriously advise you against it for obvious reasons. I have said that it includes a spoiler. If the fact that some people get stabbed and a gun gets fired is a plot giveaway. I suppose it is because they are the only good parts of the film."	0.0
"First week of May	 every year brings back the memories of the holocaust	 through movies on televisions. Among many movies they showed	 this was the one I had not seen.<br /><br />The story is about Hilter's life and how he came to power. It starts with his childhood and ends with his holding the top most position of power in Germany.<br /><br />The movie was earlier presented as a TV series and later converted into a movie format. Scottish actor Robert Carlyle plays Adolf Hitler with great guts	 conviction and flare to give a real portrayal of this man.<br /><br />It is a good screenplay and narrative	 that educates the audiences on the main events that lead Hitler into power	 and also tries to show the probable psychological make up of Hitler. The movie is a biased viewpoint of the director Christian Duguay  who shows Hitler as a one-track	 menacing	 angry	 and shouting person  who had such a strong hold on the Germans and people around him. Hitler is not shown as someone having charishma and attraction	 and there the movie fails to convince Hitler's portrayal.<br /><br />Even though the venture was for TV	 all the ingredients of production are first class and at par with any main stream movie. The production value	 sets	 costumes	 etc. were perfect.<br /><br />There is a lot of criticism of this movie	 in the authenticity about the historic events that is presented. But still the movie is gripping	 every engaging and entertaining. Robert Carlyle overpowers and dominates the screen as no one else does. He is amazingly good  brilliant! I would have liked a more balanced view of Hitler's life	 because I think	 Hitler was able to bring out the dormant feelings of million of Germans and it is not only him who should be blamed for the holocaust. As I have told several times	 that  very sadly - our society loves to garland or prosecute one person	 as a representative of the society's good or evil respectively."	1.0
"First of all	 this film can be divided into three segments. A promising opening	 with the ambushing of some cavalry by the Cheyenne. This is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section	 with the totally miscast Candice Bergen and ""Soldier Blue"" traveling together to reach the safety of an Army garrison. Miss Bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth	 and looks like she just walked out of a 1970s Jack Nicholson movie. I mean she maintains zero interest	 with zero believability. The third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an Indian village. This is so obviously overdone to lay on the anti-war propaganda	 that it comes across as simply long	 outrageous	 and contrived. Not recommended. - MERK................................

"FULL OF SPOILERS.<br /><br />This is a pretty fast and enjoyable crime thriller based on Ira Levin's play about two gay playwrights (Caine and Reeve) that plot the murder of one's rich wife (Cannon) to get the property and the insurance. The plot succeeds but Christopher Reeve as the younger and less established of the two writers decides to make a play out of the actual murder -- with only slight changes in the details. Reeve allows that Easthampton	 Long Island	 can become Southampton	 Long Island	 in the script	 for instance. The rest of the play's plot is a dead giveaway and to tell the truth Reeve doesn't mind a little gossip or even an inquiry into Cannon's apparently accidental death. It will boost the revenues and his own Warhol quotient.<br /><br />Michael Caine is Sidney Bruhl	 the megabucks-making playwright whose last four productions bombed and who would like nothing more than to quietly get back to working on a new play	 perhaps with Reeve's input	 that would redeem his reputation. He cannot permit Reeve's scandalous play-a-clef to be produced. So -- what else? -- he tries to murder him. In the end they wind up killing one another	 the manuscript is appropriated by their neighbor	 the psychic Helga Tensdoorp	 and she makes a million bucks selling it to Broadway.<br /><br />It's a lot of fun for a number of reasons. One is the production design. That multi-roomed	 multi-storied house with the big windmill atop	 situated on nine of what must be the most valuable acres on earth (Easthampton!) would be a splendid set of digs anywhere. You wouldn't be able to afford a pup tent in Easthamptom. The house is not overly large or baroque in its decor. It's just magnificently modest	 although it's a little tidy for my tastes	 the kind of house that's so clean you're afraid to step on the thick carpet for fear of leaving the imprint of a foot.<br /><br />Next	 the acting could hardly be improved upon. Caine	 Cannon	 and Fred Jones are superb. Dyan Cannon gives a pitch-perfect performance as the anxious wife whose slacks are so tight they look as if they'd been sprayed on	 which is okay given her assets. Even Reeve	 whose talent was limited	 seems to find a comfortable niche in his role of affable but psychopathic murderer. Irene Worth	 as the psychic neighbor Helga	 was in some way hard to define	 a mistake. Granted she -- or someone like her -- was necessary to the plot	 but	 my God	 what an offensive snoop her character is	 going around and claiming	 ""I feel pain in zis woom!"" I suppose in order to make her a little more interesting	 she's got up in sweats and a goofy looking cap with bicycle reflectors on it. Still	 she's a nuisance from beginning to end.<br /><br />You have to love Ira Levin's bitchy dialog. The distraught Caine begs Reeve to tell him why he wrote the tell-all play. ""Because it's THERE	 Sidney!"" says Reeve	 and Caine shouts	 ""That's MOUNTAINS	 not PLAYS! Plays aren't there until some ***hole WRITES them!"" Great too is Caine's call to the police after his wife drops dead of fright	 as planned. He works himself up into a torrent of sobs	 barely able to speak	 as he reports the incident and implores that an ambulance be sent immediately. When he hangs up	 his face assumes its usual placid expression	 he blows his nose into his handkerchief	 and walks away	 all business again.<br /><br />The climax	 though suitably ironic	 is confusing and noisy and full of artifice	 lacking in the wicked charm that Levin and Lumet brought to the earlier scenes. The score is mostly made up of light-hearted riffs on the harpsichord	 neatly fitting into the film.<br /><br />You'll probably enjoy it."	1.0
"This was a favorite of my childhood - I can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time. Now that I'm grown up and have a kid of my own	 I wanted to introduce him to this classic movie. We watched it last Friday	 and he liked it. During Abu's fight with the giant spider	 my son's hand crept over and took hold of mine - he was genuinely scared. ""Is he gonna beat the spider	 Poppa?"" Just watch	 you'll see. He has no historical frame of reference to speak of (eight years old)	 so Bagdad under the grandson of Haroun al-Raschid might as well be Oz under Ozma.<br /><br />I think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring-do were perpetrated by the boy-thief	 and not the grown-up king. In fact	 if you deconstruct the film's narrative a bit	 the king is the thief's sidekick	 not the hero at all - which must be very satisfying to imaginative	 adventurous young boys. <br /><br />It's definitely a period piece - I suspect that by the time he's eleven or twelve	 my son will find it 'corny' or whatever word the next generation will be using by then. The love story is barely one-dimensional - as a cynical friend commented	 ""Why does Ahmad love the Princess? Because the narrative demands it."" The willingness of Abu to put himself in jeopardy (repeatedly) for the clueless	 love-struck deposed king is equally improbable. But to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses	 fifty-foot genies and the Temple of the All-Seeing Eye would be fatuous in the extreme.

George Clooney also was involved with this movie as a producer	 along with Steven Soderbergh	 which shows that they really believed in this project. In potential this also seems like a fine and entertaining project	 that is in the same line with movie-remakes such as ""Ocean's Eleven"" and ""The Italian Job"" but somehow this movie is only halve successful	 or at least it isn't as good as it could had been.<br /><br />The movie its characters are all being played by some fine well known actors but a shame is that the characters are not really given enough room to develop. Even though in their potential they could had turned into fun and enjoyable characters	 they are now only characters that mildly entertain because mostly of some of the more quirky sequences that are in the movie. The fact that they are being played doesn't change much to this	 even though they prevent their characters from ever becoming a total bore or perhaps even annoying	 or anything like that at all.<br /><br />It's of course due to the writing that the characters aren't used to their full potential. I can only assume that the original Italian movie ""I Soliti ignoti"" works out much better than this movie does. The movie relies too much on its simple story and predictable way of storytelling.<br /><br />Nevertheless the movie is simply still a very fun one to watch maybe because of that very same simplicity. It's an harmless little caper movie	 in which you simply shouldn't to worry much about the story. In that regard ""Welcome to Collinwood"" is still a movie that works out and simply serves its purpose well.<br /><br />It's a movie that you won't regret watching once you've finished it but it also is a movie you can really easily do without ever seeing.<br /><br />7/10"	1.0
"First off...with names like Fred Olen Ray	 Brinke Stevens and Jan-Michael Vincent	 plus distributors like ""Rhino"" and ""Troma"" on the video box	 you know what you're getting into with this one. B movie mania! If you're actually expecting to see a thriller ""based on Edgar Allan Poe	"" then forget it and head straight for the excellent series of Roger Corman 60s Poe films. This is pure	 unadulterated sleaze (with just a pedestrian attempt at a plot similar to ""The Premature Burial"")	 complete with lots of R-rated	 ready-for-video sex and nudity. However	 it's certainly entertaining and fun in a slipshod kind of way...<br /><br />Brinke (who has three nude scenes in the first 30 minutes) plays rich	 traumatized	 insomniac housewife Victoria Monroe	 whose fear of being prematurely entombed stems from her belief that the same fate befell her father (Hoke Howell). Her worthless husband Terry (Jay Richardson) has racked up some serious gambling debt (owed to a gangster played by Robert Quarry) and	 with help from his kinky	 blonde	 European-accented sexpot secretary Lisa (Delia Sheppard) plots to do away with Brinke for her money. Name-value actress Karen Black drops in briefly wearing a blonde wig as a hypnotist (she's way too talented to be playing an insignificant role like this)	 50s sci-fi/horror star Robert Clarke plays a doctor and family friend and Michael Berryman shows up for a decent nightmare sequence performing an autopsy on a still-living Vicki. Jan-Michael Vincent mostly sits outside a house in his car making goo-goo eyes as Brinke enters and exits the home.<br /><br />The kill-a-spouse-for-the-inheritance plot has been done a million times before	 the ending is an unintentional laugh riot (concluding with a direct rip-off of the Zuni Fetish Doll segment in TRILOGY OF TERROR) and whoever created the awful stabbed face and decapitated head FX for this release needs to sharpen up on their skills a bit. Brinke does a decent job making her character somewhat sympathetic	 but the biggest surprise of all is how good former Penthouse Pet Delia Sheppard is in her role. She stole every scene she was in and easily gave the standout performance here."	0.0
"The film begins with a bunch of kids in reform school and focuses on a kid named 'Gabe'	 who has apparently worked hard to earn his parole. Gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to make a fresh start and soon Gabe meets up with the Dead End Kids. The Kids in this film are little punks	 but they are much less antisocial than they'd been in other previous films and down deep	 they are well-meaning punks. However	 in this neighborhood there are also some criminals who are perpetrating insurance fraud through arson and see Gabe as a convenient scapegoat--after all	 he'd been to reform school and no one would believe he was innocent once he was framed. So	 when Gabe is about ready to be sent back to ""The Big House""	 it's up to the rest of the gang to save him and expose the real crooks.<br /><br />The ""Dead End Kids"" appeared in several Warner Brothers films in the late 1930s and the films were generally very good (particularly ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES). However	 after the boys' contracts expired	 they went on to Monogram Studios and the films	 to put it charitably	 were very weak and formulaic--with Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey being pretty much the whole show and the group being renamed ""The Bowery Boys"". Because ANGELS WASH THEIR FACES had the excellent writing and production values AND Hall and Gorcey were not constantly mugging for the camera	 it's a pretty good film--and almost earns a score of 7 (it's REAL close). In fact	 while this isn't a great film aesthetically	 it's sure a lot of fun to watch	 so I will give it a 7! Sure	 it was a tad hokey-particularly towards the end when the kids take the law into their own hands and Reagan ignores the Bill of Rights--but it was also quite entertaining. The Dead End Kids are doing their best performances and Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan provided excellent support. Sure	 this part of the film was illogical and impossible but somehow it was still funny and rather charming--so if you can suspend disbelief	 it works well."	1.0

"I desperately want to give this movie a 10...I really do. Some movies	 especially horror movies are so budget that they are good. A wise-cracking ninja scarecrow who can implement corn cobs as lethal weaponry...definitely fits this 'budget to brilliance' system. The depth of the movie is definitely its strong point and the twists and turns it implements	 keeping the audience at the edge of their seats really drives the creepy...ninja... puberty-stricken... pre-thirty year old student...non-cowboy drawing...wise-cracking...son-of-a-bitch scarecrow into the limelight as the creepiest horror icon of the year. All I can really say is	 'can you dig it' and recommend watching movies such as Frankenfish if you enjoy this sort of hilarious horror.<br /><br />(WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY SMOKING!?'"	0.0
"This	 the finest achievement from Georg Wilhelm Pabst's Social Realism period is based upon a tragedy in early 1906 that claimed the lives of nearly 1100 French miners as a coal dust explosion deep in mines at Courrieres in northern France took place after a fire had smouldered for three weeks	 eventually releasing deadly pit gas that brought about the fatalities. Estimable designer Erno Metzner creates stark sets that simulate the tragedy	 providing a perception of reality	 augmented by matchless sound editing	 with the only music being produced by integral orchestras during the beginning and ending portions of a work for which aural effects possess equal importance with the eminent director's fascinating visual compositions. Pabst's manner of ""invisible editing"" that segues action from shot to shot through movements of players proves to be smoothly integrated within this landmark film that also showcases sublime cinematography utilizing cameras mounted upon vehicles	 enabling the director to shift amid scenes without having a necessity of cutting. Although the work's cardinal theme relates to Socialist dogma	 the unforgettable power of this film is held in its details	 born of Pabst's nonpareil skill at weaving numerous plot lines into a cinema tapestry that stirs one to admiration for German rescue squads of whom their Fatherland is greatly proud while no less despairing of disastrous losses to the families of French victims; certainly	 a seminal triumph fully as stimulating today to a cineaste as it was at the time of its first release."	1.0
"Beverly garland was born in the wrong time. She was an actress ahead of her time	 bringing power and grace to even such lame flicks as the Corman films she starred in. In Gunslinger	 she's the town sheriff's wife. He gets offed	 so she takes over his job to pursue his killers. She's better than the material she's working with	 by far. The movie is gray	 stilted	 and mostly boring. There's some(unintentional)humor with the tire tracks everywhere	 people running behind one building to emerge suddenly in front of another (I've heard of false fronts	 but this is ridiculous!)	 and the truly stupid plot line of the newly widowed sheriff falling in love with the guy hired to kill her. Even if she hadn't loved her husband	 it had only been something like a week or two since he'd died! And she ends up shooting the guy to death in the end	 anyway. No luck with men	 this one.<br /><br />The villain of the piece is another woman	 the saloon owner. She's scheming to buy up a bunch of land just in case the railroad goes through and makes her rich. Her plan of action if it doesn't is pretty lame-she'll just steal as much from the town as she can and skedaddle. Hell	 it's just her and her hired gun at the end against an entire town. Are you telling me these people aren't armed? Look what happened in real towns of the Old West when bank robbers came in to rob the bank	 then were cut down in a hail of bullets by the armed and dangerous town folk.<br /><br />There'a a lot of pointless talking and riding around	 interspersed with a few lame shoot outs. The ending is as grim as usual in a Corman flick	 although thank goodness it lacks the moral proselytizing at the end that was in It Conquered the World. The sheriff turns over her badge to Sam Bass and rides off into the sunset	 although the movie was so gray that you never saw the sun."	0.0

"I usually read reviews before I watch a movie. Guess what	 I didn't do that before watching TLB	 and I have to say I was very surprised to see the above average rating at IMDb. I found it to have a total lack of story. You just get dropped into it (and	 sadly	 not in the way Saving Private Ryan dropped us into the movie)	 and it also has a sudden end	 which was very unsatisfying for me.<br /><br />I have to admit	 the wounded soldiers looked pretty realistic to me	 especially with the low budget in mind. But prepare yourself to have a laugh... Some guys are being tossed through the air after an explosion as if they are Olympic gymnasts. A mid-air corkscrew or somersault during WW I is a bit too much for me	 especially when it's performed countless times during the movie...<br /><br />But the parts that really got me laughing until I almost cried were the scenes containing close combat. The screaming and shouting German voices...unbelievably funny. It seems as if they are spoken by one single actor / voice performer	 because they all sound exactly the same	 and it just sounds like a 'typical' German voice.<br /><br />I would absolutely NOT recommend this movie to anyone	 except to people who just want to have some laughs because of the sad and corny quality of it."	0.0
"The movie is actually too slow. There are some nice images but it cannot outweigh the fact that the movie is in fact boring. You see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more. It may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isn't fun at all. Though you laugh several times but it's really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun. To disturb the boredom director tries to put few movie video-clips into the movie. They are really colorful clips of absurd songs maybe from the 50's but it's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it's really sad. Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something	 that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporates and that's it. Beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music. The director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost. Personally I cannot recommend the movie. I believe that art is something that shouldn't be boring. During the projection there was yawning all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review."	0.0
"Being a fan of Billy Bob Thornton	 and the diversity of his skills	 I noticed this movie listed	 and was surprised I hadn't heard of it.<br /><br />I'd traveled more than usual during both the period it was being filmed in 2000	 and when it hit theaters more than 2-1/2 years later (that passage of time is the first clue all was not well with the production).<br /><br />Now Patrick Swayze can't act for sour apples	 but Thornton has more than enough ability to make-up for the difference between them. And Charlize Theron is someone whom it would be a pleasure to see	 even if it showed her watching paint dry.<br /><br />Being curious	 I checked this site's production info. It made a whopping < $600 per screen its opening weekend	 and just over $400 each	 after its month's theater run in latter 2002. Overall gross was $261K	 which I'd doubt could cover cast and crew's hotel and food for a week on location.<br /><br />The story is pretty benign	 and even the use of the usually interesting locale of Reno is as dull as the rest of the goings-on.<br /><br />It's something like several SNL bits all pieced together	 none individually too great at all	 and the overall presentation even worse.<br /><br />Whatever	 the expenses for this production had to be considerable - even if all worked for less than their usual fees - so the one thing which made it a barely tolerable opus was the quality of the filming and Billy Bob's present (albeit understandably somewhat laconic here 	 compared with his usual work.<br /><br />Think of the three superb	 totally diverse characters he portrayed in ""Sling Blade	"" ""Bandits"" and ""Bad Santa	"" and you know he realized this work was below standard	 long before the viewers had the opportunity to confirm this. One star for him	 even here	 and one because production was better than	 say	 the typical ""Lifetime"" flick."	0.0
"An original uncensored print of this amazing film was discovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress	 and has been shown in a few specialized theaters around the world in 2005. According to current reviews that I've found online	 the original has all of the nastiest dialog and innuendos intact; they were later either removed or completely re-shot by the studio prior to initial release	 in order to pass the New York state censors. I have also read that a DVD is ""expected in 2006"" and one can only hope! If we're really luckily	 it will include comparisons between the 2 versions. Note that the released censored version was originally available on Laserdisc	 which I have seen. Stanwyck rules!"	1.0
"For two of the funniest comedians	 the movie was awful. Fast forwarded it and never got any better! Waste of time and waste of money! Tina Fey is such a great writer	 I thought that she would be so great in the comedy. The previews were so great	 but they only showed the best parts of the movie. My husband even thought that for a chick flick	 it sucked. What is up with that. Movie was very slow ans boring. I will not recommend it to anyone at this time. I would like my money back for this one! BOO from us here in Arizona. Thanks but no thanks. Who does this kind of stupid stuff to make people think that you are pregnant. I thought that it was going to be so funny	 I have had my own children and I have helped others have children. It could have been more along the lines of reality."	0.0
"Usually I love Lesbian movies even when they are not very good. I'm biased	 I guess! <br /><br />But this one is just the pits. Yes	 the scenery and the buildings are beautiful	 and there is a brief but beautiful erotic interlude	 but otherwise this movie is just a complete waste of time. Annamarie alternates between sulking and getting high/stoned/passing out on whatever drug or booze is handy	 and Ella inexplicably puts up with this abominable behavior through the entire movie. At no time are we given any insight into why this is so	 or even why Annamarie is so depressed and withdrawn.<br /><br />If there had at least been some kind of closure in the (potentially romantic? we don't even know!) relationship between the two	 there might have been some kind of satisfaction. But although Annamarie at one point asks Ella ""why do you love me?"" Ella doesn't even acknowledge this. It's never really clear whether this is anything more than an (ill-behaved) Lesbian on a boring road trip with a straight woman.<br /><br />Even the interactions between the two women and the local people they meet on the journey	 which could have been lively and informative	 are instead flat	 tedious and mostly incomprehensible.<br /><br />There is one good joke in the movie	 although I'm sure it was unintentional. The women travel in a two-seat Ford coupe with a middling sized trunk. Yet when they set up camp	 they have an enormous tent	 cots	 sleeping gear	 and even a table	 chair	 and typewriter! On top of that	 when they board a ferry	 we see piles of luggage	 presumably theirs	 presumably also carried in the little Ford's trunk! <br /><br />And through the entire film	 we never see one gas station	 or anywhere that looks like it would actually have any place to buy gasoline. Mostly they travel through endless miles of desolate desert. So where did they get fuel?<br /><br />There may not be too many Lesbian films out there	 good or bad	 but there are plenty that are better than this	 and very few that are worse. Leave this one in the rack."	0.0

"Lesbian vampire film about a couple on holiday who are staying on the grounds of what they think is an empty manor house but is really being used as a pair of lesbian vampires. As the vampires bring in the occasional victim the couple go about their business until the two groups come crashing together.<br /><br />Great looking film with two very sexy women as the vampires there is nothing beyond the eye candy that they provide to recommend this cult film. Yes its a sexy vampire story. No it is not remotely interesting beyond the women. To be honest there is a reason that I've been seeing stills of this film in horror books and magazines it looks great	 but other than that...<br /><br />For those who want to see sexy vampires only."	0.0
"In what is arguably the best outdoor adventure film of all time	 four city guys confront nature's wrath	 in a story of survival. The setting is backwoods Georgia	 with its forests	 mountains	 and wild rivers.<br /><br />The director	 John Boorman	 chose to use local people	 not actors	 to portray secondary characters. These locals imbue the film with a depth of characterization unequaled in film history. No central casting ""actors"" could ever come close to these people's remarkable faces	 voices	 or actions. I don't recall a film wherein the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful. As much as anything else	 it is this gritty realism that makes this film so amazing.<br /><br />Another strength is the film's theme. Nature	 in the wild	 can be violent. How appropriate that the setting should be the American South. Very few places in the U.S. are	 or have been	 as violent as redneck country. In a story about Darwinian survival of the fittest	 the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature	 not separate from it.<br /><br />""Deliverance"" is very much a product of its time when	 unlike today	 Americans expressed concern over a vanishing wilderness. The film's magnificent scenery	 the sounds of birds	 frogs	 crickets	 and the roar of the river rapids	 combined with the absence of civilization	 all convey an environmental message. And that is another strength of the film.<br /><br />At an entertainment level	 the tension gradually escalates	 as the plot proceeds. Not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme	 and then never lets up	 not until the final credits roll. Very few films can sustain that level of intensity over such a long span of plot.<br /><br />Finally	 the film's technical quality is topnotch. Direction and editing are flawless. Cinematography is excellent. Dialogue is interesting. And the acting is terrific. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Ned Beatty is perfectly cast and does a fine job. And Jon Voight should have been nominated for an Oscar. If there is a weak link in the film	 it is the music	 which strikes me as timid.<br /><br />Overall	 ""Deliverance"" almost certainly will appeal to viewers who like outdoor adventure. Even for those who don't	 the gritty characterizations	 the acting	 and the plot tension are reasons enough to watch this film	 one of the finest in cinema history."	1.0
"Having just seen the A Perfect Spy mini series in one go	 one can do nothing but doff one's hat - a pure masterpiece	 which compared to the other Le Carré minis about Smiley	 has quite different qualities.<br /><br />In the minis about Smiley	 it is Alex Guiness	 as Smiley	 who steals the show - the rest of the actors just support him	 one can say.<br /><br />Here it is ensemble and story that's important	 as the lead actor	 played excellently by Peter Egan in the final episodes	 isn't charismatic at all. <br /><br />Egan just plays a guy called Magnus Pym	 who by lying	 being devious and telling people what they like to hear	 is very well liked by everyone	 big and small. The only one who seems to understand his inner self is Alex	 his Czech handler.<br /><br />Never have the machinery behind a spy	 and/or traitor	 been told better! After having followed his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor. His ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him into 'a perfect spy'	 as his Czech handler calls him. <br /><br />And	 by following his life	 we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path	 once you've veered off it. He trundles on	 even if he never get anything economic out of it	 except promotion by his MI5 spy masters. Everyone's happy	 as long as the flow of faked information continues! <br /><br />Magnus's father	 played wonderfully by Ray McAnally	 is a no-good con-man	 who always dreams up schemes to con people out of their money. In later years it is his son who has to bail him out	 again and again. But by the example set by his dad and uncle	 who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison	 and his mom is sent off to an asylum	 Magnus quickly learns early that lying is the way of surviving	 not telling the truth. At first he overdoes it a bit	 but quickly learn to tell the right lies	 and to be constant	 not changing the stories from time to time that he tell those who want to listen about himself and his dad.<br /><br />His Czech handler Alex	 expertly played by Rüdiger Weigang	 creates	 with the help of Magnus	 a network of non-existing informants	 which supplies the British MI5 with fake information for years	 and years	 just as the British did with the German spies that were active in the UK before and during the war - they kept on sending fake information to Das Vaterland long after the agents themselves had been turned	 liquidated or simply been replaced by MI5 men.<br /><br />The young lads who play Magnus in younger years does it wonderfully	 and most of them are more charismatic than the older	 little more cynic	 and tired	 Pym	 played by Egan. But you buy the difference easily	 as that is often the way we change through life	 from enthusiasm to sorrow	 or indifference.<br /><br />Indeed well worth the money!"	1.0
"Maria Bello doesn't seem to care what people think of her choices in movie roles. Again she chooses a very difficult and not popular movie to star in. Maybe she needs those movies	 to get off the sugar coated (aka ""Hollywood"") ones she does here and then (Coyote Ugly and of course Mummy 3).<br /><br />While I think fails to achieve what it sets out to do (I won't spoil that)	 Maria Bello is as great as in her other independent/small movies she stars in. It's her performance that elevates this movie. This combined with the strange subject matter almost did the trick for me. But in the end (and even if I try to overlook some flaws	 like bad pacing and dramaturgy)	 the movie is still too long"	0.0

Why did the ""Jeep"" (Chevy Blazer??) stop running from being hit with a bat? Why did they hit the ""Jeep""(Chevy Blazer?????) with the bat in the first place instead of cracking the bum's skull?

"I'm a huge classic film buff	 but am just getting in to silent movies. A lot of silent films don't hold my attention	 but Show People is a notable exception.<br /><br />Marion Davies and William Haines are simply wonderful in this picture.

The movie captured my attention immediately and I actually forgot that it was a silent film. (I know that doesn't make much sense	 but that's what happened.) The actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are necessary.<br /><br />Show People is a perfect introduction to silent films. It is a fast paced	 interesting film with two of the silent era's best stars. Add in the satire of Hollywood and Show People should be on the 'must see' list for all classic film buffs."	1.0
"obviously has some talent attached	 Maria Bello is always great. but this is just a dreary wast of time	 portraying every character as someone to be loathed and exploited so someone could make a movie out of an 'interesting' story. well	 i hope they got it out of their systems. unfortunately for the audience	 there is no insight	 no sensitivity	 no context	 and really no humanity. which would all be fine	 except it has no humor	 no horror	 no context	 and nothing constructive to say about the story it's trying to tell. bad things happen	 you sit and watch it	 you don't care	 so what? 99% of the time	 the words 'based on a true story' constitute an unintentional warning to the audience. it means the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some events they heard about somewhere	 so they just throw them up on the screen and expect the 'true' nature of the story to make the audience feel something without the filmmakers having to do any of the work. i hope they had a great time making this movie. it stinks on ice."	0.0
"On rare occasions a film comes along that has the power to expand the mind	 warm the heart and touch the very soul. ""LOU"" is such a film.

Her as if for the first time again.<br /><br />""LOU"" is a magical piece designed to send you back to the moment at which all of your dramas started taking place. It does this while being relentlessly entertaining. Bret Carr's acting and pacing as a director do not let you look away from the screen.

When the epiphany hits during the brilliant climax	 I saw my wife in tears for the second time.<br /><br />As a life coach	 I facilitate individual growth and transformation	 and this film is a ""must see"" for life coaches and anyone seeking their own personal growth and transformation.

"This movie was two and a quarter excruciating hours. Someone please tell me what the point was?<br /><br />I mean	 I understand the historical setting. It's supposed to be about a ragtag group of Confederate bushwhackers (terrorists?) on the Missouri-Kansas frontier	 taking revenge against all northern sympathizers and abolitionists during the U.S. Civil War. But aside from gratuitous violence there wasn't really much of a point to this movie. Perhaps it was a political statement? That war is really nothing much more than gratuitous violence? If that was the point it was done quite well	 but I don't think that was the point. I think the producers really thought they were making a worthwhile movie here	 but as far as I was concerned there was a complete lack of any plot. It seemed like I was watching a paperback novel come to life	 with the characters looking like what you would see on the covers of such novels.<br /><br />This movie should be burned along with some of the towns this gang torched!"	0.0
"""Raising Victor Vargas"" is one of those light	 family movies that you can watch and do the N.Y. Times crossword puzzle at the same time. And if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a Corona	 you don't have to ""Pause"" the DVD. Just let it roll	 'cause you won't be missing anything really important. No twists	 turns	 or tension. It's not really an ethnic movie	 it's a movie about a poor	 struggling immigrant family that happens to be Latino. They could have been any ethnic group. It made very little difference. I've seen it all a zillion times before. Just plug in a Jewish family	 an Italian family	 a Black family	 or an Irish family. Just the accents and names were different. If the Vargas family was named Bush or Clinton and were Presbyterians	 the movie would have been a total snooze. <br /><br />It's funny that the critics here couldn't get the locale straight. Some said it was Spanish Harlem. Some the Bronx	 and another Brooklyn. As a life-long New Yorker	 I vote for the Lower East Side. And it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other Latinos. They lived in an insulated/isolated little enclave. Some interaction with non-Latinos might have created some excitement	 interest	 or tension. Remember West Side Story?<br /><br />And now for the oft-criticized cinematography. I don't know if it was my TV or what	 but all the indoor shots looked very ORANGE to me. The apt	 the furniture	 and the faces were all ORANGE. What was that supposed to mean? And the apt. did look pretty cramped to me. Somebody here mentioned that the old apt's/tenements had very big rooms. Well	 maybe 50 years ago. What landlords have done is to break up one big apt into 2 or 3 very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them. <br /><br />And another annoying thing ....This is the second family movie I've seen and criticized this week that featured a teenage boy ""jerking off"". Is this private sex act necessary for us to watch? Please spare me! What's up with these directors? <br /><br />So ""Victor Vargas"" is a pleasant little movie. It was nice for a change to see young Latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents	 which they did. But the writers let them down	 giving them a flat	 unspectacular script to work with. Enjoy the show	 but keep your fingers near the ""fast forward"" button."	0.0
"Given the history of the director of this movie	 it is hard to believe that this was such a painfully bad movie to sit through.

I have not read the book that this is based upon	 nor do I know if it highly rated or appreciated	 but I have read ""Captain Correlli's Mandolin"" and given how poorly that was adapted for screen and how bad this movie was	 I can only presume that something similar has happened here. The acting wasn't bad albeit that there were a couple-too-many raised eyebrows from Farrell. Honestly	 I can't believed how little I cared for any character in this movie. Situations play out on the screen in an empty sequence of nothingness. Donald Sutherland's part comprises a few scenes where he opens a door	 says something and closes it again. I kept looking at my watch when I wasn't cringing at the dialogue on the screen. I have never walked out on a movie but I was tempted to start during this. I gave this movie a score of '2' for reasons which seem horrendously shallow to me but these are the best things that I can say about this movie. The first is that I really enjoyed the all-too-short earthquake scene and the second is that Salma Hayek got naked and looked beautiful. I can say little else positive about this movie. Don't ask the dust anything	 it can't talk!"	0.0
"Jungle Fever is too highly stylized	 stereotyped	 and comes across as essentially dishonest. Wesley Snipes was wrong for the lead and there was no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra. Even though there's plenty of talent in this movie	 it's mostly wasted because the parts are reduced to little more than decorative cameos. Also	 instead of simply showing racism for the ugly and stupid thing it is	 Spike Lee chooses to wave it around like a flag in a most whining and irritating manner. I made it through most of the film but I couldn't quite finish it	 and that	 for me	 rarely happens."	0.0
"By far the worst movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this turkey. I have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled ""The Treasure"" but was changed to ""Sharks' Treasure"" in order to take advantage of the excitement created by ""Jaws"". I think sharks were in one scene of this movie; the fact that they happened to be included in this ""thriller"" was supposed to sell tickets. Didn't work. Anytime something ""good"" happens in the movie	 the ship's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made. Gee	 do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor? Could they have made it any more obvious? The only time anyone should break out the beer is if they make it through this thing. That's cause enough for celebration."	0.0
"As a knowledgeable fan I recommend this film as faithful to the facts and well acted. As an 11 year old living in Istanbul I heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream. I thought hmmmm	 if girls like them	 they must be crap. My only records until then were Haley Mills	 The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson. Soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in Ismir I heard a song (which I later learned was 'Love Me Do') and was floored by the difference between it and every song I had ever heard until then. When I heard the 'Meet The Beatles' album of my older brother I was hooked for life. Having read the definitive book of their beginnings (by Davis) I was surprised that this movie followed the facts very well with the exception of leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use (it did touch on the use of methadrine/dexadrine). >"	1.0
"""Hey Babu Riba"" is a film about a young woman	 Mariana (nicknamed ""Esther"" after a famous American movie star)	 and four young men	 Glenn	 Sacha	 Kicha	 and Pop	 all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 Belgrade	 Yugoslavia. The five are committed friends and crazy about jazz	 blue jeans	 or anything American it seems.<br /><br />The very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant	 and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties. In the wake of changing communist politics	 they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made).<br /><br />I enjoyed the film with some reservations. The subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially in the beginning	 there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all. Perhaps the conversational pace required it	 but I couldn't always both read the text and absorb the scene	 which caused me to not always understand which character was involved. I watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend	 and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative.<br /><br />This Yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers' sense of invulnerability	 idealism	 and strong and loyal bonds to each other. There is a main flashforward	 and it was intriguing	 keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast	 and what had actually happened.<br /><br />I would rate it 7 out of 10	 and would like to see other films by the director	 Jovan Acin (1941-1991)."	1.0
"But this movie was a bore. The history part was fine but the musical part was not. Not one song I cared about and no soundtrack to be heard.<br /><br />If Sweet Jesus"" was suppose to be comic relief it never work. If John Adams was suppose to be the obnoxious annoying one	 the rest of them were trying to overthrow him in every scene.<br /><br />Hancock and Jefferson were the only bearable characters in the whole movie.<br /><br />The historical quotes and the debate about slavery in their historical context were interesting enough but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a musical.<br /><br />Shouldn't you be humming the songs after a musical	 except for a few chirps	 nothing else was worth the breath."	0.0
"Along with Darkwing Duck this is unfairly cancelled. Disney has been in decline since Tarzan and we need a show like this to get Disney back on track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for the voices of Louis and Baloo (sounds familiar?) The theme theme tune is also catchy. Out of all the villains	 which are all great on their own merits	 Tony Jay stands out as Shere Kahn. Louis and Baloo actually sound very similar to the voice overs in the Jungle Book	 which isn't a bad thing at all. As a matter of fact	 it's quite inspirational! The animation was spot on	 and the script had plenty of wit that has been severely lacking in animations for years. PLEASE BRING THIS SHOW BACK! 9/10. Bethany Cox"	1.0
"This film plays really well with an audience. Especially once the chase begins. Plus	 Trevor Howard with his sensible	 smart charms and Jean Simmons with her innocent demeanor and piercing eyes are terrific together.<br /><br />The film starts as a psychological drama but after the murder it segues into a chase thriller as the two leads head for the border. Some may think the chase is superfluous but actually the chase is essential because it aids in clearing the mind of the Jean Simmons character by getting her out of the oppressive household	 plus it helps bring out the real killer - who is suddenly put into such a position that they have to finish the job. The killer rightly believed that once the Simmons character was arrested she would be put away. And it is true that her lack of control in the household - as well as evidence pointing her way - there is no way she would have gotten out of the murder charge. The chase that ensues helps bring out the truth.<br /><br />This is an entertaining film. Seek it out if you can find it."	1.0
"The title song for this movie ...........is the greatest free spirited ballad ever written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /><br />I first saw this movie back in 1978-79 when I first subscribed to cable. In 1979 cable was just starting to become common place in homes. (or at least that when it was becoming common here in Missouri).<br /><br />This might very well be the first movie I ever watched on the pay channel called ""The Movie Channel"" - which was called ""The Star Channel"" back then	 they changed the name to ""The Movie Channel"" in the early 1980's........I received a free month of ""The Star Channel"" with my new cable subscription. ""The Van"" was one of the movies that was in heavy rotation on that network at that time.<br /><br />I remember watching this movie back then	 and thinking it was a typical teen flick(along the same lines as other medium budget teen flicks) ...the ones where the plot revolves around nudity and parties.<br /><br />I totally forgot that this movie even existed until I recently seen this movie again after having not seeing it for decades( I found a copy of it on DVD for sale in cheap bin) I recognized it	 and bought it for a mere $4.99.<br /><br />Seems like I had remembered this film being much better that it was(is). However watching it back then was a different experience than watching now(30+ years later).<br /><br />It was fun to see the kids listing to rock n roll music	 smoking weed	 and having sex in the back a fancy van(often all at the same time). This is what a good teen party movie should be.<br /><br />There isn't much of a plot other than the fact that the main character fantasizes about having sex with his arch rivals good looking girlfriend ...he blows all of his college savings money to purchase a tricked out Dodge Van(with shag carpet walls . mirrored ceiling and a water bed in it)to get her attention	 and he eventually gets to have sex with her. But his arch rival finds out and comes looking for him (so that the two of them can settle their differences by drag racing their vans)....he and his arch rival end up wrecking both of their vans	 and instead of stealing away his arch rivals girlfriend	 he wins over the heart of a preppy(lesser attractive) girl that he half/ass dates through most of the movie and he decides he is happier/better off and the movie ends.<br /><br />the movie does have it's funny moments. But watching this movie 30+ years later	 it becomes more of a trip down memory lane. Because I still can remember Pizza parlors	 pinball arcades	 It also brought back memories of cruising around a small town while we smoked pot as we would yell at good looking girls and hoping to get laid (sometimes I'd get lucky and get some decent looking girl to share a joint with me and we'd screw in the backseat afterwords	 I also remember many of the songs in this move(when they were new)......this movie serves as a perfect time capsule for that era in those regards (brought back lots of memories)<br /><br />the one thing that is depicted in this movie that I honestly can not remember is ....I never remember a time when full sized vans were as popular as this film depicts them as being. I remember that era very well	 and I don't young men going around wishing they had a van. Instead I remember young men in the 70's (self included) wanting a Pontiac Trans Am	 Chevy Camaro or a hot rod Ford Mustang	 but never a van. This movie makes it appear as if vans were most popular item going and that every young man wanted one(which just wasn't true of that era)"	0.0
"I rented this by mistake. I thought	 after a cursory examination of the box	 that this was a time-travel/sci-fi story. Instead	 it's a ""Christian"" story	 and I suppose is fairly typical example. If you are sold on the message you probably will overlook the awkwardness of the plot/acting/etc.	 but I found it rather painful. <br /><br />I have to admit that I'm bothered by the rewriting of history in this story. It paints the 1890's as some sort of paradise of family values and morality (a character is aghast that 5% of marriages end in divorce!)	 but it overlooks very unsavory sides of this ""highly moral"" society (rigid racial	 sexual	 and social discrimination were widespread	 for instance). And at one point the hero complains to a clothing store owner about things that sound not all that different than the complaints of some Iranian leaders about women's clothing styles (as reported in a recent WSJ).<br /><br />Overall	 thought	 I suppose that it's the sort of thing you'll like if you like this sort of thing	 and it's certainly wholesome..."	0.0
"I'm a big fan of fan of film noir	 and this film by Otto Preminger easily stands as one of the best that I've seen! Preminger has reunited two of his stars from the hit 'Laura' - Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews	 for an entirely different sort of crime film. Laura was based around love	 and this film is based around hate; as we watch police detective Mark Dixon	 a copper already suffering scrutiny from his superiors for his heavy handed tactics	 accidentally kill a suspect and try to pin the murder on a known criminal; a man by the name of Tommy Scalisi. The plot is brilliantly worked	 and Preminger excellently balances several plot points; but it all comes back down to the main moral implication surrounding our main character. The fact that the film is set in the criminal underground means that the plot is given an excellent base to work from	 and director Otto Preminger expertly captures the sleazier side of life by showing the main characters gambling	 beating one another (and their women)	 shooting and more - and this also helps to offset the film from the earlier 'Laura'	 which was very much set in upper class society.<br /><br />The role of Mark Dixon gives Dana Andrews one of the most interesting parts of his career. Here	 we have a character that is difficult to like as he's so cold - but the fact that we can understand his motives ensures that he's easy to sympathise with	 and that allows the audience the ability to plug into his plight. The character development is well timed	 and as we've follows this character and his motivations throughout the film; everything makes sense by the end. His co-star is the beautiful Gene Tierney	 who isn't given as much to do in this film as she was in Laura; a film that made Tierney its linchpin. She does well with what she's got	 however	 and the lead duo's chemistry is excellent and Tierney helps to complete every scene she's in. I can't say that this is a better film than the earlier Laura; that's a hard act to follow	 but this film certainly fits into the film noir formula better than Preminger's earlier film. The film also makes a good comparison piece for Laura; as just about everything in this film is opposite to the 1944 movie	 yet it's all strangely familiar. Highly recommended to all!"	1.0
"Herbie	 the Volkswagen that thinks like a man	 is back	 now being driven by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan)	 a young woman who hopes to become a NASCAR champion. The only thing standing in her way is the current champion	 Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon)	 who will do anything to stop them.<br /><br />The original love bug wasn't that good. Even as a kid	 I remember not liking it very much. I had some hope for the sequel though. I mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie. Unfortunately	 Herbie is no better now than he was before. The film is defiantly weak for people over the age of 12. It will probably entertain the kids but that's all.<br /><br />I realize it's a kids film and all but they could have made the film a little more interesting. There were very few laughs and it got boring near the end. Most of the actors seemed dead in their roles too. Lindsay Lohan was alright as Maggie Peyton. She usually gives better performances like in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave the best performance out of everyone. He was very good as the bad guy even though he didn't have a lot to work with. Justin Long	 Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really just there and they don't do anything special.<br /><br />Angela Robinson directs and she does an okay job. She tries to keep the film interesting but she's working with a weak script. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the screenplay and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for Taxi and The Pacifier? These two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable. It's not completely their fault but hopefully next time they will try harder. In the end	 Herbie is a safe	 predictable family film that's worth watching if you're a kid. Everyone else is better off skipping it. Rating 4/10"	0.0

"I loved this movie. It is rare to get a glimpse of post-partum Vietnam	 and this movie-sans combat scenes and exciting bombs and gunfire- did it. I had no idea I'd be so affected by it. What an amazing look at how alien Vets feel. It was tough to watch	 quite frankly. We all understand the fighting and the Apocalypse Now type of drama	 but this is so so different. What happens when they come back and try to live a life? They can't. It made me very aware of a large group of men that are rattling around lost in America. Not able to relate	 can't sleep	 can't have love affairs	 can't deal with ""normal society"". They feel totally apart. This is a huge tragedy	 and one that isn't addressed enough. Yeah	 we've changed our attitude about Vietnam Vets	 we like them now	 but so what? It doesn't seem to have made any difference to them. It's too late? So it was a great film	 but I cried a lot.

Robert DeNiro is hysterical. Relative newcomer Charlie Cox is an incredible leading man. Claire Danes is fantastic as always.

"This movie is one of the most wildly distorted portrayals of history. Horribly inaccurate	 this movie does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of Dutch	 British	 Chinese	 American and indigenous enslaved laborers that the sadistic Japanese killed and tortured to death. The bridge was to be built ""over the bodies of the white man"" as stated by the head Japanese engineer. It is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors committed by the Japanese captors is the source of a movie	 where the bridge itself	 isn't even close to accurate to the actual bridge. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete	 not wood. What of the survivors who are still alive today? They hate the movie and all that it is supposed to represent. Their friends were starved	 tortured	 and murdered by cruel sadists. Those that didn't die of dysantry	 starvation	 or disease are deeply hurt by the movie that makes such light of their dark times."	0.0
"Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid. I used to borrow the books from the school library every chance I got. My favorite one was ""The Red Sea Sharks"" - so much action and humor.<br /><br />This documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background story of Herge and his development of Tintin. The film-maker's personal experience in interviewing Herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for the Chan character was very moving.<br /><br />A great documentary of a very talented and well-loved artist. A great example of someone who has become internationally renown	 and has brought joy of millions of children (and the young at heart) all over the world."	1.0
"I suppose I always felt that Hotel du Nord was studio-bound	 the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location. But no problem - it's still a much underrated lovely composition from Marcel Carne. The plot seems a bit choppy at times	 as if they were making it up as they went along	 but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end. The money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue	 but it's all so lovely to fall into any inanity can be accepted. Are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-War France or simply idiots? Suicide pacts are fairly common; if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools?<br /><br />Arletty played the part of prostitute well - she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway! I've only seen a few films with Jouvet - he is the most impressive invention as pimp in HDN - my trouble is shallow: every time I see his face I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen!<br /><br />A remarkably atmospheric	 well acted and photographed film with so much happening it needs a few viewings to get it all in place. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his 2nd film had a small amusing part as a gay man. All in all: wonderful."	1.0
"I do see what my forebears saw in the youthful Bette Davis. She's splendid throughout this almost-madcap political comedy which actually stars Warren Williams as the political operative constantly behind on his alimony. Vivienne Osborne is brilliant as his ex	 and I found myself rooting for her throughout. The Williams character is not at all sympathetic	 and he's not even a decent op.<br /><br />Guy Kibbee is one of the best at what he does. As a candidate dragged out of his sleep at a political convention and nominated to be governor in order to prevent a rival candidate from being nominated	 so this whole mess is borne of internecine political warfare in a party called the ""Progressive Party."" If you're of a political mind	 you will probably see a party other than the one with which you are affiliated reflected in the fictional ""Progressive Party"" of Williams and Kibbee. I could draw exact parallels	 but we're not here for that.<br /><br />This is a good movie for those of us who love these old comedies. If you've ever watched any of the old Wheeler & Woolsey titles (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE	 THE RAINMAKERS)	 you'll find Frank McHugh	 as Williams's right arm	 looking and behaving a lot like Bert Wheeler. He had me fooled.<br /><br />Yes	 both my wife and I recommend this one."	1.0
"This was no Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie film. It was a big wannabee. It wanted to be an edgy	 nervous-laughter	 urban-life affirming film	 but it's more of a camera jerky	 mess. It's a lot easier to imitate something else	 than to create a real story with real characters. From the beginning	 I couldn't care less about the characters or what they were involved in. They were always always hitting	 pissing	 or crying on each other. Only	 there wasn't any substance to what they were doing. The dialog between characters is meant to be hip	 revealing	 instead it comes out trite	 and one scene after another is predictable.

"Hey now	 yours truly	 TheatreX	 found this while grubbing through videos at the flea market	 in almost new condition	 and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a ""cult hit"" so of course it came home with me. <br /><br />What a strange film. The aunt and cousin of former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis live in this decaying 28 room house out on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and share the house with raccoons	 cats	 fleas (eyow!) and who knows what else. Suffolk Co. was all over them at one point for living in filth and old Jackie herself came by to set things right. Anyway	 this is one strange pair	 Big Edie and Little Edie...Edie (the daughter) always wears something over her head and dances	 sings	 and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense. Big Edie (the mother	 age 79) apparently likes to run around naked	 and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully (?) done to the point where we're mercifully spared from that. These women talk and talk and talk	 mostly about the past	 and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense	 except to them. They live in absolute filth	 cats doing their business wherever (""Look	 that cat's going to the bathroom behind my portrait!"")	 and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations. If I close my eyes and listen to Big Edie's voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt	 who was from that area of the country and had that Lawn Guyland accent. One scene has Little Edie putting on flea repellent	 lovely	 you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested. The box refers to these two women as ""eccentric""	 and I'd have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for ""wacked out of their gourds""	 but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them. This is equal parts creepy	 sad	 and disgusting	 but I couldn't stop watching once I started. This is not my ""normal"" type of flick but I found it to be somewhat fascinating. It won't be for everybody though	 guaranteed."	1.0
"An excellent movie and great example of how scary a movie can be without really showing the viewer anything. It's a set of four stories all revolving around the tenants of a charmingly old-fashioned house and their various gruesome and horrific fates	 all tied together by a wrap-around story about a Scotland Yard inspector searching for a missing horror film star. It starts out with a story about a mystery writer whose main character becomes a little too realistic	 followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who become obsessed over a wax figure in a museum	 then a story about a sweetly angelic little child who is anything but	 and closing with the story of what happened to the missing film star and what he does to the inspector. It's a gorgeous print that lets you really appreciate the work of director Duffell and what he was able to accomplish with a very small budget. Add to that the acting talents of Peter Cushing	 Christopher Lee	 Denholm Elliott	 Joss Ackland	 Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee and you've got a movie that can be enjoyed again and again. Just don't answer the phone if anyone from Stoker Real Estate calls to offer you a bargain on a beautiful house in the English countryside"	1.0
"Need I say--its a stinker! (I gave it a rating of 2)<br /><br />Only watch it if you suffer from insomnia.<br /><br />There's plenty of scenery chewing and hamming it up	 but not much else happens in this movie. There is no suspense	 no deep	 shocking secrets revealed	 no real threat to the heroine's well being. A few disagreements	 slight raising of voices--that's pretty much it. The secrets are nothing that couldn't happen to anybody - the last ""secret"" revealed in the film is totally predictable by that point.<br /><br />The plot	 such as it is	 revolves around a young woman named Faith (Meg Tilly)	 who is an artist	 who is hired to paint a series of mural panels in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion by a very	 very wealthy	 older widowed woman	 and a growing mother/daughter type relationship that the older woman craves with her.<br /><br />It turns out the older woman's daughter	 Cassandra	 is dead. You can pretty well fit the rest of the pieces together.<br /><br />Even the scene with the mysterious man menacing our heroine does not advance to the point where you really fear for her safety beyond maybe a second or two. Why he's still hanging around years after Cassandra's death is a good question.<br /><br />There's also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant	 a faithful butler who seems to do everything--cooking	 cleaning	 serving the meal	 answering the door	 etc. Everything except apparently locking the door--since that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just walks into a room where Faith is.<br /><br />There's nothing that will have you grasping your chair arms	 and leaning forward on the edge of your seat	 because there IS no ""mounting"" tension in this film--just bland	 pathetic revelations that get tossed out from time to time.<br /><br />"	0.0

"I don't believe they made this film. Completely unnecessary. The first film was okay. But there was no need for a sequel	 certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film. This film feels like a soap-opera. The writing is so bad	 it's utterly simple. The jokes don't come across	 the acting is flat	 it's shot like a soap	 it lacks any direction. The first film had a good emotional spine behind it. Every character had a little arc. It was very simple then but somehow it worked and I could see the merit of that film. But this time around	 there is no cohesive story-line. The characters are dull stereotypes and nothing interesting happens. One good thing: the Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleire's son is pretty well cast. That was their one moment of creative success on this film. I hear they already shot a second television series as a sequel to 'Team Spirit 2' but please God	 don't let them make a third feature installment..."	0.0
"i was disappointed. the film was a bit predictable and did not live up to the hype plastered all over the box. Having said that	 the characters were well developed	 the windego myth was used in a unique premise and the house was pretty spooky but it just missed for me. I kept waiting for that big AHHHHH or BOO! But it never came.<br /><br />Furthermore the movie was plagued with poor filming of poor special effects. Thus showing to much of a bad thing and not using atmosphere and viewer imagination to create the horror and suspense. Try movies like Session 9 or the Cube if your looking for a low-budget but well conceived horror movie."	0.0
"The reason why I say this is because I wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until I was asked to see the film. I wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine	 I got to hear about it. I had only written a first draft so I was understandably worried when I heard that it was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson	 through my agent	 whether he might like me to do another draft. I also asked if I could I see my original script because I had lost it. I was told	 too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name off. I had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay. Then I was invited to see the finished film. I was so impressed that I very quickly asked to have my name put back on. It's a beautifully made piece	 from a hurriedly written first draft	 I expected to be asked to do much more work on it; perhaps if I had it wouldn't be so good.

This was one of my favourite films as a kid. I was in love with Charlie and at the tender age of about five or six	 I'll admit... I had a crush on a cartoon dog. All Dogs tells the dark story of lovable cad Charlie and his partner in crime Itchy. The story starts with Charlie escaping from death row and swaggering off to the nearest club to do some gambling. Of course	 as a child	 I didn't understand the concept of this film. I loved the songs and the animation but as I've got older I do begin to wonder why I wasn't disturbed by this film as a youngster. It deals with pretty adult themes --- gambling	 murder	 hell and prison but in a world of goody-goody Disney films	 it's something every child should watch once. <br /><br />Yes	 there's some sort of crazy transvestite crocodile scene and the hell scenes scare me more now that when I was little	 but it delivers such a poignant message that should not be ignored by parents!"	1.0
"I have a feeling that the Warners Bros Depression-era musicals are going to become a lot more pertinent in the next couple of years. Yes	 we are in the economic doldrums (or have you been living under a rock) and times look bleak. But we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles. In the 30's	 film-going was hugely popular even at the height of economic gloom. ""Footlight Parade (1933)"" was one such film that audiences flocked to. While this Lloyd Bacon-directed musical doesn't quite capture the social issues of the time as ""Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933)"" does	 it's still a wonderful showcase of talent. We have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece Busby Berkely extravaganza numbers	 but boy	 are they worth waiting for me. Yes	 little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress	 and her tapping is so-so	 but Busby's magical ""By A Waterfall"" whisks her	 and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls	 into a dizzying water wonderland. Of course Busby's numbers could never really be performed on a stage (they defy limits of gravity	 for one thing)	 and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough	 wisecracking non-musical scenes. And ""Footlight"" also has James Cagney in at the one of his all-too-few musicals (really	 what couldn't this man do?). He even gets to take over from the leading man	 don sailor garb and fawn over sexpot Shanghai Lil (who is really little Ruby in China-girl wig!).He co-stars with Joan Blondell	 his adorable	 adoring secretary who Cagney somehow overlooks in favour of other women (until the final reel	 that is). Apparently Blondell was the only other woman who Cagney loved apart from his wife. And you can see the mutual adoration in every scene."	1.0
"Kabei: Our Mother (2008) is a poetic and sublime beauty from Japan. A real weeper! I had heard great reviews for the film and rented it from Netflix. Am I glad I did! In many ways this film reminded me of the old style of Japanese classic film-making from the 1940's and 1950's that I've come to love so much	 such as seen in Yasujiro Ozu pictures -- the title credits even begin in the same way	 with the Japanese letters (characters) in red against neutral color burlap material. I immediately thought: this director loves Ozu. The same style was used too: mostly indoor sets with only a few outdoor scenes. Even a couple of ""pillow shots""	 as Roger Ebert calls them. The strength of the film is built on the love of the characters for one another.<br /><br />The story follows the lives of a Japanese family before	 and during	 and after	 World War Two. The mother takes care of her growing girls the best she can after the father (a University professor) is arrested for anti-war sympathies. He's never freed and only has a few brief meetings with his wife in prison before he dies of starvation and disease. Meanwhile a former student of the professor comes by often to help take care of the mother and two girls. He begins to fall in love with the mother and is a substitute father for the two girls. But war starts and he's drafted and they have to say an abrupt farewell. Will they ever express their love for one another? Will he ever return from the war? <br /><br />There is so much heart and gentle spirit in the performance of the lead actress	 Sayuri Yoshinaga. She's almost a Madonna type	 she's so beautiful! Big soulful eyes and flawless skin. The actor who plays the student is phenomenal as well: his name is Tadanobu Asano. What a sensitive performance. There is no macho in him at all; he's gentle and kind. I'd certainly love to see both of these two in other movies. I think I'll check to see what's available for them. The two little child actresses are wonderful too.<br /><br />The film is just released on NTSC DVD for American audiences	 with very easy to read English subtitles. I gave it a 10 out of 10 on the IMDb. I cried almost as much as with the Japanese film classic Twenty-Four Eyes (1954). Don't miss this film!"	1.0
"I saw this film on TV many years ago and I saw this film when I got this on tape. I thought that this was reasonably well done. It was not the best of all movies	 but it was good enough. The movie has enough talent to inspire many people	 especially younger kids. The acting was good	 with Danny Glover leading the cast. The plot line was not very believable	 but the script was well written. This movie can also be the interest of avid baseball fans. It does not directly apply to a action-packed sports movie. It directly applies to a nice film that you can watch with your family and learn some messages that are hidden in this film. Overall	 the film was good	 but not great. I give this a movie a 7/10."	1.0
"Yuck! And again I say...YUCK! The original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it. And	 it had a naked chick on a motorcycle.<br /><br />This version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest. It looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute. The movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance. It is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife.<br /><br />There was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry..."	0.0
"This production was made in the middle 1980s	 and appears to be the first serious attempt to put BLEAK HOUSE on celluloid. No film version of the novel was ever attempted (it is remarkably rich in subplots that actually serve as counterpoints to each other	 so that it would have been very hard to prune it down). The novel was the only attempt by Dickens to make a central narrator (one of two in the work) a woman	 Esther Summerson. Esther is raised by her aunt and uncle	 who (in typical Dickens style) mistreat her. She is illegitimate	 but they won't tell her anything about her parentage. Later we get involved with the gentry	 Sir Leicester Dedlock	 and his wife. Lady Honoria Deadlock (Dame Diana Rigg) is having an increasingly difficult time regarding her private life and the meddling involvement of the family solicitor Tulkinghorn (Peter Vaughn). We also are involved with the actions of Richard Carstone (Esther's boyfriend) in trying to win a long drawn out estate chancery case	 Jarndyce v. Jarndyce	 which everyone (even Richard's cousin John Jarndyce - played by Desmond Elliot) warns is not worth the effort.<br /><br />Dickens had been a law reporter and then a parliamentary reporter before he wrote fiction. Starting with the breach of promise case in PICKWICK PAPERS	 Dickens looked closely at the law. Mr. Bumble said it was ""a ass"" in OLIVER TWIST and Dickens would consistently support that view. He looks at the slums as breeding grounds for crime in TWIST	 that the law barely tries to cure. He attacks the Chancery and outdated estate laws	 as well as too powerful solicitors and greedy lawyers (Tulkinghorn	 Vholes) in BLEAK HOUSE. In LITTLE DORRIT he attacks the debtors' prisons (he had hit it also in David COPPERFIELD). In OUR MUTUAL FRIEND he looks at testators and wills. In THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD he apparently was going to go to a murder trial. Dickens was far more critical of legal institutions than most of his contemporaries	 including Thackeray.<br /><br />But the novel also looks at other problems (like charity and religious hypocrisy	 the budding Scotland Yard detective force	 social snobbery in the industrial revolution). He also uses the novel to satirize various people: Leigh Hunt the writer	 Inspector Fields of Scotland Yard	 and even the notorious Maria Manning. Most of these points were kept in this fine mini-series version. If it is shown again on a cable station	 catch it."	1.0
"There is a reason why Jay Leno himself will not acknowledge this film. It consistently ranks as one of the worst films of all time. The acting is horrible	 the script lacks direction and the director himself doesn't seem sure on which way to take this film. ""A buddy film	"" ""an action/comedy	"" ""mystery."" Seems half way through	 he gives up	 and is just along for the ride. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated performers. It is a shame that they wasted their time and gifts making this mess of a movie. Jay Leno and Pat Morita prior to involving themselves with this	 had spent years pounding out their crafts on the Hollywood circuit. Mr. Morita had already been a star in his own right	 acting steadily since the mid 1960s as the star of such cult TV and movie classics as ""Happy Days	"" and the dismal but affable ""Mr. T and Tina."" And won the hearts of America with his roles in the powerful film	 ""Midway	"" ""The Karate Kid	"" and a host of others. Mr. Leno can been seen on TV shows dating back to the mid 70s. And was a top performer in the comedy clubs of America. He can be seen in countless TV spots and in major films. It is a shame	 that they agreed to be seen with this nonsense."	0.0
"This ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of ""Hamlet"" to ever reach the screen. Branagh's approach to the material can only be described as vulgar; going to such lengths as depicting Ophelia in a straight jacket	 having Fortinbras' army appear suddenly on the horizon (looking very much like the climax of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"") when the palace is apparently guarded only by Francisco (who shouts the very un-Shakespearean cry of ""ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack"" before being gunned down)	 and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of Jimmy Cagney's Bottom and Mary Pickford's Kate.<br /><br />Branagh chose to set his film in an Edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text	 so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in Elizabethan mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed. And Branagh does not concern himself with such textural subtleties as the ambiguous nature of Hamlet and Olphelia's relationship	 treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window.<br /><br />The uncut text does allow Branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime: more footage of Kenneth Branagh. This is never so apparent as in the ""How All Occasions Inform Against Me"" speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film (at least that's how it feels)	 which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of Gone With The Wind's ""I'll never be hungry again."" This may serve Branagh's ego	 but it does not serve Shakespeare or the speech: when I saw the film in the theater	 I leaned over to my companion and snickered ""Great Moments With Mr. Hamlet."" Branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last	 when he attempts to out-do the Olivier film and its justly celebrated death of Claudius by having Hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch	 impaling him with a sword. Branagh's Dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through Claudius' heart with a super hero's bulls eye. The only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so off-the-wall funny.<br /><br />While this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy	 it is in fact nothing but a star-studded display of a once-talented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism. The Emperor has no clothes	 and this Hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one man's ego out of control."	0.0
"He now has a name	 an identity	 some memories and a a lost girlfriend. All he wanted was to disappear	 but still	 they traced him and destroyed the world he hardly built. Now he wants some explanation	 and to get ride of the people how made him what he is. Yeah	 Jason Bourne is back	 and this time	 he 's here with a vengeance.<br /><br />OK	 this movie doesn't have the most elaborated script in the world	 but its thematics are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society. Of course	 like every Hollywoodian movie since the end of the 90's	 ""The Bourne Suprematy"" is a super-heroes story. Jason Bourne is a Captain-America project-like	 who's gone completely wrong. In the first movie	 the hero discovered his abilities and he accepted them in the second one. He now fights against what he considers like evil	 after a person close to him has been killed (his girlfriend in ""Suprematy"") by them. That's all a part of the super-hero story	 including a character with (realistic but still impressive : he almost invincible) super powers.<br /><br />And the interesting point is that the evil he fights all across the world (there's no frontiers in the Bourne's movies	 characters are going from one continent to another in the blink of an eye)	 is	 as in the best seasons of ""24""	 an American enemy	 who's beliefs that he fight for the good of his country completely blinds him. Funny how ""mad patriots"" are now the N.1 enemies of paranoiac Hollywood's stories.<br /><br />Beside all those interesting thematics	 the movie isn't flawless : the feminine character of Nickie Parson is for now on completely useless and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogs scenes. But all that doesn't really matter	 for ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is an action movie. And the action scenes are rather impressive.<br /><br />Everyone here is talking about the ""Waterloo scene"" and the ""Tanger pursuit"" and everyone's right. I particularly enjoyed the fight in Tanger	 that reminds my in its exaggeration and craziness the works of Tsui Hark. Visually inventive scenes	 lots of intelligent action parts and a good reflection on American's contemporary thematics : ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action flick."	1.0
"There aren't enough gay-themed movies and there aren't enough `coming out' movies. Every one is a welcome addition to the genre. Although the production values are high(the movie `looks' good	 Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks REAL good in a pair of jeans) this is a bad one. It is a period piece: gay life under an oppressive regime(East Berlin	 1989) a life that seems 40 years behind the west. In a way we're seeing our own history; what it might have been like for gays in the 40's and 50's here(it often reminded me of `Last Exit to Brooklyn :the book not the film).But it is unremittingly depressing and SLOW in a contrived way that evoked an old SCTV send up of Ingmar Bergman. It is so sloppily edited I wonder if the director just didn't hack at random. Yes	 it is a miracle that this was filmed and released before The Wall came down and yes	 life behind the `Curtain' was hard for gay people. A good director could have shown all that without stupefying the audience. A good director would have had me mark this one as one of the great coming-out movies and not one of the misses."	0.0

"...but this just isn't working and I am surprised to see how many people consider it good. On what grounds? There are some loose hints here and there	 but the whole material is self-indulgent and unconvincing. Lynch's movies are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet	 are very playful when doing that. There is some visual sense	 there are some subplots	 characters	 ideas etc. But this is dull and yes	 pointless. Because whatever there is to explore is either to ""small""	 either too far-fetched	 or simply told before in a superior manner. It's just Lynch exploring DV	 nothing more so it should be treated like this. 1/10"	0.0
"First of all	 I don't understand why some people find this movie so anti-american. Sure	 there are moments when the U.S. are accused directly	 like at the segments of Youssef Chahine	 Ken Loach and	 to a certain extent	 Mira Nair. But come on	 they aren't naive accusations; instead	 they are based on real and documented facts	 and all the documents that the CIA released about Chile confirms this	 for example.<br /><br />But returning to the film itself	 what I enjoyed most on it is the variety of moods we find in it. We find children being educated for the respect of the all the people who died in the event; we find a unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day; we find common people that have their feelings downgraded on the shadow of the events of September 11 and react differently to this	 with dignity or frustration; we even find someone in the movie for who the fall of the towers grounds for a moment of real happiness.<br /><br />All these visions and others - as powerful as these or even more - make a consistent blend and help the spectator to have a glimpse about how different people spread across the world reacted to the events of September 11th. Thus	 what we see is a panorama that is much more complex than whites and blacks	 and this may make some people infuriated; but this is the world where we live	 and in it there is no place for manicheistic ideologies	 regardless of what presidents or priests may say us.<br /><br />Finally	 I think it's a shame that there isn't even a release date for this movie in the United States of America. It's a shame because most of the american people is asking why this catastrophe happened	 and this movie could give some clues to them. This film puts very clearly - differently of what some people of this forum think - that everything we do today will determine our future	 and that the errors of the past will affect how we live today."	1.0

"This movie is a classic in every sense of the word. It is very entertaining and also very disturbing. The acting in this movie is well done. The story itself is believable	 suspenseful	 and well thought out. Character development is also done well	 the audience can clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this film. The villains in this movie are very threatening	 from the first moment the audience sees them they can tell that they are up to something. This movie shows how a human being	 when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods	 facing a life or death situation can slowly become almost as wild and feral as the animals that inhabit it. Not everyone is going to like this film	 there is a lot of disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable. It is definitely worth watching. This movie is a masterpiece."	1.0
"This was surprisingly intelligent for a TV movie	 and quite true to my own experience of bulimia. It was actually well-researched	 and I can only assume it was written by someone who's gone through a similar experience	 because it had all the little details. The characters were quite well-drawn	 and the performances by Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman were great. I think what I like most was that they made them specific and smart	 and there was no dumbing down of the reasons for Beth's bulimia (it wasn't some ""diet gone out of control	 caused by the pressures placed on girls by the media	 pressures we're not actually going to address...""). Her mother wasn't completely clueless - too often on television they'll take an issue that EVERYONE has some awareness of and try to tell us that their protagonists are the last remaining people on earth who don't (""Diabetes? What's that? Oh	 my world is all askew	 doctor	 please explain it all to me as if I'm a small child""	 etc). It was brilliant that her mother was a psychologist and even she didn't see the signs. And the scenes where Beth was throwing up weren't OVERLY melodramatic and sensationalist	 and concentrated more on bulimics' need for secrecy	 and their out-of-controlness. The scene where Beth tells her mother she's bulimic would've made me cry if there hadn't been other people in the room.<br /><br />Okay	 so I liked those bits. What didn't work for me so well was the ending	 which headed back to the TV movie territory we know and don't particularly love	 but I guess they had to wrap it up. ""You	 too	 can cure your child's eating disorder	 if you have lots and lots of money and live in America...""<br /><br />And can I just say again that I really like Mare Winningham. She's great."	1.0

"The Japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy movies. They have always been ready to destroy cities by huge plastic monsters coming from outer space and elsewhere. The problem is they have never had the money to succeed in making convincing special effects. This film	 released in France under the title Les envahisseurs de l'espace	 is no exception. Its ambition is to show three creatures from the giant octopus to the giant lobster trying to have the upper hand on the humans. It's extremely awkward and laughable	 but well quite enjoyable too.

"Bad movie for sure. It's such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of poor special effects	 a lot of hasty scenes (the airport one for example)	 and a real unfunny time. (Charles Dance) is awful as the evil guy and he is much better in (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) is doing a non-comic joking	 and I heard that this sunk had already succeed	 big time success??!!

Well	 no my friend. It's the cinematic foolishness which made a lot of RAZZIE movies all over the years whether it's the 1980s or the 1950s ! <br /><br />There are 2 reasons made me write about this movie. The first is that I'll never forget the long tan fascinating legs of (Charlotte Lewis) especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house	 wearing just a blue shirt and OH BOY the camera was versifying about her naked legs as it should be. But how odd ! As I've watched her in following movies and she wasn't that beautiful again ?!!

"Trey Parker and Matt Stone	 the creators of the show 'South Park' 	 return with something entirely different.They create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball.This sport is known as baseketball.It's like basketball except that the rules of baseball are involved and there's another letter e in the title.Here's how you play: you just shoot the ball while these two guys try to distract you from making the shot.Sounds simple.In fact	 I might try it one day.After the game hits the streets	 it soon becomes a huge success.Who would've known that 2 immature friends could invent a sport that became so successful?<br /><br />My opinion<br /><br />'Baseketball' is a very crude and silly spoof filled with lots of slapstick violence	 yet it actually delivers some laughs and plenty of entertainment.A definite recommendation for those of you who like slapstick and rude humor."	1.0

"You may want to know up front that I am not a Mormon	 unlike a good number of those who have already reviewed this film. I mention this so you'll understand that the way I look at the film may differ greatly from those in the faith. For some	 being critical of the film might be seen as being critical of the faith--and that is NOT my intention. So	 my review is that of an outsider trying to look inside and learn more about who this man and his people were. Well	 after seeing the film	 I doubt if I have learned much at all. Since I have been a history teacher	 I have a good basic understanding about Young as well as Joseph Smith as well as the teachings of the church. But anyone wanting to see this film to really learn anything will probably be disappointed because the film seems so gosh-darn nice--too nice and too unrealistic in its portrayal. Plus	 you learn practically nothing about the church's beliefs other than they are nice people	 work hard and some have many wives (and this latter part is only barely hinted at in the film). Instead	 the people are almost cartoon-like in their simplistic portrayals. Joseph Smith and Brigham Young and their followers are angelic	 the non-Mormons were all devils and Brian Donlevy (playing EXACTLY the same sort of role Edward G. Robinson later played in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS) is the trouble-maker who claims to be a Mormon but just comes along so the film can have a bad guy. It's all so very simple....too simple. Almost like an indoctrination film or infomercial.<br /><br />Brigham Young especially was a very complex man--with many good points (an excellent organizer and visionary) as well as bad (don't even get me started on his views about Blacks within the church or intermarriage). To portray him in such vague terms is just plain silly. It's also a lot like how Gandhi was portrayed in the film with Ben Kingsley--only the facts that led to his being almost super-human were emphasized. Heck	 now that I think about that	 this is the trouble with most religious films--they often come off as one-dimensional	 trite and bland. Let's have a full and more complete film of these men--one that will stick to facts and not emotional appeals.<br /><br />Now if you can ignore the fact that you won't learn very much about the faith or its second leader	 the film is enjoyable enough. It's obvious someone at 20th Century-Fox really cared about the film	 as they had a wonderful cast of both premier actors (Tyrone Power)	 up and coming actors (Linda Darnell	 Jane Darwell and Vincent Price) and wonderful character actors (Dean Jagger	 John Carradine and Brian Donlevy). The film also had wonderful location shooting and lots of gloss. It just didn't have a lot to tell us other than they were all ""swell"". Plus	 there were plenty of factual errors and a few just plain dumb scenes. A few of the mistakes include Young taking over the helm immediately after the death of Joseph Smith (it was three years later)	 no mention of the various Mormon denominations and splinter groups	 talk of ""gold in California""--even though it was 1847 and gold wouldn't be discovered until 1948	 as well as no specific mention of polygamy or Smith's many wives. Just plain dumb scenes include Carradine pulling out a gun and waving it about in the courtroom scene--and no one seemed to care--even though it was a very hostile audience! Don't you think at least the judge would tell him to put it away and stop threatening people with it?!<br /><br />One final comment. Do not	 I repeat	 do not watch this film when it's shown on American Movie Classics (a one great station that has sunk a lot in recent years). While I am critical of the film because of its simplistic message	 I was horrified with the complete disrespect the station had for the church and its traditions. What I mean is this. The film was punctuated with ads for penis enlargement formulas as well as tons of pop-ups (some advertising a show that features the ""sexiest cast""). Talk about disrespectful and gross and I would be just as offended if they did this for any other religious film. By doing this	 they not only insult the faith but marginalize their market--after all	 who is into hearing about these things AND the life of Brigham Young?! Is this a movie	 in this form	 that you can show to your kids or recommend to others?!"	0.0
"I saw this movie a few days ago and gamely jumped during the scary parts. I must admit	 I found it pretty decent...until I started to THINK about what the characters were saying. Logical problems:<br /><br />1. Her boyfriend	 who seems to be a pretty fit dude	 makes no sound while being killed. Don't you think that he might have at least tried to take the killer? <br /><br />2. When the remark is made that the gym teacher is ""SOOOO in love with Lisa	"" I almost screamed at the screen. When your best friend's family HAS BEEN KILLED BY A TEACHER WHO WAS IN LOVE WITH HER	 you don't make comments like that if you have half of a heart.<br /><br />3. As soon as Nash asks the uncle how many exits they have in the house and the uncle catches on that there may be danger ahead	 wouldn't the smart thing to do be to get Donna	 boyfriend	 aunt	 and uncle into a car and drive far	 far away	 then bait the house with the HRT and police force so that the killer has no way to get out?<br /><br />I could go on. And on. And on. Basically	 the plot was decent	 the characters weren't profiled enough for you to actually feel any empathy when they were slaughtered and there were way too many errors.<br /><br />HOWEVER.<br /><br />This movie might be good for teenagers	 or young couples just looking for a fun night out.

They run through the hallways and stairwells	 encountering all of the band members of the heavy metal band in their outlandish	 shock-rock costumes... Nothing really memorable here	 except the lousy acting	 lack of gore/nudity	 and the utterly shameless promotional edge	 reminding me very much of ""KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park"". Yeah	 remember that dud? Wish I didn't... I would just recommend avoiding all of these Ghost House films like a fungus and not listen to Lordi since they are a Gwar ripoff band!"	0.0
"Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd couldn't save this movie from laying an emu-sized egg. Based on the classic Phil Silvers TV series	 it bombed because: A) It was updated to the 1990s	 and B) The simple premise of the TV series was turned into a confusing	 feeble and silly screenplay.<br /><br />The original TV series used a small cast of talented actors to portray lovable characters acting out simple yet hilarious pranks. To expand this premise into a 1990s movie was asking for trouble	 and it shows. No one could pay me enough to sit through this stinker a second time."	0.0
"I went to see this a few days ago	 and it's hard to forget that film...for the wrong reasons. This film is supposed to be funny	 it's not	 not a single laugh in the theatre( perhaps for josé garcia and gérard Depardieu )	 and it's boring	 boring	 boring. It was even hard sometimes to understand what they were saying. They just talk to fast and don't open their enough for us to understand. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times i caught myself saying after a line that was supposed to be funny "" what	 what did he say""	 and i'm french.

"I'm a big fan of the old westerns	 and do not believe that Hollywood is capable of capturing its old glory. But not even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can help this 1957 movie which carries nearly all the trite characteristics of westerns of the reformed gunfighter turned good guy. fallen but virtuous woman	 bigoted townspeople who must turn to gunfighter for salvation	 etc. I can't help but notice the last names of the writer and young ""actor"" who plays Granger's son. Any nepotism there? I've seen better acting in high school plays. Chill Wills plays a cartoon characterization of Chill Wills. Have I reached the 1000 words yet?"	0.0
"At first sight	 Who's Singing Over There just seems to be an absurd and excellent comedy with only a kind of unusual	 quiet and slow motion : what a mistake ! <br /><br />Beginning with two singers on a desert landscape	 then a bus and a wonderful bunch of actors	 it hides a gem !<br /><br />The folded story	 and a false rhythm induces you to think	 yes it is comic	 but just lets you guess it will be a gentle kind of movie. <br /><br />Not at all : very funny by instant	 dark subtle cynical on others	 its development surprises you all along the story Very ingeniously and cleverly presented	 all the characters are important	 and the actors give them full life.<br /><br />And what is astonishing	 it's based on deep observation	 great mastering of the camera work and has a great meanings	 and really everything	 the general direction and how also the details are presented	 that it simply makes you forget it's a movie: it is like to watch a kind human society	 you yet don't know	shot by a friend behind a camera.<br /><br />And you're the one behind him. It is simple	 and simply exceptional !<br /><br />Don't misunderstand me; in no way that would means the script 	 the quality of picture	 the music score have a kind of amateurish way	 no	 no ! It's great Art ! <br /><br />Because it flows like a river From high up in the mountain	 down to the sea	 with all the different sort of grounds and peregrinations that a real river will face on its journey to the sea from a tiny thing to a main stream.<br /><br />This metaphoric image I used is the very best way I can find to explain all the charm that has Who's Singing Over There. For me	 again	 I take the hammer : simply exceptional...<br /><br />I've seen that The Director is the one who made Chat Blanc/Chat Noir	 which I know is quiet famous But as I yet didn't see it	 I had no idea about this gentleman.<br /><br />Others reviewers wrote dithyrambical comments on that film	 I fully agree !<br /><br />European Eastern Cinema is not well know because seldom translated	 but I am lucky to have this exemplar one in original language	 with good English subtitles. All in all : deep	 delicious and exceptional...<br /><br />For fast and empty exploding types and special effect buffs	 avoid it at any cost	 it may be too subtle and good for you !<br /><br />But if you're interested in different genres and/or classics	 I guess you won't regret this one	 and in case of buying	 it will have good companionship in your personal DVD library	 with such no less than merited big names like Billy Wilder	 Lubitsch	 or Sacha Guitry among some of my preferred directors . At least for this movie !<br /><br />***A film is never really good unless the camera is an eyes in the head of a poet Orson Welles***"	1.0
"""Sandra	 the Making of a Woman"" is a standout among exploitation films	 and is so for two reasons: (1) an excellent	 yet effortless	 performance by Monica Gayle	 and (2) the fact that Gary Graver was at the helm of the project. These two talents	 both of whom are quite underrated	 make ""Sandra"" a film that should be seen.<br /><br />Another key element of the film's success is its realism -- there is nothing fake or ""Hollywood"" about this set-in-California film. It is truly a slice of life. The modest house in which Sandra lives at the beginning of the film	 the simple dresses worn by the character	 the scene where Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart bouncing at her front door	 and Sandra sits on the couch without make-up	 while Digart tries to sell her some cosmetics	 looking truly as if she just woke up (but nevertheless beautiful)	 the harmless weirdo Sandra picks up who likes to make love with her while he wears a bra	 the one-room apartment into which Sandra moves --all of these elements of the film seem totally real	 and as such	 the viewer is drawn into Sandra's little world from the beginning and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed. Sandra also makes her case for free love with eloquence and dignity and she comes off with a lot of class.<br /><br />This film could have easily failed in less competent hands	 and could have gone off in any of the usual sexploitation directions	 but the Garver/Gale team see to it that ""Sandra"" is not only the making of a woman but the making of an excellent film."	1.0
"This was the WORST Christmas movie I ever saw. I took my two small children to see this. It was the darkest	 most dismal plot- family has no money	 mom loses her job	 father gets killed in the bank	 bank robber steals family car with both kids in the back and after high speed chase	 drives off the bridge and drowns them in the river. Mom is left all alone. No wonder her Christmas spririt is gone. Christmas angels do not rescue children that have drowned	 and Santa does not bring back dead fathers! I thought this was the WORST message to send children. Better to tell them that there is NO Santa than show them a movie like this!!"	0.0
"I usually start by relaying the premise of the film	 but before anyone makes any hasty judgments about my review	 let me preface it by saying that I'm someone who likes most films (just check my other reviews). Alone in the Dark is a film by director Uwe Boll	 whose film right before this one was House of the Dead (2003). Like Alone in the Dark	 it was also a film adaptation of a video game. Almost everyone hated it. Well	 I loved it. I even gave it a 10 out of 10! My point in stating this (which will surely turn some readers off immediately) is that if even I hated Alone in the Dark	 there must be something wrong with it.<br /><br />The Premise: Who am I kidding? Attempting to state a premise for this film is about as easy as trying to balance the United States' budget	 but here it goes anyway. Some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost American Indian tribe. The Indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of broaching the ""second world""	 which was evil in nature. The bad stuff wiped them out	 but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key. Later	 some scientist/government researcher who had been experimenting with the paranormal	 and specifically this tribe	 decided to experiment on some kids	 to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world. (Believe it or not--everything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the film--it's just white text scrolling across a black screen with a voice-over also reading it to us). Then	 there was something about the kids being in an orphanage	 but the government takes them back out	 and then a bunch of people are searching for archaeological relics	 and there are super humans roaming around	 and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on.<br /><br />In fact	 the exposition never really stops. It's like a neverending backstory from hell. There are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films	 maybe 25. But not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film. In addition to the mystical lost Indian tribe and the superhumans	 we also get monsters that resemble a cross between Alien and a werewolf	 worms that invade your body and turn into snake-like aliens	 tunneling worms underground	 zombies	 Starship Trooper-like wars	 evil scientists	 underground lairs	 gold mines	 spooky warehouses	 impalements	 big mostly unused museums	 government conspiracies	 golden trunks pulled out of the sea	 nuns	 explosions	 complex backstabbing plots	 a very ambiguous romance	 car chases	 home invasions	 kitchen sinks . . . wait	 I can't remember if that last one was in the film. Even more amazingly (amusingly?)	 in Fangoria #240	 producer Shawn Williamson was quoted as saying	 ""We're spending much more time on story	 being very meticulous about that"". Tara Reid called Alone in the Dark ""a smarter film"".<br /><br />Let me not mislead anyone. A lot of that stuff above might sound yummy to the potential audience for this film	 but the problem is that nothing has the slightest connection to anything else. I usually had no idea what any setting's relation was to any other setting	 why we were there	 or what anyone was doing (at least when each scene began). It's just a random mishmash of settings and clichés	 as if director Uwe Boll had 250 unrelated ideas in a hat and pulled them out like lottery numbers. Then when he was done	 he and editor Richard Schwadel decided to cut the film by using dice	 then reassembled it by throwing the I Ching. Sometimes the film plays like an extended director's reel (which is a combination of short	 varied	 unrelated scenes that directors circulate to try to get work)	 but perhaps that's being too generous. I'm not sure Boll would get work if this were his reel. <br /><br />Just as I tend to at least like most films	 I tend to like most actors and most performances. It's very rare that I say that a performance was bad. Well	 Tara Reid was bad here--and I'm someone who usually likes Reid. I don't know what happened. For a large percentage of the film	 they just move her around the set like a prop. They might as well have just bought a blow-up doll. That would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings. Maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of driftwood after they saw the dailies of her mumbling nonsense dialogue in a monotone that's usually reserved for entertaining mother-in-laws.<br /><br />And speaking of that dialogue	 a lot of Alone in the Dark plays like a Godzilla film without Godzilla. By that	 I mean that it's a lot of pseudo-scientific gobbledy-gook. At least in Godzilla films	 there's a campiness to it	 because they know how ridiculous it is	 and there's a big payoff in that we get to see Godzilla destroy downtown and battle a giant gnat with radioactive death beams shooting from its eyes or something.<br /><br />Just what Stephen Dorff and Christian Slater are doing here	 besides overacting and filing lawsuits against their agents	 is difficult to say. I can't say that I thought anyone in the film had a decent performance	 although maybe Slater at least saw the cigar. I think that's unprecedented for me.<br /><br />Still	 I didn't give this film a 1. There was some competent cinematography	 even if Boll and Schwadel made mincemeat out of it	 and the hard rock tunes over the end credits were good. Heck	 even the novelette prologue wasn't so bad. I actually thought the film had promise at that point. But this may just be the worst film I've ever seen with a budget of 20 million or more."	0.0
"George Lopez is a funny man even without the sitcom. The first episodes I saw of this too often made jokes at the expense of his mom. As I have watched this more	 there has been more & more variety. No one on the cast is really safe from his wit now.<br /><br />It seems to me as this season has progressed that George is getting more comfortable with the family sitcom Dad role. At first he wasn't	 but he is getting More & more into a groove. This makes both him & the shows progressively funnier. They had added a couple of characters for George to play off this year too. His wife's dad is getting more & more involved in the plot.<br /><br />His mom is still there	 but not as central as past seasons. I think it is prudent to say with George's sense of comic timing	 & ABC's lack of good sitcoms	 George Lopez has a good chance of being here on ABC long after George W. Bush."	1.0
"When I bought this DVD I though: ""It seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in Portuguese standards let's give it a chance "" I was TOTALLY WRONG! What a disappointing movie! First	 it's not a comedy; it's a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Second	 the plot is so boring	 and leads nowhere It has no structure	 it just flows	 like the wind	 in one or another direction The production is also bad! The sound mixing is horrible	 because sometimes the voices are disconnected. It made me remind some old Portuguese movies from the 80's The acting should have been better too Well	 to sum up	 it's not with films like this one that Portuguese cinema will improve! In fact	 it was one of the worst Portuguese movies I have seen in the last years! Bad argument	 bad acting	 bad production I had no high hopes for this movie	 but it was much worse than I've ever imagined! Just forget about it!"	0.0
"The story of the untouchable who acted like a great soldier	 saving the lives of hundreds if not thousands	 is told in the 1939 film ""Gunga Din."" Based loosely on the Rudyard Kipling poem	 the film is brilliantly directed by George Stevens and stars Cary Grant	 Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor Mclagen. The title role is played by Sam Jaffe	 well known in my era as Ben Casey's boss	 Dr. Zorba	 a name that became synonymous with big	 out of control hair. Say ""Dr. Zorba hair"" to anyone of my generation	 and they know what you're talking about.<br /><br />Set in India at the time of the British occupation	 three soldiers - two romantic	 dashing figures in Grant and Fairbanks	 and McLagen as a big lug - are cut-ups - in reality	 three overgrown boys. Gunga Din is the water carrier	 treated somewhat meanly - verbally	 anyway - by McChesney (McLaglen)	 but Cutter (Grant) is fond of him. When he catches Din (pronounced Deen) practicing being his soldier walk and salute as he apes the unit during their maneuvers	 Cutter gives him a few pointers.<br /><br />The merry band of musketeers is going to break up when Ballantine (Fairbanks) announces he's about to be married to a lovely young woman (Joan Fontaine) and leaving the service. However	 when Gunga Din and Cutter run across Thugees	 a murderous cult led by a guru (Eduardo Cianelli)	 Gunga Din escapes to warn the unit	 and Ballantine insists on re-enlisting to help save Cutter. It's a buddy movie after all.<br /><br />""Gunga Din"" starts out lightheartedly	 with slapstick and wonderful	 broad comedy	 particularly by Cary Grant	 who is quite funny. Both he and Fairbanks are so handsome	 it's hard to decide which one to look at first. Much of the film is made up of huge action sequences which are very exciting. In the last part	 the story becomes very dramatic and culminates in a tense	 thrilling battle.<br /><br />Grant has the showiest role	 Fairbanks is the lovesick romantic	 and McLaglen as McChesney	 mostly due to his treatment of Gunga Din	 is the most unlikeable character	 although one detects his soft heart in his love for his elephant Annie. His softness comes through toward the end of the movie	 particularly in the very touching	 tear-jerking final scene.<br /><br />Always a gentle and likable actor	 Sam Jaffe gives a beautiful performance as Gunga Din	 a simple	 brave man with a big smile	 powerful imagination and lofty dreams. Without much dialogue	 Jaffe conveys Gunga Din's soul magnificently.<br /><br />This is truly the ultimate adventure film	 massive in scope	 with good acting	 rousing scenes	 a wonderful musical score	 and some beautiful cinematic images. Another one from that remarkable year	 1939. Highly recommended."	1.0
"Out of all the Princess stories Disney has put out there	 Cinderella probably has the most enduring appeal. I can't really say why	 but for some reason	 generation after generation thrusts her to the top of their lists. As a little girl	 I wanted nothing more than to be Cinderella with her glass slipper- it was my absolute favorite costume.<br /><br />Honestly	 I don't think there is any story that more realizes the longings of the human heart than Cinderella. Who has never wanted to run away from the drudgeries of daily life and find someone who sees you as no one else ever had? The story is older than the English language and somehow it still rings true.<br /><br />As for the characters	 if nothing else	 Disney can make a wonderful villain. Lady Tremaine is evil to the T	 in a wonderfully calculating	 not overtly physical way. Her cutting tongue and eyes do the work for her- she doesn't need staffs of lightening to strike fear into your heart. The animal friends tend to grate	 especially that idiotic Gus. I would have cheered had he met his fate in Lucifer's jaws. Cinderella herself was no pushover- making some justly catty remarks at times. However	 she just lacked the drive to make her entirely sympathetic. Sure	 she was nice and fed animals	 but what was keeping her at that place? We never know. Even if she only became a maid in another house	 at least she's be getting paid and have a shot at respect. It seems the only reason things work out in the end for Cindy is that everything sort of falls to place in her lap. She never works for her dreams that she sings so fondly of.<br /><br />Which brings me to the music	 which is lovely	 as ever. Ilene woods has a lovely	 rich voice	 probably my favorite of any Disney heroine. Some big standards originated here- A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes	 So This is Love	 Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo...<br /><br />Cinderella is a wonderful heartfelt story with a ton of musical highlights. While it is lacking in some character development	 it does provide some classic villains and excellent voice work.

"I highly recommend this film. Set in the Bladerunner-esquire future of 2054 Paris	 it is in most respect a classic film noir script: lady in peril	 sister trying to find her	 honest cop fighting everyone. Luckily	 it avoids being stereotypical	 and combines a pretty good storyline with interesting	 innovative visuals. The film might remind you of Sin City in look	 but it has an even sharper	 even more graphic novel look that I found really compelling. Each frame	 each sequence seems like it could have been pulled from the desk of a skilled graphic designer. In terms of story and artwork	 you can find nods going back to the nineteen forties (or even earlier with the classic views of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Couer) and movies like Casablanca	 as well as looking toward a grim future where our destines are ruled by corporations. Make any excuse you need to see this film."	1.0
"The Man in the White Suit is one of those delightful comedies that Ealing studies made so well in the 40's and 50's. The plot of this one follows a man that invents a cloth that neither gets dirty nor breaks. Of course	 this is a huge breakthrough in the world of textiles. However	 things are not that simple as the cloth will threaten the way of life of many people	 including cloth manufacturers	 the cloth mill's workforces	 and even an old lady that does her washing every week. The Man in the White Suit is a film about scientific advances	 and the way that they don't always help; as the old woman says at one point in the movie	 ""Why cant you scientists just leave things alone?""<br /><br />Like a lot Ealing comedies	 this one stars Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor; he has the ability to light up the screen with his presence (and he does in this film	 literally)	 but he also manages to portray his characters in a down to earth and believable way. He is suitably creepy in this film	 and he captures just the right atmosphere for his character; an intelligent and ambitious	 but slightly naive scientist. Along with Guinness	 The Man in the White Suit also features Joan Greenwood	 the deep voiced actress that co-starred with Guinness in the simply divine ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" and Michael Gough	 a man that would go on to get himself the role of Alfred in the Batman films. The acting in the film isn't always great	 but it is always decent	 and it's fits with the film.<br /><br />The Man in the White Suit is an intelligent	 thought-provoking and witty comedy with a moral. The comedy isn't always obvious	 and it doesn't always work	 but the film is not meant to be a film that provokes belly laughs	 so that is forgivable. I recommend this movie	 basically	 to anyone that is a fan of movies."	1.0
"Is there anything worse than a comedy film that lacks humor? The answer is Yes; one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture. The premise is not too bad - a naive front man for an illegal business - but this is a potboiler with a poor script and screenplay and just does not work.<br /><br />Was this considered a good 'B' in 1942? Hard to imagine. The only positive aspect of the picture is the cast	 which contains several well-known faces from the '30's and '40's	 such as Warren Hymer	 Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always dismiss Richard Cromwell as the weakling who got Gary Cooper killed in ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer""	 so I wasn't counting him).<br /><br />Can't recommend this one and gave it a rating of 3 - if you have a choice	 get a root canal."	0.0

"Before I give Spike Lee's mess of a film SUMMER OF SAM a well-deserved thrashing	 I would like to make one thing clear. I do not revile this film simply for its abundance of sleazy and unpleasant images. What makes this film so unwatchable is the fact that Lee seems to believe that SUMMER OF SAM should be taken seriously as a socially enlightening drama. The crime caper films of Quentin Tarantino	 for example	 are filled with violence	 profanity	 and other sleaze	 but are nonetheless highly watchable because Tarantino does not attempt to pass these films off as socially redeeming works of art. He knows that such films are for entertainment value only. On the other hand	 serious dramas such as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and SCHINDLER'S LIST are often unpleasant to watch	 but the unpleasantness serves to develop the film's plot and characters	 with the end goal of getting the audience emotionally involved with the story and characters onscreen. SUMMER OF SAM	 unfortunately	 merely wallows in its own sensationalism and sleaze	 while believing that it is serving as social commentary	 much like other trash epics .<br /><br />SUMMER OF SAM does not serve as a serious drama because its characters are merely cardboard-cutout stereotypes. Its plot purports to show the emotional impact of the hysteria over the Son of Sam murders on the residents of the predominately Italian-American north Bronx neighborhood where the murders ocurred. However	 instead of of presenting the locals as a diverse mix of personalities	 Lee simply wheels out every negative Italian stereotype imaginable. The men are ignorant	 lazy	 oversexed goombahs. The women are split between weak	 complacent ""good girls"" (Mira Sorvino's Dionna) and promiscuous ""bad girls"" (Jennifer Esposito's Ruby). Lee seems to vindictively wants to ""payback"" Hollywood for their years of negative African-American stereotyping by wheeling out stereotypes of his own	 and few critics seem to care. If Martin Scorsese	 for example	 presented residents of an African-American neighborhood as a bunch of Amos 'n Andy and Aunt Jemima stereotypes	 critics would rightfully condemn such blatant stereotyping. More importantly	 one-dimensional	 stereotypical characters undermine any film that attempts to be a serious social commentary.<br /><br />Without exception	 the cast of SUMMER OF SAM is excellent. However	 the acting	 for the most part	 is uninspired. The cast is either just going through the motions	 or they have little to work with scriptwise. Additionally	 there is notable miscasting. Comedian John Leguizamo is very talented	 but his Vinny character seems to be a stale	 comedic impersonation of John Travolta's Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER. And Michael Badalucco	 a perennial ""nice guy"" actor	 is badly miscast as serial killer David Berkowitz	 coming across as funny rather than frightening. The only performance worth paying attention to is Adrien Brody as the troubled	 but sincere	 neighborhood misfit Ritchie. The Brody performance and the typically stylish Lee cinematography are this film's only virtues.<br /><br />*1/2 out of ****"	0.0

"Expecting a combination of scifi and period film about Ada Lovelace	 Charles Babbage	 the history of computers	 etc	 I was disappointed by this movies nonsensical pseudoscience and mixture of real and fabulous history. It gives the impression that its writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has no real understanding of the Math	 technology	 or history constituting the film's subject	 but is working instead from a sort of fuzzy artistic impression of them. This hits a sore spot with me	 as I've long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to glom onto and awfully misuse science terms and ideas to the point of confusion	 eg: Emmy Coer: ""information waves have a half-life""	 Ada: ""I'm not at all certain that half a life is better than no life at all"".<br /><br />This movie does worse than fail to entertain - it misinforms. The only redeeming value I can imagine for it is that it might attract a viewer to learn about the subject it so badly distorts. It's more likely	 I think	 to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement as indistinguishable from magic."	0.0
"What we have here is a film about how the pursuit of money & revenge can corrupt your soul... or something like that. Guy Ritchie	 a director known for his reworking of the gangster genre	 bites off more than he can chew with this one.<br /><br />His use of modern film noir to tackle the theme of a man setting himself free by swallowing his pride	 being nice to his enemy & giving away all his money falls flat on it's face. When Jason Statham's character no longer fears Ray Liotta	 it apparently drives Liotta crazy enough to blow his head off in the final scene. Why? Basically you cannot set up a mafiosi like the Liotta character	 who has presumably got to his station in life by displaying the kind of ruthless behaviour evident throughout the film	 only then to have him driven to suicide by nothing more than a pitying smile on the face of Statham's character.<br /><br />Before anyone starts to say I'm missing the point... I'm not. I get it OK? Opt out of the quest for riches & you'll find true happiness and inner peace. Be nice to your enemy and this will confuse him into self-destruction. This seems to be the gist of the movie and in itself this is not a bad premise for a story	 although hardly original. The problem is that Ritchie simply doesn't have the skill as a movie maker to carry it off. At the moment when even Guy Ritchie realises this	 he appears to get bored with the story and begins to insert red-herrings: The scene when Statham gets knocked over by a car - Why? The shooting of some scenes as Marvel comic animations... again	 why?<br /><br />There are so many loose threads & unanswered questions left at the end of the movie you could get all 2001-ish about it and try figuring them out	 or simply accept that there are no answers & each viewer will interpret things in their own way. Myself? I was so bored with the pompous tone of the film that I simply didn't care. Frankly the ending couldn't come too soon so that I didn't have to sit through any more of this pretentious psychobabble.<br /><br />A waste of two hours of my life."	0.0
"When I was young I had seen very few movies. My parents in all their wisdom rented this one. I was very wary of what the movie was about	 in fact I wasn't even allowed to watch it. My brother and sister got to of course and this made me very angry. So what did I do? Late at night I trashed the VCR! Kicked the screen of the TV in and called the police and reported vandals. I was arrested of course	 I was unable to get my foot out of the TV set before the police arrived. I was only given a stern talking to and sent home. My parents grounded me of course and made me work to repay the debt for the TV and VCR. This tore me apart	 slave labour really sucks believe me	 but I had to do it. Chores all around the house. What happened in the end? We got a big screen TV	 DVD player and a surround sound system for my work. How did I get the money? Easy I made movies of my own and sold them to Disney! Do you remember Finding Neno? Well I wrote that movie and filmed my goldfish in their fish tanks! They rewrote the plot of course and did it in CGI because they couldn't afford to make it a real life action picture like I had done! In the end I never saw the film The Head that didn't die and the rating I gave it is my life rating! It's doing pretty good!"	1.0
"For me	this is one of the best movies i ever saw.Overcoming racism	struggling through life and proving himself he isn't just an ordinary ""cookie"" 	Carl Brashear is an amazing character to play 	who puts Cuba in his best light	best performance in his life.De Niro	who is a living legend gives THAT SOMETHING to the movie.Hated his character in movie	but he gives so much good acting to this film	great performance.And appearance of beautiful Charlize was and as always is a big plus for every movie. So if you haven't seen this movie i highly recommended for those who love bravery	greatness who seek inspiration.You must look this great drama. My Vote 9/10."	1.0
"Terminus Paradis was exceptional	 but ""Niki ardelean"" comes too late. We already have enough of this and we want something new.<br /><br />Big directors should have no problems seeing beyond their time	 not behind. Why people see Romania only as a postrevolutionary country?<br /><br />We are just born not reincarnated	 and nobody gives a s**t anymore about old times. Most people dont remember or dont want to remember	 and the new generation of movie consumers dont understand a bit. This should be the first day of romanian movie not the final song - priveghi! Maybe younger directors should make the move."	0.0
"This Italian film from the '70's is NOT even in the class with Dog Soldiers	 The Howling	 or even that awful American Werewolf in Paris	 BUT...it is fun to watch. I'm talking about watching the lead actress	 a stunning blonde	 run amok in her birthday suit. We're talking about graphic	 complete nudity...it's obvious that she is a real blonde...humma humma humma!! The story is a hoot	 the SFX are childish	 and the acting (for the most part) stinks. The only redeeming value of this movie is all (and there is a LOT) the nudity & sex scenes. Tame by HBO standards	 but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night. OK...HERE'S THE SPOILER...There is NO werewolf (except in the opening scene of the heroine(??)'s ancestor. The girl just imagines that she's a werewolf...in other words	 a clinical Lycanthrope."	0.0
"As a fan of Science-fiction movies	 I have been aware of The Matrix since its release in 1999. From the little bit I would allow people to tell me about it	 I assumed it was highly original and sophisticated. I am also a devotee of Alice in Wonderland. I could never quite figure out how I missed The Matrix when it was released. With the imminent release of The Matrix Reloaded	 it was time to buy the DVD and watch it.<br /><br />The disappointment was too great. The premise of the matrix (the controlling device as opposed to the movie) was clever. The philosophical premise of parallel worlds	 alternate realities is shopworn. However	 I could still have bought into the film	 as science-fiction	 if it stayed firmly in that genre. Unfortunately	 it turned into a standard	 ""will they or won't they escape	 break through	 rescue those in need of rescue	 etc."" To make matters worse	 it turned out to be another martial arts exercise. The problem is that science-fiction and martial arts films are really two different types. To the purest	 the devotee of one or the other	 mixing the two doesn't work. It is like mixing science-fiction with romance. You can have one or the other	 but not both in the same film	 or	 at least	 not both to the same extent in the same movie.<br /><br />If there were such problems with The Matrix	 The Matrix Reloaded really compounded the problems. At least thirty minutes of the film were either martial arts sequences or the protracted car-chase. (This observation ignores the question	 made in every professional	 negative review of the movie: If Neo could do the Superman thing	 why bother to fight at all? The answer	 of course	 is that's what draws the young	 male demographic group into the theatre.) Then there is the ""redemption through love"" aspect. That plot device was worn out by Richard Wagner over a hundred years ago. It was actually handled better by him in Die Gotterdammerung.<br /><br />So where does that leave those who saw the Matrix Reloaded. Martial arts fans probably groaned through the trite	 but arcane sci-fi philosophizing. Science fictions fans were wondering why they were sitting through a kung-fun fest. Most of the males in the audience where probably bored by the silly romance aspect of the film.<br /><br />Just what are you supposed to be getting for your bucks when you see The Matrix franchise films: Science fiction	 martial arts	 or soap opera? A bit of each does not make for a whole lot more of any of them	 nor for a satisfying film for the afficionados of each."	0.0
"In a movie that follows a struggling actor	 played	 evidently	 by a struggling actor	 this does no favours for Chris Klein. He struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and meanders on through the shallow script managing to display	 what could only be described as	 a bland leading man. The story exists	 but that is all	 and fails to show any basic start	 middle and end and the viewer is left shrugging his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really happened.<br /><br />One bright light in the midst of this is Fred Durst	 who manages to stand out above his seemingly averagely talented co-stars and does a semi-decent job of bringing the backward character of Legde to life. Whether Fred can re-create this when working with a higher calibre of cast remains to be seen but I'l be watching out for him in future."	0.0
"And how it made it into production astounds me. The main character is an obnoxious show off who isn't the least bit funny. I can't stand the character at all. He's a dumb ass with nothing to offer the show. <br /><br />This is the worst cartoon to surface in the last 10 years	 no joke. The story lines are both poorly written and executed. The jokes are as bad as the ones on Disney's Sweet Life of Zack and Cody. I could not dislike this show more	 it's terrible and should be canceled. Even the theme song is bad. The title	 even worse.<br /><br />It's as though this show is written by a couple of 15 year olds that based the character on themselves and think they're hot stuff when they're really just arrogant and lack creativity as well as humor.<br /><br />Johnny Test	 go away far and fast!"	0.0
"I have read the short story by Norman Maclean	 and the movie did justice to Norman Maclean's writing. My husband tends to reread it occasionally	 and I myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind. We have videos of many of Redford s movies and we have watched ""A River runs through it"" many times. Redford is part of the ""famdamily"" as he is always around. We never get tired of Redford's perception of Norman Maclean writings	 and the beauty of Montana. The script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as Mr. Maclean's father. According to ""A River Runs Through It	"" ""Methodists are Baptists who can read	"" a line which by the way is not in the short story	 but I think that is a funny line! My husband and I are well-read Baptists!<br /><br />I have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow. I disagree. As one search for inner peace	 this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in three/four rhythm of the metronome. The photography is outstanding! The acting is great. I love the scene where Norman and Paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer! Then as adult Paul played by Brad Pitt (Se7ven) is the ""perfect guy"" who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it. The same applies to Neal Burns	 who uses worms as bait	 he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help. The scene where Paul refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace! Finally after hours	 they all kneel around the table to say: ""Grace!"" and they all leave. But the oatmeal stayed on the plate! That scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors! That is funny! The sunburn! The drive back home where Jessie Burns (Emily Lloyd) decides to go via the train line! Beautiful dialogue when Norman proposes to Jessie because he wants her to come to Chicago with him!<br /><br />Redford himself does a superb job as a narrator. I could not stop myself from comparing Brad to the young Redford (Barefoot in the Park). The nominated Director	 Producer	 Actor	 is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not only in the cinema in the US but around the world. I am glad to live in nineteen hundred because I have seen the beginning of the black and white television	 the movies and all the technology and special effects	 to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as Redford because I have had the chance to see his works. Redford needs no special effects to show us the beauty of Montana in this masterpiece. The river to me means that line that separates life from death	 memories and realities. Redford shows the hands of the Creator so magnificently and a river runs through it."	1.0
"""Purple Rain"" has never been a critic's darling but it is a cult classic - and deserves to be. If you are a Prince fan this is for you.<br /><br />The main plot is Prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and him falling in love with a girl. Believe it or not this movie isn't just singing and dancing. There are many intense scenes and it is heartwarming. Sometimes it comes off has funny but when it works it really works. Very hit and miss.<br /><br />No one can really act in the film. Everyone is from one of Prince's side acts like ""The Time"" and ""Vanity 6"". Still	 it adds charm to the movie. When ever Prince is on screen he lights it up and it fun to see him at his commercial peak. <br /><br />In conclusion	 go and see this if you love Prince like me. If you aren't a fan it'll make you one."	1.0
"Sogo Ishii can be a skilled filmmaker under the right conditions	 but Gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival	 a scion of the Genji clan. The film-making has the main hallmarks of a low-budget production	 including blurry fight scenes and clumsy montages (the kind you might find in an under-produced dorama). The monk Benkei informs his spiritual teacher that his destiny lies in defeating the mysterious spirit that guards Gojoe bridge at night	 but he doesn't realize that this decision will bring him squarely into conflict with nearly every element of society at that time - but which could earn him enlightenment. <br /><br />There's no absence of ambitiousness	 however	 in its depiction of the conflict between the holy and the worldly. Artsy flourishes in some of the photography and editing help to compensate for the loose film-making style. <br /><br />A disappointment."	0.0
"This film was made and cast from my home town. I remember the fuss about it and the whole hullabaloo about the fact Molly Ringwald was in town...<br /><br />Storyline...<br /><br />Essentially 20 years after a film was ""laid to rest"" without being finished	 a group of film students set out to complete it - with dire consequences. It would seem someone does not want the film completed.<br /><br />The storyline is flimsy. One has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little tounge in cheek	 but it had no real oomph. The characters are mostly transperant and the little info that you recieve about them you just don't care about	 it seems irrelevant. It is weird hearing Kylie's accent as Australian again and nice to see a kid I went to school with in a starring role. But that doesn't redeem the film at all. Goodness knows why the makers thought they would get in Molly Ringwald. Perhaps due to the nature of the film (it sort of pays homage to 80s films / bad horror films)but really an Aussie actor would have done just fine.<br /><br />As far as casting is concerned a lot of the acting seemed constipated. Some of these kids (especially the two main chics - they played ""director"" and ""producer"") looked like they were trying to act. That is never a good look. Also	 the shots had a rough feel about them. Over lit perhaps? Just not as smooth as one is used to.<br /><br />The killer. Lord. Could it be less frightening? There are some shock factors though	 and a couple of gross scenes. I did like the film	 but it was not great. It went for 90 minutes but could have gone for less. Perhaps if they had tightened the script it would have been better. They had a lot of characters get killed - but no real build up to them getting slayed. Maybe if they had killed less people and actually concentrated on a scary atmosphere it would have been better.<br /><br />Now I know it is a comedy and elements were funny. Or so unbelieveable they were funny. But I am not convinced.<br /><br />LM."	0.0
from the start of this movie you soon become aware that the name of the film has nothing to do with the movie itself from watching a naked woman being chased by people in very silly masks to servants running round in the worst clothing I've ever seen and all this in subtitles makes this the kind of movie you should think twice about seeing and as the film slowly moves along you soon realise that the vampire is not a vampire you got to wonder where the title came from some parts of the film made a bit of sense with Pierre and is father but as the film gets to its really silly ending you have got to think why end a film this way and surly they had a better ending if only in there heads this is not a film to watch basically	0.0
"First of all	 when people hear 'GUY RITCHIE'	 they immediately think of SNATCH. Yes	 Snatch was a good movie	 but the problem is that everyone associates Guy Ritchie to Snatch. They don't expect him to explore new frontiers. This movie REVOLVER is different than snatch; it's much darker and is very complex. The reason I gave a rating of 10 is because I've had to watch Revolver 3 times to understand everything. So this movie toys with your head. It's very cleverly written.<br /><br />This movie is different than Snatch. It was done wonderfully	 the cinematography is beautiful	 and you can recognize Guy Ritchie's personal touch (style of directing) in it.<br /><br />What won me over was the complexity of the protagonist and how we are left with more questions than answers."	1.0
"It's funny how your life can change in a second... To attend ''The Waterdance'' for the first time it was an unforgettable experience	 the way you need to get used to a new way of life it can seem frightening	 and to notice that there are other people going by a similar situation it can help you to go on. <br /><br />Eric Stoltz's performances and mainly of Helen Hunt (oh man!	 Helen is the purest and graceful woman in earth...) are wonderful	 Wesley Snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles. A film simple and at the same time deep that doesn't get to leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted: enjoy each moment of your life...<br /><br />Really to a film as that the any hour is not attended!!!

I thank god I didn't go to cinema for this film. I would be very sorry for the money I gave. I saw it on tv and I couldn't beleive my eyes.

"I never seem to write a review on IMDb unless I am extremely surprised at how good	 or how bad	 a movie is. This film falls into the first category. Every year	 I try to see all the nominees for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars	 even those that I know I won't like. ""As It Is In Heaven"" seems to fit the bill. The plot sounds sugary and sentimental and slow....For my tastes	 which run more towards original	 dark and/or daring foreign cinema (Michael Haneke	 Francois Ozon	 A lot of modern Japanese/Korean cinema) ""As It Is In Heaven"" does not sound particularly interesting....It didn't get released in the USA	 so I sat down to watch a VCD I found in Singapore	 preparing to ""cross it off the list"". After a dull beginning	 ""As It Is In Heaven"" becomes that rare film where you really become inspired by what is happening on screen. Weak points: The characters in the film are pure ""stock"" characters- the Wounded Dreamer	 the Town Bully	 the Battered Wife	 the Loose Woman Yearning for Love	 the Repressed Minister....Thankfully	 they're largely a likable bunch	 as well as being well-written and well-acted. Ingela Olsson	 as the minister's wife Inger	 would have been nominated for an Oscar had her performance been in English. Strong points: the music is beautiful	 and the main song	 sung by Gabriella	 is truly dramatic and memorable. And keep an eye out for the feisty 87-year old actress playing Olga	 who is keeping up with the dancing steps as well as the younger ladies! I won't discuss the ending	 but I will say that it makes sense. They're are a lot of emotional things happening in the last hour of the film	 and you're not quite sure why they're happening. Although nothing is explained in words	 it all makes sense as the movies comes to a fitting crescendo. **** out of *****. Probably the strongest Swedish movie I've ever seen."	1.0
"I can't believe this is on DVD. Even less it was available at my local video store.<br /><br />Some argue this is a good movie if you take in consideration it had only a 4000$ budget. I find this funny. I would find it very bad whichever the budget.<br /><br />Still more funny	 I read the following in another review: ""Dramatics aside	 if you love horror and you love something along the lines of Duel (1971) updated with a little more story and some pretty girls thrown in	 you'll love this movie.""<br /><br />What?!? This is a shame comparing those two movies.<br /><br />I give a ""1""	 since I can't give a ""0"". I just don't see any way this movie could be entertaining."	0.0
"This is exactly the sort of Saturday matinee serial I loved during World War II. I was under ten years of age. And that's the audience this serial is designed for. Looking at it now	 one must roar at its ineptitude and stupidity. The budget must have been next to nothing	 given the shortcuts and repeats. The acting? Well	 this is Republic pictures	 1944. They read the lines....and no doubt had one take to make them convincing.<br /><br />One and half stars."	0.0
"Lawrence Olivier and Merle Oberon did two movies together within two years. One is considered one of the great romantic films of all time	 and the movie that made Olivier a great movie star (and gave Oberon her best performance role): WUTHERING HEIGHTS. The other is this film	 made in England a year earlier. THE DIVORCE OF LADY X is a romantic comedy (as WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a romantic tragedy). Olivier is a lawyer	 Everard Logan	 who is a dynamic barrister	 but is also a total misogynist. One night he checks into a hotel just ahead of a crowd of people. It is a very foggy night (the type of pea soup fog that London was known for up until a notorious ""killer"" fog in the 1950s)	 and the crowd (who'd been attending a party in the hotel) need beds. The management tries to get Logan to allow one or two socialite ladies to sleep on a couch and a day bed in his rooms	 but he refuses. But he has not reckoned with Merle Oberon as Leslie Steele. The granddaughter of a high court judge	 she manages to get into Logan's rooms and manipulates him to not only agree to her sleeping there	 but appropriates his bed (he goes onto the couch - much to his discomfort).<br /><br />The next day they share a breakfast	 and in the smalltalk it is evident that despite his mistrust of women Logan finds Leslie very attractive. But she kittenishly refuses to tell him her name. She is determined to learn more about him	 and she finds his attitude toward women infuriating. In the meantime	 Logan is approached by a wealthy nobleman (Ralph Richardson as Lord Mere) as a potential client. Mere suspects his wife Lady Mere (Binnie Barnes) of having an affair. In fact	 he tells Logan her Ladyship was with her lover in the hotel that Logan knows he was in on the night of the fog. Logan (naturally) jumps to the conclusion that Lady Mere was his mysterious roommate that night. I will not go into the plot any further	 except to say that Leslie eventually realizes what a mistake Logan has made	 and decides to use it to teach him a lesson about women.<br /><br />The script has the feel of a Wodehouse novel	 but is slighter. Still the performances of Olivier	 Oberon	 Richardson	 Barnes	 and Morton Selden (as Oberon's grandfather) are all splendid. It shows what a good cast can do with even the slightest of materials. Take a look at some of the minor scenes to see what I mean: Selden's first scene	 complaining about his weak coffee to his butler/valet	 who tells him off properly (they've been used to each other's personalities for years). Or Olivier dealing with a young clerk in his office	 who is certain there were two Lady Meres in the office two minutes before (there were	 but Oberon and Barnes left together)	 and ends up thinking the poor clerk is a simpleton. Or the waiter in the hotel who can't understand why the tenant in Olivier's room is constantly changing from a man to a woman to a man. As I said	 a slight charming comedy - but it is very charming."	1.0
"Firstly	I must admit that it isn't a good movie. And	I would never watch this movie if Pacino wasn't in it.<br /><br />The movie is about a publicist's strange 24 hours.And he is overworked	dizzy	sick and sometimes regretful.I don't like the character at all.It's really boring	after 20 minutes you may fall asleep.And I don't understand why Pacino wanted to be a part of this horrible movie.Just because of money or what?<br /><br />Since I'm an avid Pacino fan	I bought this 2002 movie People I Know.If you haven't bought it yet	don't even think about it	it's just a waste of time."	0.0

"What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast	 but somewhere the movie loses it. Actually	 it never really got going. There was a little excitement when we find out that Angie is not really pregnant	 then find out that she is after all	 but that was it. Steve Martin	 who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie	 was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie	 other than to make it longer. I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters	 Kate and Angie	 and maybe try not for a pure comedy	 which unfortunately it was not	 but maybe a drama with comedic elements. I think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here I can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot."	0.0
"BEWARE SPOILERS. This movie was okay. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the best two in it. Okay	 so the goofie foreign guy who (SPOILER HERE) trades with the biker for his clothes was funny.

Romantic	 sweet	 yummy.<br /><br />Hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians. To talk about Sarandon would be to give a lot away.

Oh	 I just read where I need to write at least ten lines. Here's my other main issue with the film. Kim Bassinger was too vapid and not at all what I pictured from the book. I know	 the book was the book and the movie; well not so good. I found the character in the book much more empathetic. Also the book evoked rustic	 almost primitive images of the monastery.

OK its not the best film I've ever seen but at the same time I've been able to sit and watch it TWICE!!! story line was pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story i wondered what the hell i was watching but at the same time it was so awful i loved it cheap laughs all the way.<br /><br />And Jebidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name calling.<br /><br />overall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it.	0.0
"1st watched 8/26/2001 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Tobe Hooper): Scary	 yet sadistic(which makes sense) portrayal of a relative of the Marquis De Sade carrying out the same sadistic acts and enjoying it that supposedly his predecessor did. This Tobe Hooper film really doesn't do a whole lot different than his similar in style Freddy Krueger movies with the same star (Freddy himself - Robert Englund) playing a dual role(the Marquis De Sade and his relative). It is also seems like it wants to really poke at Christianity but then loses that in the end much to my chagrin but leaving an inconsistent feel to the movie. Could have been much worse if excesses were taken in sex and violence	 but they try to keep this at a minimal despite some disgusting scenes. My final thought is why would Hooper want to make this movie. It obviously took awhile to actually get distributed	 then it has to be advertised gruesomely and with Hooper's name in the title to hopefully make some money on his name and his gore. It's obvious this didn't work."	0.0
"When i saw the preview for this on TV i was thinking	 ""ok its gonna be a good werewolf movie"" but it was not. it was not scary at all! acting was good	 plot was horrible	 the military bid was just plain stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel could of done better than this piece of crap. The movie made it sound like Arron was going to turn into a werewolf	 instead he turned psycho and bit some doctor's throat out. If you have read some of my other reviews on other movies	 there all positive	 but this one is not simply because the story was terrible. One out of 10 max. Im sure you all were expecting some werewolf flick	 but i bet you didn't expect this. Beyond Loch Nes was way better than this movie	 heck	 any movie thats on the sci-fi channel is better than this movie."	0.0
"CAMILLE 2000 <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (Panavision)<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />Whilst visiting Rome	 an amorous nobleman (Nino Castelnuovo) falls in love with a beautiful young libertine (Daniele Gaubert)	 but their unlikely romance is opposed by Castelnuovo's wealthy father (Massimo Serato)	 and Fate deals a tragic blow...<br /><br />A sexed-up love story for the swinging Sixties	 adapted from a literary source (Alexandre Dumas' 'La Dame aux Camelias') by screenwriter Michael DeForrest	 and directed with freewheeling flair by Radley Metzger who	 along with the likes of Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno	 is credited with redefining the parameters of 'Adult' cinema throughout the 1960's and 70's. Using the scope format for the last time in his career	 Metzger's exploration of 'la dolce vita' is rich in visual excess (note the emphasis on reflective surfaces	 for example)	 though the film's sexual candor seems alarmingly coy by modern standards. Production values are handsome throughout	 and the performances are engaging and humane (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable)	 despite weak post-sync dubbing. Though set in an unspecified future	 Enrico Sabbatini's wacked-out set designs locate the movie firmly within its period	 and Piero Piccioni's 'wah-wah' music score has become something of a cult item amongst exploitation devotees. Ultimately	 CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste	 but fans of this director's elegant softcore erotica won't be disappointed. Next up for Metzger was THE LICKERISH QUARTET (1970)	 which many consider his best film."	0.0
"Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not provide the right chemistry here in this 1945 film.<br /><br />There is a good story here about the Axis trying to obtain coal to use for the upcoming war. Unfortunately	 this part of the story is not emphasized. Instead	 we deal with a supposedly bungling Boyer. By the way	 Bacall is as British as Vladimir Putin.<br /><br />The real acting kudos goes to veteran Oscar winner Katina Paxinou. As was the case with her memorable Pilar in the 1943 Oscar winner	 ""For Whom the Bell Tolls	"" Paxinou again plays a Spanish revolutionary but this time she is a double-crossing counter-spy for the pro-Franco group. She is quite a vicious character here;especially	 when she throws a 14 year old child out the window. She believed that Boyer had given the child important material to hide."	0.0
"This will not likely be voted best comedy of the year	 a few too many coincidences and plot holes. However we are talking about a movie where a hit-man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. Brosnan is excellent in this role	 gone is the wooden James Bond (a role he was wasted in). If he can maintain this kind of quality I hope he continues to make comedies. Greg Kinnear is also excellent as Brosnan's straight man. I've read a few negative comments in here about Hope Davis but I thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within. There are lots of good chuckles as Brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where I nearly died laughing. My father (a consultant) nearly lost it when Julian describes himself as a ""facilitator"". Much like ""Grosse Pointe Blank""	 another hit-man comedy	 the humour can be very dark. If you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself."	1.0
"It is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today. maybe I am a dinosaur from the fifties	 and I am out of touch with todays movie going generation	 and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie	 since so many people loved it. I found it foul and vulgar. I haven't said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill. The humor is sophomoric and crude. I am not a politically correct person	 and even I found the gay jokes	 not only not funny but downright offensive ( I'm not gay). The main character in the movie is not even a likable person	 just pathetic. When the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see."	0.0
"even though this movie is quite old	 no matter how many times i watch it	 it still makes me laugh. <br /><br />one particular quote in the movie stands out. <br /><br />when Danny( Joe Piscopo) pulls up to the d.a's office & parks in a disabled spot	 Danny's partner says <br /><br />"" can't park here	 it's for the handicapped"". <br /><br />Danny replies "" i am handicapped	i'm psychotic"".<br /><br />that is one of the many lines in the movie that no matter how many times you watch	 it'll make you chuckle.<br /><br />Johnny Dangerously stands in my top 5 comedy/spoof movies of all time.<br /><br />As an added bonus it also includes the legendary actor Peter Boyle in the cast. So watch this movie & like myself & many others who have watched it	 you'll be hooked."	1.0
"OK	 I overrated it just a bit to offset at least one of those grumpy reviews. But I did enjoy it. I didn't laugh out loud	 but it held my interest and pulled me along without dropping me at any point. The story built. Yeah	 you knew it would have an happy ending--this genre always does. Meantime	 it was quirky with sight gags you could miss	 so pay attention when you watch. Stiller and Black delivered expertly yet again. Good team. They should work together more. Don't know that it will be a cult classic	 but it was certainly a fun ride. Not as good as WHAT ABOUT BOB	 or DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS but what is? It is still worth going out of your way a little to get and watch this movie."	1.0
"Does any one know what the 2 sports cars were? I think Robert Stack's might have been a Masseratti.Rock Hudson's character told his father he was taking a job in Iraq 	isn't that timely? I have had Dorthy Malone in my spank bank most of my life 	maybe this was the film that impressed me.Loren Bacall sure did have some chops in this film and probably out-acted Malone but Malones's part made a more sensational impact so she got the Oscar for best supporting role.Was Loren's part considered a leading role?Old man Hadley character was was probably a pretty common picture of tycoons of his era in that he was a regular guy who made it big in an emerging industry but in building a whole town he had forgotten his children to have his wife bring them up.In time	being widowed he realized that they were all he really had and they were spoiled rotten	looking for attention	so rather than try to relate to his children he blew his head off.An ancient morality tale.But seriously	what were those sports cars?"	1.0
"Three horror stories based on members of a transgressive Hindu cult that return home but changed in some way. In the first story our former cult member is now in an insane asylum and is visited by a reported who wants to find out about what went on at the cult. Somewhat slow going as story is told in flashbacks while the two sit on chairs and face each other. Reporter is particularly interested in what lead to the death of the participants. What seemed rather boring suddenly turns very exciting with a surprising twist in the story. Things get quite bloody.<br /><br />Second story has a violent young criminal visiting a psychiatrist for mandatory therapy. The patient seems to have some type of agenda but the psychiatrist is up to the task. Again	 things slow down a bit and get weird. Then there's a strange twist in the story that is very well written and surprising.<br /><br />Final story deals with spiritual healer who claims to be able to remove the persons illness from them with his hands. One of the patients is a former cult member	 so the successful healing gets more complicated. Again	 we are surprised by a twist. Has a pretty gory scene in there.<br /><br />There some nice female full frontal nudity as well as male full frontal nudity for some reason. I found the stories to be very well written and the director succeeds entirely in setting up each story with its surprising twist and the gory aftermath.<br /><br />Note: review of the German DVD."	1.0
"Im gonna make this short and sweet because i don't think there is much you can really tell someone about this show who has never seen it other than its hilariously funny and unique	 for me its possibly the funniest show ever.<br /><br />You have to really watch it to understand its humour and it took me a few episodes to really get into it but once your in there is no getting back out. For example the way Hydes character always wants to see his friends get in some sort of trouble the more it happens the funnier it becomes.<br /><br />Its all round classic I mean the cast	 the writers	 the director	 its just a recipe for success. One actor i think who always gets a hard time is Ashton Kutcher but i mean he's great in this show i don't think its possible for the the character Kelso to have been played by anyone else	 it takes someone very smart to play someone that stupid. All the main characters are great and it wouldn't be a worth while review if i didn't mention the stone cold fox Mila Kunis	 now thats a spicy meet a ball ha ha all joking aside amazing show."	1.0
"I first watched the Walking Tall movies when I was about 8 years old and I thought both Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a great job	 they must have anyway because since watching the movies	 I have tried to learn as much about the real Sheriff Buford Pusser as I can. All 3 parts of the movie gave me chills and Buford Pusser was a true hero	 I only wish he were alive today and that there were more people like him. I would love to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave. I am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain. My heart goes out to them. So from a 30 year old fan of Sheriff Pusser and of the 3-part Walking Tall movies and the actors that portrayed him	 please do not be negative about these movies and actors	 they were only trying to let us know what a wonderful man the real Buford Pusser was and what a great family he had. And to all the young people who may have not heard much about Buford	 I suggest you watch the Walking Tall movies and learn more about him."	1.0
"I'm usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching	 but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance. The only true upside to this film is Cornelia Sharpe	 looking rather attractive	 and the fact that this film is REALLY short.<br /><br />The plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film. None of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone. I'm not sure why on earth Sean Connery agreed to do this film	 but he should have definitely passed on this one.<br /><br />The only reason I could see for seeing this film is if you are a die-hard Sean Connery fan and simply want to see everything he's done. Save this one for last though.<br /><br />Well	 if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review (or any of the other reviews on this site)	 then I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thanks for reading."	0.0
"I was 15 years old when this movie premiered on the television. Being raised in Texas	 I understood the boredom & monotony of teenage life there. This movie touched my impressionable teenage heart & I remembered it fondly through the past 12 years. I recently got to see it for the 2nd	 3rd & 4th times thanks the the LOVE channel. I still cry because the movie reaches in & touches my inner confused teenager."	1.0
"Nifty little episode played mainly for laughs	 but with clever dollop of suspense. Somehow a Martian has snuck aboard a broken-down bus on its way to nowhere	 but which passenger is it	 (talk about your illegal immigrants!). All-star supporting cast	 from wild-eyed Jack Elam (hamming it up shamelessly)	 to sexy Jean Willes (if she's the Martian	 then I say let's open the borders!)	 to cruel-faced John Hoyt (the most obvious suspect)	 along with familiar faces John Archer and Barney Phillips (and a nice turn from Bill Kendis as the bus driver). Makes for a very entertaining half-hour even if the action is confined to a single set."	1.0
"I've always thought that most huge box-office flops usually have something to recommend them	 but after the remake of Around the World in 80 Days and Thunderbirds	 I'm beginning to doubt it. For those not familiar	 it's based on a puppet show about a family of astronauts who use state of the art rockets	 spaceships and subs to rescue people from various disasters (falling bridges	 stricken planes	 burning buildings	 etc) each week. Well	 the puppets are gone (replaced by far more lifeless teenagers)	 and so is the premise - only one ineptly staged rescue and a plot shamelessly ripped off from Spy Kids without any signs of imagination	 wit or entertainment. Young Alan Tracey feels left out of all the rescuing we never see the other Traceys do because dad won't let him play with a real rocket until he passes his exams. Grounded on a beautiful tropical island (some punishment!)	 his chance to shine comes when the rest of the family - a bunch of identikit bleach-blondes who look like a gay neo-Nazi boy band without a single bit of characterisation between them - are stranded in space and he has to have the day by	 er	 running around the jungle	 making a phone call	 firing a hose at the inept comedy relief villains and dousing them in gunk for bad measure.<br /><br />The good points are few and far between. One of them is that the film is mostly in focus. The other is they all got to go to the Seychelles	 which looks nice.<br /><br />The bad points: where to start? Ben Kingsley's career lowpoint performance? The aforementioned inept comedy relief sidekicks who would disgrace the Children's Film Foundation at its worst? The almost complete lack of action or effects in a $70m sci-fi film? The terrible script	 the lifeless direction	 the odious moralising? But most of all is the fact that the film is so patronising in every possible way. Forget the life lessons and off the peg sentiment	 this is a movie aimed straight at the under-eights by people who know they're making a kid's movie and are constantly talking down to their intended audience	 throwing in fifth-rate jokes and routines that would insult most children who had only recently mastered the art of speech. This film could replace being sent to bed early without their dinner as parents' favourite punishment for kids.<br /><br />The biggest flop in British film history (it didn't even cover the cost of prints and marketing)	 it's just about watchable if only as an object lesson in how NOT to make a summer movie."	0.0
"We can start with the wooden acting but this film is a disaster. Having grown up in NY I can tell you that this film is an insult to anyone who is familiar with the community or the people. I'm not even a defender of the culture in any way and found this to be a Hollywoodized piece of trash to fit its own fictional	 ridiculous culture presentation and language that anyone who watches Seinfeld knows is inaccurate. This is a colossal waste of time and	 even worse	 is not exactly interesting since the outcome is obvious and the scenes of confrontation are laughably bad. Who acts this way? Nobody.<br /><br />The writer's name sounds Israeli or something of that nature but it is clear he doesn't have a clue about the subject he is writing about. Looking at his bio	 it is shocking he lived in New York and wonder how much real connection he had with the community. Even mediocre films like ""A Stranger Among Us"" are better and more closer to the truth than this dreck. Reading this guy's credits it's no wonder he has written scripts on all C grade films that somehow feature stars. shocking. Perhaps he knows someone because this script is even below par for a bad Dolph Lundgren film."	0.0
"this is without a doubt the worst most idiotic horrible piece o' crap i have ever watched.<br /><br />this movies plot is that some guy goes crazy and dresses up as santa claus and kills people BECAUSE he saw his mother give his father oral sex while he was dressed as santa clause. THAT IS WHY HE WENT INSANE? is it just me or is that the worst damn reason for someone to go insane like EVER? and that's not the only thing. i'm being serious when I say NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS DAMN MOVIE. nothing until like 1 hour and 15 minutes of it have gone by.<br /><br />there's an entire friggin scene where he glues a friggin santa beard on to him. IT'S A FRIGGIN MINUTE LONG. WHO THE HELL WANTS TO SEE THAT? however i must say the ending of this movie made me crap myself laughing at it. so if you see this movie on TV or something come back in like 1 hour and 20 minutes just to watch without a doubt the worst ending in all of cinematic history. and i'm serious about that.<br /><br />it's not even so good its bad	 it's tedious	 it's idiotic	 it made me want to break the vcr. it's just not worth your time also i'm sure every other review mentioned this but The actress who played the mother on Home Improvement was in this movie for a split second. YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW BAD THIS MOVIE IS? I'D RATHER WATCH HOME IMPROVEMENT FOR SIXTY SIX HOURS THEN EVEN LOOK AT THIS MOVIES COVER EVER AGAIN."	0.0
"Not only was this the most expensive Canadian film ever shot in BC	 but easily the worst	 never seeing the light of day. The director is not even Canadian	 but British	 and boy does it show. We are all made out to be a bunch of over-sexed dope fiends and morons. The spirit of what it means to be Canadian is absent	 and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk. Of course the British character is normal. The rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype - can you say ""Norm!!""? The cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes. The actors always seem to be fidgetting. Are they as bored as the viewer	 or is this the directors idea of cinema? Avoid this mess and check out some of Bruce Mcdonalds films. A true Canadian boy with something original to say cinematically. You won't be compelled to walk out on HIS films after 10 minutes."	0.0
"This engaging (which it shouldn't be) low-grade Spanish exploitation (quite tame I might add) looks good	 but huh? Let me phrase that again 'huh?'. Actually the word 'huh?' would be going through your mind quite a lot. Nothing makes sense	 nor does it try too. I just don't know if its complicatedly cryptic or just a convoluted muddle	 but there's no denying how laconically uneventful	 strange and wordy it feels.<br /><br />Unrelated sequences tied (like that nasty opening involving a little girl	 dead cat and fire) in to a sparse story involving photographer Mario (played by a chest-puffing John Caffari	 who's mustache is a dead ringer for Nintendo's iconic Mario. What's the odds?) that ditches his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady (a gorgeously fixating Patty Shepard) who he asks to come with him on an photography assignment	 where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some hooded witches.<br /><br />Look past the unhinged plot structure and wallow in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease. Raul Artigot directs few jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages	 but for most part seems sporadically non-existent and unfocused just like his writing. Ramon Sempere's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away. However there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on. Fernando Garcia Morcillo's hauntingly bombastic and overwrought score blends terrifically with compulsively dense atmosphere created. The leads are capable	 but there's also a sturdy bunch (the pick being Víctor Israel) of secondary performances.<br /><br />Slow with little in the way of interest	 but this dreamy set-up (that seems to go on and on) manages to keep you watching until its closing."	0.0
"As a kid I remember being nine or ten and loving this movie. It was the all round Bollywood action/comedy movie. It is a imitation of Bad Boys obviously! The whole swapping identities but the arrival of two other twins throws everything out of the window and then the arrival of colourful villains who dance and sing! The action scenes in the film aren't revolutionary but still amazing scenes. The film is genuinely very funny and was the great comeback Amitabh Bachan needed. Govinda is a gem like always and this is probably his best work to date	 he shines as the side kick nd delivers the best comedy scenes available in Indian cinema.<br /><br />The songs....The songs are both funny and catchy..............proving laughs when you least expect it...Amitabh Bachan surprisingly is very funny and will make you laugh as 'Bade Miah'....his accent...body language..... Brilliant...<br /><br />'Assi chutki naab re daal' is the best song..............Hilarious."	1.0
"While I suppose this film could get the rap as being Anti-Vietnam	 while watching it I didn't feel that such was the case as much as the film was simply an honest look into the perspective of the young guys being trained for a war that the public didn't support.... it showed their fear	 their desperation	 their drive... all of it	 out in the open	 naked. As a soldier myself alot of the themes rang true to me in my experience in the military - especially boot camp. On the whole this movie	 although it was shot on a very small budget	 looks great	 is very well put together	 and features excellent acting and directing. I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for another excellent Colin Farrell film. 10/10"	1.0
"""A Family Affair"" takes us back to a less complicated time in America. It's sobering to see how different everything was back then. It was a more innocent era in our country and we watch a 'functional' family dealing in things together. The film also marks the beginning of the series featuring the Hardy family.<br /><br />The film	 directed by George Seitz	 is based on a successful play. Judge James Hardy	 and his wife Emmily	 are facing a domestic crisis that must be dealt with. Married daughter Joan comes home after she has committed a social blunder and her husband holds her responsible. At the same time	 another daughter	 Marion	 brings home a beau	 who is clear will clash with her father. The happy teen ager Andy	 seems to be the only one without a problem until his mother makes him escort Polly to the dance	 something he is reluctant to do.<br /><br />Needless to say	 Judge Hardy will prove why he knows best as he puts a plan into action to get everyone together again. After all	 he is a man that understands	 not only the law	 but how to deal with those outside forces that threatens his standing in the community and what will make his family happy.<br /><br />Lionel Barrymore plays Judge Hardy with conviction. He is the glue that holds everything together. Spring Byington is seen as Emily	 the mother. Mickey Rooney has a small part in this film	 but he is as always	 fun to watch. Cecilia Parker and Julie Haydon appeared as the daughters	 Marion and Joan. Sara Hayden and Margaret Marquis are also featured in the film as Aunt Milly and Polly	 the girl that surprises Andy with her beauty.<br /><br />""A Family Affair"" is a good way to observe our past through the positive image painted of an American family."	1.0
"OK well i found this movie in my dads old pile of movies and it looked pretty good from the cover but the movie actually sucked!! OK the first story with the swimmer was pretty good but it took a while to get into	 then the one with the boy was completely retarded! It wasn't even scary! His dream sounds like a little kid's bedtime story. Then the news girls one was completely retarded too. I'm sure someones going to call up the news guy and ask him to go out with you. But that one ended cool where she stabbed him and she was in the hospital and she saw him on t.v and he said all that junk to her. Next was that pretty gay story about the guy who brought back the dead people..OMG its so stupid I'm not even going to say any more about it.The last one was the best. It wasn't that scary but the idea of the story was pretty cool..uh yeah the girl gets possessed and she kills all her classmates or something. Then when they're all done telling their dreams to each other the losers get on the bus (TO HELL AHAHAHAH) and they see all the people from their dreams on the bus(Ha). The End."	0.0
"Those 2 points are dedicated the reasonable performance from Akshay Kumar. I know Bollywood films do not really strive to be realistic but PLEASE a Walt Disney production is more realistic than this plot. The father is dying and does what any good parent does...kick his son out the son with his PREGNANT wife. A few things that were too hard to swallow- 1. Priyanka 'cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom' and to go from that to living hungry in her in-laws garden shed???????? 2. Akshay suddenly got the job as a stunt man	 gets bitten by rabified dogs	 to then just walk off. This film is an INSulT to our intelligence I really cant believe i contributed financially to the 'people' who made this film by taking my family to see it	 we left the cinema with a frown	 please do not subject yourself to this mess to watching this take my advice and do not waste your 'waqt'."	0.0
"If you enjoy the subtle (yes	 I said subtle) actions and reactions of John Candy	 you can't help but like this film (pronounced ""fillum"" by Salvatore DiPasquale). The unobservant (and uninformed) watcher always saw Candy as a broad actor - a big buffoon. And sometimes he was (see ""Stripes"" and ""Splash""). But	 when given the opportunity	 he could really be razor-sharp and quite subtle. It's too bad he was cast in so many roles that only showed his broad side	 because we'll never get to see more of the other. Oh	 yeah	 the movie. One can watch ""Going Berserk"" over and over (I know I have) with the frequency of ""Caddyshack."" It's just that good. The plot	 although a little convoluted	 is actually fairly deep for a farce of this kind. It allows Candy and the always under-rated Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy to bounce off of Candy...and they bounce HARD. Definitely worth a glance for anyone who enjoyed SCTV or Candy's other work."	1.0
"Stephane Rideau was already a star for his tour de force in ""Wild Reeds	"" and he is one of France's biggest indie stars. In this film	 he plays Cedric	 a local boy who meets vacationing Mathieu (newcomer Jamie Elkaim	 in a stunning	 nuanced	 ethereal performance) at the beach. Mathieu has a complex relationship with his ill mother	 demanding aunt and sister (with whom he has a competitive relationship). Soon	 the two are falling in love.<br /><br />The film's fractured narrative -- which is comprised of lengthy flash-backs	 bits and pieces of the present	 and real-time forward-movement into the future -- is a little daunting. Director Sebastien Lifshitz doesn't signal which time-period we are in	 and the story line can be difficult to follow. But stick it out: The film's final 45 minutes are so engrossing that you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. By turns heart-breaking and uplifting	 this film ranks with ""Beautiful Thing"" as must-see cinema."	1.0
"I'll be short and to the point. This movie was an insult to any one with a room temperature IQ. Sorry liberals	 feminists	 etc. No women will ever be a Seal. They can forget about the draft or being in combat too. Ain't going to happen. You see	 hard as it is to understand or accept	 men and women are physically different.Regardless of the fact it is 2007	reality cannot change things in order for people to avoid having their feelings hurt. Men can't give birth or breast feed babies( Oh-I forgot about San Franfreako ).<br /><br />Women lack the physical strength to be on par with men in a combat or other physically challenging situations. How many women play in the NFL or NHL? Lastly	 I couldn't give a bloody hoot in hell if what I just wrote upsets you.Come to think of it - if this does upset you that only warms my heart more. I didn't write one thing that wasn't the truth. This imbecilic movie is nothing more than a comedy and a lousy one at that."	0.0
"99.999% pure crap. And the other .001% was a brief moment where I thought the blond chick was going to disrobe. Nope.<br /><br />The dialogue was legendarily bad. The action sucked	 and there was no sex (the afore mentioned blond chick is modestly dressed	 alas	 the whole movie). The CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst I've ever seen on film	 and the anachronisms were numerous and glaring. Acting was mediocre even from Ben Cross and Marina Sirtis	 the only 'names' in this movie. And Marina Sirtis looked really	 really bad.<br /><br />I've seen high school plays more capably produced. This is the kind of movie that MST3K thrived on. Heads should roll at Sci-Fi for allowing this steaming pile on the air."	0.0
"I've seen this movie	 when I was traveling in Brazil. I found it difficult to really understand Brazilian culture and society	 because it has so many regional and class differences. To see this movie in Sao Paulo itself was a revelation. It shows something of the everyday life of many Brazilians. On the other side	 it is sometimes a little bit over-dramatized. And that's the only negative comment I have on this film. It's sometimes too much	 too much sex	 too many murders and too much cynicism for one film. The director could film some things a bit more subtle	 it would make the film more effective.<br /><br />Despite this I liked the movie and the way the story unravels itself. The characters are complex	 and very much like real-life people. Not pretty American actors and actresses with a lot of cosmetics	 but people who could be ugly and beautiful at the same time. That makes the film realistic	 even when the story is not that convincing."	1.0

"This was a crappy movie	 with a whole lotta non-sense and too many loose-ends to count. I only watched this movie because one of my favorite actors (Ron Livingston) made a cameo in it	 and I continued watching it because as a girl	 I love any movie that includes male nudity for a change. Later	 I found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the storyline could get	 and each time it got...more... ridiculous.<br /><br />Sean Crawley (good-looking Chris L. McKenna	 whom I've never seen before - but LOVED his little nude scene)is making ends meet as a painter	 when he meets electrician Duke Wayne (George Wendt from ""Cheers""). Thinking he's getting more work from Duke	 Sean agrees to meet contractor Ray Matthews (Daniel Baldwin	 playing a stereotypically evil guy). Ray is being investigated by a City Hall accountant (Ron Livingston in a cameo	 who I've been in love with from ""Office Space"" up to ""Sex & the City""). Ray end up offering the apparently desperate-for- cash Sean $13k to kill the accountant	 and Sean accepts the job. Sean stalks out the accountant	 whose wife (Kari Wuhrer) he finds himself attracted to	 completes the hit	 and leaves - taking the file of information against Ray with him. Sean quickly learns he was being used	 that Ray never intended to pay him	 and Sean uses the file as leverage to get his money.<br /><br />Up to this point	 it's a descent flick...generally worth watching. But as soon as Ray	 Duke and their crew kidnap Sean to muscle the information about the file out of him	 it just got dumber and dumber (and still DUMBER...)	 until finally it seemed like the film's writer	 Charlie Higson	 had snapped out of a 10-day writing hangover and realized he needed to desperately figure out how to wrap up the series of implausible messes he created before a deadline or something. Without simply detailing the movie	 let's just say that in every-single-scene you watch after the kidnapping	 you find yourself gasping ""what the f**K!	"" baffled by the ongoing nonsense as Sean follows a fairly graphic and gross path towards redemption. In the end	 so many loose-ends are left in the movie	 that you begin to regret that you even watched it.<br /><br />This is a movie that you should only watch after it hits cable	 and you should have enough beer and friends around to mock the film to it's full value. It's supposed to be a psychological thriller	 and McKenna is a decent actor	 but it's hard to give yourself to the movie when you have ""Norm"" from ""Cheers"" and a Baldwin brother doing the dirty work	 and a kidnapping strategy that really makes no damned sense. Guys will love the violence	 blood and guts scenes	 and the absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and boob shots. Girls will enjoy handsome Sean's gratuitous crotch shot in a mainstream movie	 when its almost always the girls that get stripped down in a movie. Personally	 I hate that the only actor worth watching for more than his looks (Ron Livingston) is only in the first one-third of the movie."	0.0
"Okay	 here's what I think about Jack Frost. I looked at the morphing box for the VHS tape and I thought to myself	 this looks interesting. I rent it and I take it home. Boy was I right	 it is interesting. They put serial killer's spirits in dreams	 in walking corpses and inside every day machines. But this has got to be the most unique place to put the spirit of a serial killer. Inside the body of a snowman. I liked all the friendly snowman images littering the landscape	 the pot holder	 the snow globe	 etc. I like the actor who played Jack	 he put some fun into a killer really not seen since FREDDY KRUGGER. That's right	 I said it. FREDDY KRUGGER. It's that level of ""cool"". I wish some of the puppet effects were better	 the mouth movements could have matched better. But I chalk that up to a small budget. The cast does a great job	 there are some great one liners and scares to make any hardcore horror fan jump. All and all	 a great story	 good effects	 great dialog and a great cast. I give JACK FROST...9 STARS"	1.0
"by Dane Youssef <br /><br />""Coonskin"" is film	 by the one and only Ralph Bakshi	 is reportedly a satirical indictment of blaxploitation films and negative black stereotypes	 as well as a look at life black in modern America (modern for the day	 I mean--1975). Paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just burst into flame.<br /><br />But this is a Bakshi film	 controversial	 thrilling	 and a must-see almost by definition alone. Not just another random ""shock-jock"" of a movie which tries to shock for the sake of shock. It's by Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows the name knows that if HE made a movie	 he has something big to say...<br /><br />Although it's roots are based in cheap blaxploitation	 ""Coonskin"" isn't just another campy knock-off of mainstream white film or any kind of throwaway flick. ""Coonskin"" wants to be more. It aims it's sights higher and fries some much bigger fish.<br /><br />The movie doesn't just poke fun at the genre. Nor does it just indict black people	 but actually seems to show love	 beauty and heart in the strangest places.<br /><br />""Coonskin"" tells a story out of some convicts awaiting a jail-break. The fact that it's even possible to break out of a prison in the ""Coonskin"" world alone makes it old-fashioned.<br /><br />One of the inmates tells a story about a trio of black brothers in Harlem named Brother Bear	 Brother Rabbit	 Preacher Fox who want respect and a piece of the action and are willing to get it by any means necessary. The Itallian mob is running all the real action.<br /><br />Big name black musicians star: Barry White and Scatman Crothers	 as well as Charles Gordone	 the first black playwright to take home the Pulitzer. Something big is happening here obviously.<br /><br />The movie plays out like a descent into this world	 this side of the racial divide. From an angry	 hip	 deep	 soulful black man with a hate in his heart and a gun in his hand.<br /><br />Bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word ""sublety."" This one looks like it's never even heard of the word. But maybe a subject like this needs extremism. Real sledgehammer satire. Some subjects can't be tackled gently.<br /><br />Bakshi is god-dammed merciless. Here	 no member or minority of the Harlem scene appears unscathed.<br /><br />The characters here are ""animated"" to ""real"" all depending on what the mood and situation are. The animated characters and the human ones all share the same reality and are meant to be taken just as literally.<br /><br />Bakshi never just shows ugly caricatures just for shock value. He always has something to say. Nor is black-face is gratuitously. Here	 unlike in Spike Lee's ""Bamboozled	"" he seems to be using it to try and really say something.<br /><br />Like 99.9% of all of Bakshi's films	 this one incorporates animation and live-action. Usually at the same time. Bakshki isn't just being gimmicky here. All of this technique is all intertwined	 meshing together while saying something.<br /><br />Somehow	 this one feels inevitably dated. Many of these types of films (Bakshi's included) are very topical	 very spur of the moment. They reflect the certain trend for the day	 but looking back of them years later	 there's just an unmistakable feeling of nostalgia (as well as timeless truth).<br /><br />Even though the music	 clothes	 slang and the city clearly looks like photos that belong in a time capsule	 the attitude	 the spirit and the heart remain the same no matter what f--king ear it is. Anyone who's really seen the movies	 the state of things and has been in company of the people know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Even some of the of the black characters are a bunny (junglebunny)	 a big ol' bear and a fox. One of the most sour and unsavory racist characters is a dirty Harlem cop who's hot on the trail of these ""dirty n-----s"" after the death of a cop. But for him	 it's not just business. Nor is it for the rest of the brothers who wear the shield. It's just pure sadistic racist pleasure of hurting blacks.<br /><br />The sequence involving the Godfather and his lady is one of the most moving pieces in the whole film	 of which there are many. It plays out like an opera or a ballet.<br /><br />The promo line: WARNING: ""This film offends everybody!"" This is not just hype. Proceed with extreme caution.<br /><br />You have been warned...<br /><br />by Dane Youssef"	1.0
"Awful	 awful	 awful.<br /><br />A condescending remark at the start and a few nasty autopsy photos does not a good movie make. Once again I'm amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving a movie production and yet they don't have the pride to realise that what they have made is an utter pile of crap.<br /><br />I sat and tried to think of a redeeming feature so that I could at least balance my criticism but the only one I could think of was that the opening track by Pink was pretty good....I wonder if she has seen this?<br /><br />Watch this at your peril	 the boredom may kill you."	0.0
"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was going to get up and leave at Tape 4 but I stuck it out. I now consider myself a Masochist! Afghanistan? Come on guys! Who's the idiot who forgot to hide the Sanskrit billboards? I thought the lead actor(George Calil) was particularly inept. Apart from the bad acting and over zealous camera shake	 I thought using the events of 9/11 as a reason to make ""Larson the Lunatic Implodes	 all over a screen near you"" disgraceful and irreverent to the victims of 9/11. Using a phone call from Larson's wife	 Sarah	 supposedly from one of the terrorist held planes on that day	 was appalling. The camera shake didn't make me feel sick	 that cold hearted stunt did."	0.0
"I wouldn't call ""We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story"" simply a kiddie version of ""Jurassic Park"". I found it more interesting than that. Like the former	 it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours. But it really opens my eyes when I see who provided the voices: John Goodman	 Rhea Perlman	 Jay Leno	 Walter Cronkite	 Julia Child	 Kenneth Mars	 Yeardley Smith	 Martin Short and Larry King. To paraphrase that: a given actor	 the ""Cheers"" woman	 the ""Tonight Show"" host	 the Most Trusted Name In News	 a famous chef	 the ""Young Frankenstein"" police chief	 Lisa Simpson	 one of the Three Amigos and the CNN guy.<br /><br />But I guess that I shouldn't focus only on the cast. I thought that this movie had something for both children (purely fun) and adults (natural history). True	 it's escapism	 but the perceptive kind. I would actually say that John Goodman doing Rex's voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work in ""Monsters Inc"". Worth seeing."	1.0
"It really is a shame that films like this never snag Best Picture nominations	 because this one is simply a winner. This is by far the most consistently hilarious comedy I have ever seen.

"This was a great movie with a good story. My children (10	 7	 5	 and 4) all loved this movie	 including myself. The music was also fantastic. No	 the horses do not talk	 but instead	 the story is told by Spirit. And to hear a story told by a horse's point if view was fun.<br /><br />I think the title says it all	 ""spirit"". This movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friends. I would have to say my 4 year old boy and 5 year old girl were really touched by this movie	 and even got so into it	 they laughed so hard	 and they cheered for spirit in the end. <br /><br />Enjoy ""Spirit"" with your family and have your spirit lifted with this heartwarming story. Your kids will love it. I think you will too."	1.0
"Love is overwhelming... In all it's manifestations... Gorgeous	 absolutely gorgeous... Tudor Chirila	 Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu	 one truly dramatic story about love in all it's shapes	 a story about the undecipherable ways of young hearts	 about life and lost innocence all directed by the skillful eye of Tudor Giurgiu. With a magnificent soundtrack featuring Faultline & Chris Martin and Vama Veche it surprises in every way leaving behind the sour taste of misunderstanding love... Truly remarkable... Is it me or is Romanian cinematography slowly but surely advancing and gaining respect? This is a brilliant film... Two thumbs up to everybody involved."	1.0
"I don't know where to begin. This movie feels a lot like one of those cheap Saturday morning kids shows that they used to make back in the late eighties early nineties. Sort of like Captain Power or the Power Rangers. It's full of bad digital overlays and really cheesy sounding ""secret agencies"" and villains.<br /><br />The acting is so bad that it's not even funny. The direction is terrible and there is little to now continuity. It seems as if someone just threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot that there was supposed to be a plot.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early on	 when several villains plant an explosive device in an agents car. For some reason	 even though the device is clearly stated as being ""remote detonated"" the bad guys decide to chase her down on their motorcycles as she drives away. This chase carries on. all the while with the bad guys doing ludicrous and completely pointless bike stunts. Standing up on the bikes	 doing wheelies and so on. At one point	 a crash happens and one of the attackers is thrown from his bike	 we see the bike (clearly cgi) thrown over the agents car but the rider has vanished. Then	 a few seconds later the rider and bike return...apparently unscathed by the crash. At this point even though the car has an explosive device planted in it	 the attackers choose to shoot the agent while driving past	 then blow up her car. Which was also clearly done with cgi. Sound confusing? It is	 and so is the rest of the movie.<br /><br />I might point out that when I say cgi	 we aren't talking about Lord Of The Rings type cgi here. We're talking the cheap cheesy Power Rangers type cgi	 actually I think it would have been done better on Power Rangers.<br /><br />Why Savini and Todd did this movie I will never know	 I can only assume they did for money	 as a favor to someone or because they were blackmailed into it...probably the last one."	0.0
"Enjoyed this 1936 film with plenty of veteran classic actors and especially	 William Powell	 (Dr. Lawrence Bradford)	 ""Mister Roberts""	 who played the role as a doctor and detective. Dr. Bradford was once married to Jean Arthur	 (Paula Bradford)	 ""Shane""	 and got a divorce and still they managed to live with each other and also fight all the time. Paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything she could to convince him it was very important. Jean Arthur plays a rather nutty type and there is plenty of 1936 Comedy and the method of murder is something you will never believe	 especially with a jockey on a California Race Track. Robert Armstrong	 (Nick Martel) ""King Kong"" gave a great supporting role as a bookie along with James Gleason	 a detective who need the help of Dr. Bradford in order to solve this very strange murder mystery. If you see this film	 just remember it was produced and directed in 1936 and the people in the audience in those days thought this was great entertainment and it really was in Those DAYS!"	1.0
"This movie was o.k. but it could have been much better. There are some spooky moments but there aren't enough of them to make me ever want to see this movie again. There are some scenes you could fast forward through & not miss anything. The biggest flaw is that it is so predictable	 & that is the reason why I rated it so low. It's watchable but don't expect anything great."	0.0
"I am not sure who is writing these<br /><br />glowing reviews for this movie but trust me it STKINKS. I have seen hundreds of horror films and slasher flicks and this one is LAME it is only about 80min long and believe me that is all I could take. Plot is terrible	 acting is even worse. And there is no development at all.<br /><br />Even the David Cocteau films are better than this. RUN AWAY from JIGSAW . I expected to hate the acting	 which can be forgiven in direct to video movies	 if the plot is good.<br /><br />This had no scares	 very little Gore	<br /><br />and a truly unattractive cast.<br /><br />I watched this with three other friends<br /><br />who I hope are still talking to me!<br /><br />They wanted me to fling the disc out the window. I can not believe anyone could have<br /><br />given this tripe a good review."	0.0
"I've never understood the appeal of Garbo. She always comes across in her films as stuck up	 not all that alluring	 and that annoying voice that could have drowned out the tuba section. She was also a very limited actress	 like Gloria Swanson far better off left in the silent era. In this her last film	 her performance is very average and even unassured. She tries hard but it all comes to nothing because the script is even worse than her acting.<br /><br />A would be screwball romcom that is never once believable and never gets off the ground (even though Melvyn Douglas manages to get airborne in the skiing scenes	 which are really the only amusing thing here).<br /><br />There was potential but the script fails in almost every department	 wasting every actor in it. Douglas and Garbo had good enough chemistry together but this one isn't even a spot on Ninotchka	 which I also found to be extremely overrated."	0.0
"Horrible film with bits of the Ramones strewn about. Your worse than average 1970's/80's comedy format of the cool kids taking over the school with some whimsical plan. This movie is terrible. The plot consists of a girl who enjoys the Ramones and a school bent on fighting against their oppressive administration. Forget this movie and watch something like Wild Zero starring Guitar Wolf if you want an entertaining B movie. Terrible acting	 terrible writing	 terrible plot with the stamp of approval of the Ramones who probably needed some money quick so they said yes to this movie. That is the only logical thing I can think of because this movie blows."	0.0
"While I totally disagree with one reviewer who described Charley Chase as unfunny	 in this film he certainly is. It's a shame	 as I suspect the other reviewer must have only seen a few Charley Chase duds and assumed the guy wasn't funny. Films like MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE and WHAT PRICE GOOFY? are very good Chase films	 so he COULD be really funny given good material. Unfortunately	 in this film he's given absolutely nothing. Even the inclusion of the usually good Oliver Hardy as a foil isn't any help because the basic premise (boy wants to marry girl but girl's father thinks the boy is a wuss) and the gags are so poor. It's a shame	 as I really wanted to love this film but couldn't.<br /><br />By the way	 for those used to the look for Charley from the mid-1920s on	 you'll be pretty surprised as Chase sports no glasses or mustache--and looks very little like you'd expect."	0.0

"I'm writing this because I somehow felt being led to believe Dark Remains was a good movie. Whilst it's not the worst I've seen	 it certainly isn't good.<br /><br />A Weak script	 weak actors	 and weak directing. Even if they can't afford big name cast	 would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actress? It was painful to watch a plain actress through out the film with her dull performance. The story was a cliché and poorly scripted. The special effects were minimal. The ""suspense"" tricks employed repetitively here were hard to swallow.<br /><br />To be fair	 Dark Remains is no worse than quite some of the Masters of Horrors' episodes. But not quite on par with quality movies yet. Dark Remains is only recommended for the hardcore horror fans who don't want to miss any movie in the genre	 even if it's a poorly made one. As for anyone else	 time should be spent on something more valuable - which should be extremely easy."	0.0
"""Bruce Almighty"" looks and sounds incredibly stupid	 especially from the trailers. Nevertheless	 I found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry at God and is given divine powers by him to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man symbolized here as God	 and though it isn't his usual type of film or one of his best roles	 he does excellent with what he is given to work with. Although crude at times	 the film does have quite a few laughs	 from Bruce parting his soup in half like the Red Sea and the customers' reactions to him	 as well as Freeman's seemingly laid-back and wisecracking image of God. It is overly exaggerated at times	 and there is some crude humor	 but overall it manages to be somewhat funny. There is a decent supporting cast	 such as Jennifer Aniston	 Lisa Ann Walter	 and Steve Carrell	 which always helps. The end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear-jerking	 and the message is clear	 that we should do what God has called us to do and ""be the miracle."" The film is far from perfect	 but still enjoyable	 and far better than I and many people probably would have expected	 especially if we see the deeper message of the film.<br /><br />*** out of ****"	1.0
"OK I'm not an American	 but in my humble Scottish opinion Steve Martin is not	 never has been	 and never will be a funny man as long as our posteriors point in a southerly direction. Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko was a funny man	 no doubt due to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented team working characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and dateless situation comedies America has ever produced. How anyone could have the audacity to even attempt to replicate the Phil Silvers character is beyond me. To compound things the exercise was repeated in Martin's unfunny attempt to be Peter Seller's Inspector Clouseau	 another abortive attempt	 in my opinion	 to rekindle a demonstrably unfunny career. Some of your contributers say 'Steve Martin puts his own stamp on the character'	 to that I would say 'balderdash' 	 his portrayals will be long forgotten when those of Silvers and Sellars will be treasured for generations to come"	0.0
"Just picked up this film for a buck at National Wholesale Liquidators	 and after watching it	 I feel like I got ripped-off.<br /><br />I don't know that I've seen a worse film than this. Honestly. And I would never write a negative review of a film had I not such enormous respect for the subject matter	 that is	 Stephen Foster and his music.<br /><br />First	 what is it? It's a musical biography? Yeah	 lot's of tunes by Foster then interspersed here and there are these pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Kern-type numbers that reek more than the Mississippi delta. I mean	 somebody got PAID to write this drivel? Secondly	 the REAL story of Foster is a fascinating one. Why not even come CLOSE to it? Thirdly	 what did they have on the great Ray Middleton to get him to do this film? Pictures of him with small boys?? With communists? What a waste of a great talent.<br /><br />So	 friends of Foster	 and the truth	 and good entertainment	 be afraid... be very	 very	 afraid."	0.0

"I don't know why I picked this movie to watch	 it has a strange title and from the description it just looked like something different. Every once in a while its good to try a film that's slightly different from the mainstream Hollywood hero/thriller flick and this film certainly was different. Right from the beginning this film had me intrigued but I couldn't figure out why until the end if the film when I realized that the movie was great because the characters were so real. I thought the acting was superb and the character development really makes you care about them and hope things turn out well for them in the end. I think that everyone who watches the film could in some way relate to one of the characters and this makes for great viewing and some good laughs at the sheer ordinariness of the actors. <br /><br />At the culmination of the movie you definitely get a sense of well being	 and are left with the 'things are going to be OK' type of a feeling. I'm sure this will have wide appeal and should be given a chance."	1.0
"More of a mystery movie with some gratuitous horror elements thrown in; mediocre overall.<br /><br />It starts with a woman having a nightmare in which her sex partner gets out of bed	 goes into the room of her crying child	 and kills it. She wakes up. Then	 that man is dying in a hospital	 spitting up blood. His estranged daughter arrives	 and he manages to contact her through her dreams (I think)	 and he wants her to find out who killed him before his body entirely decomposes in its grave.<br /><br />There's not too much mystery about who did it	 or even how; most viewers will have figured that out long before it is revealed. I'm not sure the way he was killed would really have worked.<br /><br />Anyway	 the horror elements get in through: a gory autopsy	 the recurring dream of the man killing the boy	 a nightmare in which a plate of eggs turn into eyes which are then cut	 and several shots of the decomposing man both in nightmares and actually in his grave.<br /><br />I was a little surprised to see a dedication in the end by Fulci to Clive Barker! Interesting."	0.0

"Wow. I thought this might be insipid but it was even worse than I imagined! Sometimes I like to watch a good ""car-crash"" movie: those that are so bad that you can't look away because you want to see how bad they can possibly get. This is really the only reason I could leave the television on - morbid fascination. It wasn't so much the acting	 which was only mediocre or slightly worse than one would expect from this cast	 but the premise and the plot which never should have seen the light of day. The script	 too	 is groan-inducing. As for cinematography	 did anyone else notice that they used a ""curtains drawing"" segue device	 like in an old 50's TV show...but without irony? At first I thought they must be kidding but the movie takes itself too seriously to have used this in a tongue-in-cheek manner. Don't even ask me about the score...the only high point is the final song	 by Morcheeba. I guess they wanted to leave people with something for their $8...glad I saw it on TV!!!!! Just silly! I wonder if this is why Timothy Hutton has had trouble finding much work recently? I guess if you don't expect much	 and want to watch a mindless thriller	 it would be better than spending an evening clipping your toenails	 which is why it merits a 2."	0.0
"If you have any clue about Jane Austen´s production	 you´ll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels: marriage	 marriage and marriage! In my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring	 but I like Austen´s characters	 because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in Emma. The thing that makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow	 she´s very good in her leading role. Also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie don´t seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious."	1.0
"The Marriage of Maria Braun (MMB) is about a German girl (Maria) getting married to a German soldier (Herman Braun) just at the ending of the war. After being married for half a day and a night	 Herman is send to the front again. To make ends meet	 Maria starts working at a bar for mainly American soldiers and get to know a black soldier. She got word that Herman died at the front	 and things develop between her and the American soldier. Herman walks in on them	 in bed	 and after a confrontation between him and the American	 Maria killed the American. Herman admits to the murder	 ends up in jail and Maria vows to wait for him. The country is in shambles; one sees people leaving everything that they are busy with for a cigarette. There are food shortages. It is in short	 a time of survival of the fittest. <br /><br />Basically this film projects Maria's attitudes - those attitudes she permits herself under the mentioned circumstances	 as a metaphor for Germany's loss of soul after they lost the war	 and how it proceeds to rebuild itself. For example	 Maria has the following conversation with a peddler (played by Fassbinder himself); the peddler tries to sell her an excellent copy of Kleist and she remarks that ""Kleist burns out to quickly	 it does not provide enough heat for the cold"". The peddler answers ""That's another way to look at it. Right now	 it's probably the correct way"". <br /><br />Maria meets a French/German business man	 Karl Oswald after she bargains her way into the first class train compartment. She decides to get involve with Karl	 ""You're not having an affair with me; I'm having an affair with you"". She also takes responsibility in the company	 and after a while has the complete trust of the firm. When Karl says ""I suppose we'll just have to wait for a miracle"" she replies ""I prefer making miracles  then wait for them"". In her own words	 she has become the ""Mata Hari of the economic miracle"".<br /><br />In a lot of Fassbinder's films he tried to expose the psychological processes which lie behind social mechanisms (see Freud); in other words	 he liked pointing his camera at the bullsh*t	 the false social mechanisms	 the pretending. The direct approach Maria takes in this film is successful to convey this ideology. For example	 she phones Karl and when he picks up the phone her request is straight to the point ""I need someone to sleep with"". As Fassbinder said ""the emotions people felt did not exist at all and were only a kind of sentimentality which we thought we needed to be properly functioning members of society"". He also remarked that his films are anti emotional. <br /><br />I particularly liked the scene when Karl and Maria meet in the Munich restaurant (apparently	 frequently visited by Hitler himself). Maria appears in control and Karl a bit on the down side	 as if Maria's 'brutal honesty' wears him out	 as if he is not completely up to the situation anymore. Karl says ""I have to tell myself over and over that I love life"". Maria replies ""That's life isn't it. As if we signed a contract to enjoy life. And then we go out to eat and talk about food"". I guess this is also about Fassbinder attitudes on relationships	 to never submit completely to anyone. And why would you	 if the central matter of most of his films is about ""What love becomes in this society  a commodity	 an instrument of power	 a weapon.""<br /><br />It was remarked that it is typical Fassbinder to have the scenes with Maria and Betti walking in expensive dresses in the ruins after the war - with these clothing essentially the wrong period. What I think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes	 when you feel bad	 that ""you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great"". But	 Fassbinder was not interested in perfection. Any mistakes made in a film could just be corrected in the next project. Since he completed films (approximately 4 a year) the way other people rolled cigarettes	 it is not peculiar that this film has some very bad scenes. Peter Marthesheimer	 who wrote most of the script	 mentioned that Fassbinder likely dreamed up the whole scene with Maria and the American in the park	 overnight. <br /><br />Hanna Schygulla is brilliant as Maria. Mostly	 she just stares bluntly into the camera. In Maria's own words ""It is a bad time for emotions. But	 I like it like that"". <br /><br />There are different opinions about the end. After Karl died of a hart attack	 Herman finally shows up. (Herman left for Australia after he got out of prison	 to ""become human again"".) After the testament is delivered (made out to her and Herman in half)	 Maria forgets to close the gas on the stove when she lights her cigarette	 and blow her and Herman up. For me it is obvious that she just did that by accident. At the same time	 she must have been rattled when her dreams finally seem about to come true. She must have felt as if she was not herself anymore. She felt as if she had outlived herself."	1.0
"HAH! So this is the movie that the ""Next Action Stars"" were getting into. Well I'm glad that I didn't participate and didn't win...<br /><br />Isn't it funny how one can just look at the first 10 seconds(!) and make up ones mind about a movie? I mean	 come on! Just look at those titles!? I watched this movie(or part of this ""teleplay"" since it was produced for TV and we couldn't bear to watch the whole thing) one evening while doing my military service and the audience with me was the typical hodge-podge of average guys that once in a while watch series like Las Vegas just for the girls in the show. so the bar wasn't really high	 the most watched movie in my group was Girl Next Door (and it wasn't because of the great script ;D . But this movie's total lack of originality	 acting	 scripting	 and just about everything else that makes a movie good made it pretty easy to switch channel to Las Vegas (or was it CSI? don't remember...) without any complaints by the rest of the group. And that is rare(!) For heavens sake! Don't by this movie! If it's on TV	 then yes	 watch it. And contemplate on it. My conclusion? well	 since Joel Silver has indeed produced some of the best action-films out there (Die Hard	 Matrix 1	 to name some) I can only say that producers don't give the film it's quality	 they provide money for the directors. And to sell this movie just because it's a Joel Silver movie is just a desperate attempt to conceal the obvious flaws of the crew who really made it."	0.0
"One of the great things about many of the superb Chinese movies you can find	 if you are lucky	 in the video stores	 is they are very accurate retellings of actual	 true stories. Farewell	 my Concubine	 The Emperor and the Assassin and this movie are perfect examples. The film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience -- the hallmark of much Hollywood	 and especially Disney films.<br /><br />In this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the King of Masks for his mastery of Sichuan Change Art. Along an having lost his only son many years earlier	 he searches to find a male heir to carry on his rare and dying art in a society that forbids females to have such work. Master Wang is sold a son by a slave trader. All is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art. But the son eventually is found out to be a girl. From there	 the story get very interesting	 with a good performance by Master Liang of the Sichuan Opera -- a regional operatic style related to Peking Opera. Fans of Farewell My Concubine should look carefully at Master Liang's portrayal of a male playing the female role in Chinese Opera. It may help them come to understand that the players of these female roles were probably not homosexuals or castrati	 but people who have be so psychologically conditioned as to be totally unaware of their own sexuality."	1.0
"This film is very creepy indeed. Unfortunately	 not for the reasons the film makers would hope.<br /><br />There's a mastermind serial killer too	 but he's not what's creepy either. He's just your standard comic book villain	 a cross between Hannibal Lecter and Freddie Kruger	 though with nothing particularly fresh to add to either. Incidentally	 for even the vilest and most reprehensible of criminals	 can they be detained chained in a stress position	 on their feet	 arms outstretched 24 hours a day week in week out? I suppose in the world that gave us Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay	 anything's possible.<br /><br />No	 what's really creepy about this film is the central character	 Danny. This unappealing young man	 aided and abetted it's true by some ludicrously lax security arrangements and a doctor entirely careless of any notion of professional ethics or patient confidentiality	 wanders into the hospital room occupied by what can only be described as a highly vulnerable and defenceless young woman	 and on the basis of nothing whatsoever (her chronic sleeping precludes from being able to give anything like informed consent) imagines himself to have some sort of special relationship with her.<br /><br />Seemingly within days	 he has arrogated to himself the right to abduct her	 believing (completely falsely	 as we discover) that he is better able to care for her than anyone else	 and within minutes of getting her back to his apartment	 is sexually molesting her though she is (again due to her sleepiness) entirely unable to consent or resist.<br /><br />Our suspicions as to why he would feel this connection are pretty soon confirmed. He is of course more or less unable to form any mature adult friendships	 let alone sexual relationships	 so instead falls back on this essentially infantilised woman	 who because of her permanent sleeping has a mental age corresponding to a lived experience of only a few years. The scene where she discovers ice cream is particularly cringe-making	 and the coyly knowing look she gives him when he gloatingly says he'll have to clean her up again causes a particular shudder of horror. But again	 I'm afraid	 not that shudder of horror the film makers were hoping for	 but a much more straightforward spasm of revulsion. We can all see clearly what's on the end of our forks here - it's the paedophile's perfect dream of innocence	 sexual compliance and utter dependence. Horrible	 horrible	 horrible.<br /><br />What else have we got in this mish mash? Twisted dreamscapes not quite as good as del Toro. The compulsory ""You need to go to the police"" argument	 where the lead character always has a reason for not doing so even though it's the only sensible course of action. The automaton sequence	 much praised in the comments here	 though completely and utterly pointless (""It serves no function!""	 as Sigourney Weaver memorably protested in Galaxy Quest) and looking to me just like the Abominable Doctor Phibes rehashed in one of the Saw derivatives.<br /><br />Jeffrey Combs does his best though	 so a star for that	 and a couple more because you have to keep lower rankings for films that are even worse than this	 and in general this is well-shot and competently performed."	0.0

By reading the box at the video store this movie looks rather amusingly disturbing. You know the type....funny but supposed to frighten you.... this was not funny or horrific. the writing was lame...the jokes failed to make me laugh even at their extreme mundaneness....they were so expected. the actors didn't even do much with such a not so good script...at least I hope that wasn't their best..watch this movie at your own risk......I give it negative 3 stars outta 10	0.0
"I Am Curious is really two films in one - half of it is the sexual experimental side of Lena and the other half is her curiosity with political/socialism. Whatever the director's intention	 the two don't really mesh together. The director should have just stuck with the romantic side of Lena and made a separate movie for the politics. There is a bizarre mixture of political/war rallies	 Dr. King	 serious political interviews	 flopping breasts	 and pubic hair. The film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie. Other than the interesting sex scenes	 you'll be bored dry watching this film. Unlike many other reviewers	 I think the nude/sexual scenes are overdone for what it is. If you want to see real porn	 I'm sure there are better choices. The pervasive nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is. I think the cast did a fine job however. They played their parts believably. There is little of the over-the-topness I'm so used to seeing in the American films during this time."	0.0
"It's about time we see a movie that stays unbiased towards these old Indian traditions. At times it is clear how most of the 'doctors' are charlatans	 even lying about how they don't charge their clients. While they are wearing their gold watches	 the 'donation' box is mandatory. Notice that there are only a couple of people who get 'cured' while we see quite a few cases.<br /><br />Keep in mind while watching that ingesting mercury is not toxic and that the smallest Indian bank note is 5 rupee	 while the average salary in India is 1	700 ru/month."	0.0
"Vampires Vs. Zombies wasn't the original title. It was actually... <br /><br />Nasty Lesbian Semi-Vampires and Two Zombies Getting Hit by Cars: Special Guest appearances by Bob the Lesbian Gypsie-Witch and her dog	 Random Woman with special powers and the Catholic School Girl Short Skirt Zombie Choir. <br /><br />Also on the Box: Warning: No Plot- only the writer and director will understand the end	 or anything else in this movie.<br /><br />Seriously though	 I love bad movies. I love Vampires. I love Zombies. Hell	 I even enjoy the lesbians. This movie combined all three with a vague and confusing (or non-existent) plot	 horrendous (I mean REALLY BAD) dialogue	 and random STUFF and PEOPLE that have nothing to do with anything (or do they... I didn't know what in the world was going on). Oh	 and I can't forget the green oatmeal 'Zombies' in latex gloves (yes	 the film makers were so cheap they couldn't even cover their Zombies hands in oatmeal and paint). Any way	 the result was this excruciatingly BAD film	 if you could even call it that. <br /><br />Was the end supposed to not make sense? The Vampire was really Nurse and the other girl was really a mental patient? Where were the Vampires Vs. Zombies? Hell	 where were the Vampires at all... you really couldn't call any of the girls vampires. Whatever. <br /><br />Don't ever rent or buy this movie. If you are REALLY curious... okay	 I'll understand. Seriously	 even lovers of BAD movies won't be able to stand this one. It should be number 1 on the bottom 100."	0.0
"I can't understand all the hype about this movie. OK	 if you like cheap splatter	 you will love this movie	 but if you like good stories and good actors - don't watch this. Personally i really disliked the actors in this movie	 they seem to be hired straight from the street. The Dialogs are completely flat and you always know what's coming up next. The overall quality of this movie lacks of the supposable very low budget. When we saw this movie (me and 3 other people) we all had in mind	 that this movie was made by some people who needed to do this	 just to get their graduation at a film school - with the lowest effort. Another issue that really lessens the whole experience is the bad cam (very shaking) and the bad sound	 the whole movie seems to be recored with a single microphone."	0.0
"After repeated listenings to the CD soundtrack	 I knew I wanted this film	 got it for Christmas and I was amazed. Marc Bolan had such charisma	 i can't describe it. I'd heard about him in that way	 but didn't understand what people were talking about until I was in the company of this footage. He was incredible. Clips from the Wembley concert are interspersed with surrealistic sketches such as nuns gorging themselves at a garden party as Marc Bolan performs some acoustic versions of Get It On	 etc. (I'm still learning the song titles). George Claydon	 the diminutive photographer from Magical Mystery Tour	 plays a chauffeur who jumps out of a car and eats one of the side mirrors. Nothing I can say to describe it would spoil it	 even though I put the spoilers disclaimer on this review	 so you would just need to see this for yourselves. It evades description. <br /><br />Yes	 I love the Beatles and was curious about Ringo directing a rock documentary - that was 35 years ago - now	 I finally find out it's been on DVD for 2 years	 but it's finally in my home. It's an amazing viewing experience - even enthralling. <br /><br />Now the DVD comes with hidden extras and the following is a copy and paste from another user: <br /><br />There's two hidden extras on the Born To boogie double DVD release. <br /><br />1.From the menu on disc one	select the bonus material and goto the extra scenes 2.On the extra scenes page goto Scene 42 take 1 and keep pressing left 3.when the cursor disappears keep pressing right until a ""Star+1972"" logo appears 4.Press Enter <br /><br />5.From the main menu on disc two	select the sound options 6.On the sound options page goto the 90/25 (I think thats right) option and keep pressing left 7.When the cursor disappears keep pressing right until a ""Star+Home video"" logo appears 8.Press Enter"	1.0
"Roman Polanski plays Trelkovsky who rents an apartment in France.The previous tenant is in a hospital after a suicide attempt.He goes to see her there where he also meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani)	 the friend of Simone.He and Stella become pretty close.Later Simone dies.Trelkovsky begins to think the landlord and the neighbors are trying to change him into Simone so that eventually he would also jump out of the window.Le Locataire (The Tenant) from 1976 is the last film of Polanski's apartment trilogy.The previous ones were Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby.Roman Polanski does not do good job only as the director but his acting is also superb.Isabelle Adjani with her big glasses is wonderful.The landlord	 Monsieur Zy is played by the great Melvyn Douglas.Jo Van Fleet plays Madame Dioz.The fantastic Shelley Winters is The Concierge.The Tenant is something very scary from time to time.It gives a lot of that psychological scare.This film is not the easiest one to understand or explain but that makes it all so fascinating."	1.0
"When teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichés that you can guarantee will follow.<br /><br />1)The teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local. Dan Van Husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly Sirens. What	 who	 how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst. 2)The van will break down. 3)Whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about.4)They will find a house inhabited by a madman	 he will capture them. 5) The house will have a phone but it will not work	 it will be disturbingly decorated	 there will be flickering neon light	 spiders and maggots. 6)The madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won't start (here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor). 7)The madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap	 weak scare and will then be killed properly. 8)Only a girl will be left alive from the group. 9)There will be an unnecessary twist at the end. <br /><br />Add to these elements naked Sirens (who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately) that seduce and kill the teens	 throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie.<br /><br />I think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but I am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film	 Darkhunters	 which is one of the worst films I have ever seen. At times the cinematography is very good	 the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies. I was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity. However	 the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film	 it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again	 but amongst the DVD extras.<br /><br />If you do rent this film I implore you to listen to the director's commentary it is beyond belief. There is more to say about this than the film itself. One staggering part of the commentary is the director's claim that the film is cliché leaden because it was a preconceived idea. He says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichés and openly he wonders if ""people will get it"". <br /><br />I'm afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clichés within them then it is not wittily scripted enough	 acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work. If this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question; ""What was the point?"" This is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies	 any attempt to do something clever or different haven't worked.<br /><br />The next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats. They rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use. However	 the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when Michael Mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary. There is a simple distinction to be made here; Mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style	 Roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures . I think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant.<br /><br />The best moment is reserved for Robert's comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film. Those who didn't like it are generalised as 'geeks' and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that. I must admit I was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn't singled out for ridicule. The tirade goes further as the group joke about Norwegian reviewers	 complete with 'hilarious' accents to imply that people from Norway wouldn't know a good film simply because of where they are born. As always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting	 they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant.<br /><br />The package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the Sirens were cast. Robert's swears blind in voice over	 'I didn't want to make a film that was like Baywatch' as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground. There is also a simpering	 self-indulgent documentary about the making of Darkhunters during which Robert's says that a reviewer has claimed that Forest is ""The best British film in years"". I don't know who he is trying to convince. At one point in the commentary track Robert's says jokingly ""I can see people sitting at home saying ""this isn't amazing	 its sh$t"" he isn't wrong."	0.0
"Or listening to	 for that matter. Even the soundtrack is a bore. <br /><br />Honestly	 this isn't the worst gay movie I've seen (that would be Regarding Billy)	 but it's down there very close to the bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />This thing drags and drags and drags. It's not that the plot is inane--in the hands of a good writer it might have worked . . . it certainly could have been much more entertaining. There's not one plot point you can't see coming for ten miles down the road. The dialog is flat. The jokes are old. To add insult to injury	 it's full of one-dimensional	 stereotypical gays. <br /><br />Nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible	 much less real. There was no chemistry	 no dynamic	 in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other . . . we're just told they're in love. Hard to figure when they have nothing in common and aren't compatible sexually. They like the same book? Huh?<br /><br />The acting is not totally bad	 but the pacing is excruciatingly slow. I mean	 almost Jarmusch- slow	 but without Jarmusch quality. In fact	 that would be a good barometer for you. If you like Jarmusch films	 avoid this one."	0.0
"Why is this movie not in the 250 best? This movie looks still astoundingly fresh 56 years after its production but it could only have been made at the aftermath of W.W.II because of the perception of the nearness of death. People were more aware that life could be stopped at one unexpected moment. And what after life? I liked the scene at the end with the judgment and all people of all nations gathered. The phlegmatic judge (Abraham Sofaer-a typical British judge-)	 Doctor Reeves (Roger Livesey) defending Peter Carter (David Niven) and also June (Kim Hunter) against the American prosecutor Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey I -there is a reason why it is an American-). It is all so imaginative! Michael Powell wrote	 directed and produced this astonishing movie which is a real ""tour-de-force"". The message of the movie is clear: in the universe the law is the most important but on earth nothing goes beyond the love between humans. The way in which this beautiful story is told is far more interesting than any Hollywood-movie could ever make."	1.0
"Remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest star in Hollywood because he made great movies? Those days are feeling like a more and more distant memory.<br /><br />While ""Hollywood Homicide"" is by no means terrible	 it is a routine and surprisingly boring buddy cop movie. It's a comedy that's not particularly funny	 and an action movie that's not especially exciting. An overabundance of subplots cannot mask the weakest of the central storyline.<br /><br />Ford at least appears to be enjoying himself more than is his last few projects	 and he is able to carry the film most of the time. Hartnett is adequate	 but he and Ford aren't exactly Newman and Redford as far as chemistry is concerned.<br /><br />All in all	 ""Hollywood Homicide"" is a reasonably amusing diversion	 but just barely. Take out Ford	 and it's not even that."	0.0
"""Ardh Satya"" is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema. Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani	 this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out to be a Commercial Success. Even today	 Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of India.<br /><br />The film tells the Real-life Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70s. Unlike any Police of other cities in India	 Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environment.<br /><br />Amongst various Police officers & colleagues	 the film describes the story of Anand Velankar	 a young hot-blooded Cop coming from a poor family. His father is a harsh Police Constable. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies & incidences of his father's Atrocities on his mother. Anand's approach towards immediate action against crime	 is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction. The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.This leads to frustrations	 as he cannot achieve the desired Job-satisfaction. Resulting from the frustrations	 his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars	 also turning him to an alcoholic.<br /><br />The Spirit within him is still alive	 as he constantly fights the system. He is aware of the system of the Metro	 where the Police & Politicians are a inertly associated by far end. His compromise towards unethical practice is negative. Finally he gets suspended.<br /><br />The Direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks in the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty's house to arrest him	 followed by short conversation which is fantastic. At many scenes	 the film has Hair-raising moments.<br /><br />The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch. Alcoholism	 Corruption	 Political Influence	 Courage	 Deceptions all are integral part of Mumbai police even today. Those aspects are dealt brilliantly.<br /><br />Finally	 the films belongs to the One man show	 Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly."	1.0
"Election marks the 2nd trial society theme movie directed by Johnnie To.<br /><br />To marvellously casted Simon Yan and Tony Leung Kar Fai as Lok and Big D	 as the two trial members who were chosen as candidates for the position of chairman for Ho Sing society	 a 100 year old trial society.<br /><br />While Lok is a man who keeps his cool at all times	 Big D is not only impatient	 but also thinks that he is on top of everything. Lok was chosen as the next chairman for 2 years. To have the total control of the gang	 the newly elected chairman must be passed down with a Dragon Baton	 which represents power and authority. Big D was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next chairman after paying a handsome figure of bribes to the council members. He ordered his man to get the Baton before it falls onto the hands of Lok.<br /><br />While Big D is getting the Baton	 Lok has other plans for him.<br /><br />This is one of the trial society theme movies where not much bloodshed is needed. Johnnie To puts the greed of the human beings in the movie	 where bloodshed is commonly used in other trial society theme movies to show how the greed of human beings can caused the death or the downfall of one. However	 no single bullet is used	 hardly any gangfights are involved in Election. It's the battle of the wits that makes Election stands out of the rest.<br /><br />Apart from Maggie Shiu	 the only actress in Election with less than 5 lines to talk in the whole movie	 masculinity rules the whole movie. Louis Koo and Nick Cheung	 who was seen in To's previous film	 are casted as an undercover cop and a gangster who sold his life to the gang respectively. Together with some of the veteran actors making their appearance in the film and the excellent script	 it makes the only HK movie to represent Cannes Fil Festival 2005.<br /><br />Election has hardly failed any critics who wants an different trial society theme movie."	1.0
"Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers has been messed around with in recent years	 in everything to Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film to a TV series	 to a number of games. But none of these	 so to speak	 has really captured the spirit of his novel. The games are usually unrelated	 the TV series was more of a spin off	 and the less said about Verhoeven's film	 the better. Little do most know	 however	 that in Japan	 an animated adaptation had already been done	 released the year of Heinlein's death. And	 believe it or not	 despite its differences	 this 6-part animated series is	 plot-wise	 the most faithful adaptation of Heinlein's classic.<br /><br />The most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons	 something we were deprived of in Verhoeven's film. Like the book	 the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel	 though we see a fair amount of each. While events happen differently than in the book	 the feel of the book's plot is present. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement	 but it's only slightly more touched upon than in the book. While some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book (it gets a bit of the anime treatment	 but what did you expect?)	 but it's far superior to the film. Heinlein's political views are merely excised	 as opposed to the film	 where they are reversed. The big payoff of the series	 however	 is the climatic battle on Klendathu between the troopers and the bugs/aliens	 which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version.<br /><br />Overall	 I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of Heinlein. And I think they did pretty well with this. If you can find this series	 give it a look."	1.0
"This movie appears to have been an on the job training exercise for the Coppola family. It doesn't seem to know whether to be an ""A"" or a ""B"" western. I mean	 the hero is called Hopalong Cassidy for God's sake. William Boyd must be spinning in his grave.<br /><br />All the ""B"" western cliches are here. The two-gun pearly toothed hero in the white hat with the trusty steed (""C'mon Thunder"")	 the all-in-black bearded villain	 the heroine in distress	 the rancher in trouble	 the cowardly sheriff	 over the top bad guys etc.<br /><br />The acting	 with few exceptions	 is strictly from the Yakima Canutt School of Acting. Chris Lybbert (who?) as the hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) as the villain look like they would have been more at home in a 30's Poverty Row quickie. The addition to the cast of veteran performers Martin Sheen	 Robert Carradine	 Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins helps a little	 but they are not given enough to do to salvage this one.<br /><br />What was the point of the Martin Sheen/Robert Carradine framing sequences? Are we to believe that the Sheen character was a ghost? What was the purpose of the black gloves? It just didn't make sense.<br /><br />Being a great lover of westerns from all genres	 I tried hard to find some redeeming qualities in this film. The cinematography was quite good and the settings looked very authentic. Aside from the hero and main villain	 the other characters looked authentic.<br /><br />If the producers were going to resurrect the Hopalong Cassidy character	 they might have given some thought to portraying him as he was originally written - a grizzled foul-mouthed ranch hand with a chip on his shoulder	 the kind of part Lee Marvin would have excelled in.<br /><br />What else can I say but..on Thunder	 on big fellow."	0.0
"I love killer Insects movies they are great fun to watch	 I had to watch this movie as it was one of my Favourite horror books by Shaun Hutson.<br /><br />I have met him and I wish I did listen to him as this movie was terrible like he Said it was	after he said that I was still dying to see how bad it was.<br /><br />The plot: People are dying mysteriously and gruesomely	 and nobody has a clue what the cause is.<br /><br />Only health worker Mike Brady has a possible solution	 but his theory of killer slugs is laughed at by the authorities.<br /><br />Only when the body count begins to rise and a slug expert from England begins snooping around does it begin to look like Mike had the right idea after all.<br /><br />This movie as the most overacting you ever see a movie! Slugs in this movie are fast (Then normal) and it looks like they fast forwarding the scenes! <br /><br />This movie is nothing like the book at all	 the book was ten times scarier	 ten times gory and had a lot more story to it!<br /><br />I didn't like this movie at all!

"Like some of the other reviewers have alluded to previously	 I'd like to know what moron actually read the script and went'	 ""Yea!!! This is it. This is the next film we are going to green light!!"" And whoever that person is	 should have his or her head examined for actual brain activity. Because whoever is responsible for actually dishing out money to have this made after reading the script	 well	 I'd love to give you my email address and maybe you'd like to just give away some more money. This film is atrocious in every way.<br /><br />The Wayans are funny	 at least they can be. They have made some good films and had some incredibly funny performances along the way. But in here	 not only does the premise defy all logic	 not only is the acting terrible	 not only is the entire movie offensive from start to finish	 not only is the direction as amateurish as you can find	 but they actually want you to pay to see this film.

"One-note comedy that probably sets modern day feminists' teeth on edge. Department store clerk Betsy Drake is in love with the idea of babies and marriage	 pinning her hopes on women's magazines until she spies super-bait in the form of sleek bachelor Cary Grant. The rest of the film plods from one ploy to the next as the relentless Drake pursues her quarry. I guess the word ""perky"" just about sum's up Drake's approach to the role. She does have a charming smile	 but after 20 minutes of memorizing her dentures	 I began to overdose. Grant's role is basically secondary and minus his usual flair. There is one scene	 however	 that almost salvages this slender exercise. Drake queries the hapless Grant following his lecture to a roomful of respectable ladies. Here her perky manner has an unforced freshness that is really quite remarkable	 and had the production not rubbed our noses in that upbeat grin for 90 minutes	 the film might have amounted to more than a girls' camp day-dream	 circa 1948."	0.0

"This is an odd film for me	 as after I reviewed a nice film from a new film maker (FAR OUT by Phil Mucci)	 another writer/director	 Ryan Jafri	 contacted me and asked me to watch and review his film	 THE CURE. I don't normally review films this way	 but what the heck--I love shorts and couldn't wait to see another.<br /><br />Interestingly	 while it turned out I did like THE CURE	 I was not thrilled by it and let Jafri know. To his credit	 he encouraged me to review it anyway--giving it my honest appraisal.<br /><br />The film has tremendous style and as far as Jafri's direction goes	 it's exceptional--especially for such an inexperienced film maker (it's his first film). The combination of exceptional choices of color	 pacing and music that well-suited the film created a great sense of atmosphere. You really are pulled into the film and that is a credit to the film making. However	 the thing I didn't love was some of the writing. While the basic idea was great	 the ending was just too easy to foresee. I really would have loved the ending had it come as more of a surprise or there to have been an unexpected twist. However	 considering that this film is from someone who shouldn't be able to make such a professional film given his experience	 it bodes well for his future. Good job."	1.0

"If you want to watch a real 'quality' movie get hold of The Eden Formula. This wondrous film must have cost all of $50 to make. It features a wafer thin script	 pathetically bad sets	 lighting and camera work	 and a stop motion	 paper-mache monster that is utterly laughable (it looks like they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit and/or a glove puppet for the monster - but all were equally dreadful). <br /><br />The actors all speak their lines as though they've never seen them before and are reading off a teleprompter. The special effects are way beyond lousy. And the only sad thing is that they dropped the really nifty original title 'Tyranasaurus Wrecks' which sums up exactly what you get for the full 90 minutes.<br /><br />This is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard you break through to the crud that lies underneath. <br /><br />I loved every minute of it."	0.0
Half the reviews were good so i took a chance for $10. Sure Priscilla Barnes had some sex talk but it wasn't much. The whole plot later that she may be the other actress mother & the documentary maker falling for the young woman is stretching it. Its not funny its not that raunchy its not much of anything but a waste of time. Boogie Nights was based on real people that were in the adult industry this is based on nothing that ever happened in the industry. It could have shocked with whats popular today in adult films mocking todays gonzo videos and that big orgy that they had 5 minutes to shoot what a joke a bigger orgy has been done bigger & better decades ago in the early 1970s.	0.0

"The plot line of No One Sleeps is not a bad idea	 and the subject matter is of quite a bit of interest. But	 throughout watching this film	 we were saying aloud	 ""These filmmakers go to the trouble of finding good locations	 the lighting is good	 makeup and hair are good...why is the sound so bad?"" Throughout the film the sound was echoy	 garbled and much of the dialog was unintelligible.<br /><br />There is some good acting in this film	 and I think Jim Thalman is really a good actor. This story	 with some of the same actors	 would have been worth doing as a high-budget film.<br /><br />I just can't reiterate enough - if you have a limited budget	 dedicate more to good sound. Sound is as much a part of a film as the image	 and it's worth doing right. Could've earned a 6."	0.0
"First of all	 the actor they have to play Jesus has blue eyes... half the actors they have playing Jews have blue eyes. Aren't there enough brown-eyed actors out there? Jesus being depicted as having blue eyes is one of my pet peeves. He was a full-blooded Jew! Second of all	 what is it with old English-language movies that are supposed to take place in non-English-speaking countries	 and everybody has English accents? (Another example is David Lean's ""Dr. Zhivago"".) Aren't there enough either Jewish actors or actors who can do a Israeli accent? The movie often is not true to the Scriptures	 and so seems to doubt the legitimacy of Jesus's claim to be the Messiah. In the bible	 when Jesus is baptized by John	 a voice comes from heaven saying ""This is my beloved son	 in whom I am well pleased"" (Matthew 3:17	 Mark 1:11	 Luke 3:22). In the movie	 John the Baptist says this! The screenwriter seems to be trying to portray the believers as crazy	 as well. For example	 in the bible	 the angel Gabriel tells Mary she will become pregnant with the Son of God (Luke 1:26-38)	 but in the movie	 we do not see or hear any angel - Mary appears to be talking to a moonbeam	 and when Mary's mother hears her talking to someone and peeks in on her	 she doesn't hear or see anyone either. Also	 in the movie	 when Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees in the Temple in Jerusalem	 he says	 ""You shall not see me here again	 not until you learn to cry	 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord'	 for I and my father are one and the same."" The correct line (Matthew 23:39 and Luke 13:35)is ""You will not see me again until you say	 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"" Period. Jesus never claimed to be God. The movie cuts out a lot of important parts (the Sermon on the Mount is very expurgated)	 but then spends a lot of time on stuff that isn't even in the bible (a whole scene with Mary Magdalene talking with a john). It seems like the screenwriter	 instead of wanting to do a movie version of the Scriptures	 wanted to make a movie about what he thinks might have really happened behind (and between) the scenes. The movie has one gem though - during the scene where Jesus tells the parable of the Prodigal Son	 at Matthew the tax collector's house	 I had tears streaming down my face. It is the best movie I've seen about Jesus's ministry (but that isn't saying much	 because the others are just terrible). ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" is my favourite movie about Jesus's last days (""The Passion of the Christ"" is way too graphic)	 though I like how ""Jesus of Nazareth""	 instead of just ending with Jesus's death	 continues on and shows his resurrection."	0.0
"I was really looking forward too seeing this movie as it has been advertised as a must-see movie for people that love movies about nature. The movie shows different climates and the animals associated with them by starting at the North Pole and going down south as the movie progresses. The footage from this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful and I many times wondered how on Earth they could have taken some of the shots under water or in the sky. However beautiful	 a large part of the footage I had already seen in the TV series 'Planet Earth'	 narrated by David Attenborough. I found Attenborough's narration of Planet Earth to be much better than the narration of Earth. 'Earth' is an easier movie. It skips much of the scientific detail that Attenborough covers in his 'Planet Earth' series. For instance	 Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young humpback whale	 because there are few predators. Planet Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery	 because the water is low in oxygen and doesn't contain enough nutrients to support very large animals	 like large sharks	 etc. To me	 that's an important difference. That	 together with Attanborough's far superior voice make Planet Earth a far better documentary than Earth. Still	 however	 I think Earth is worth watching for the beautiful footage and the fact that it's easier to understand makes it interesting for children too."	1.0
"**May Contain Spoilers**<br /><br />A dude in a dopey-looking Kong suit (the same one used in KING KONG VS. GODZILLA in 1962) provides much of the laffs in this much-mocked monster flick. Kong is resurrected on Mondo Island and helps out the lunkhead hero and other good guys this time around. The vampire-like villain is named Dr. Who-funny	 he doesn't look like Peter Cushing! Kong finally dukes it out with Who's pride and joy	 a giant robot ape that looks like a bad metal sculpture of Magilla Gorilla. Like many of Honda's flicks this may have had some merit before American audiences diddled around with it and added new footage. The Rankin/Bass animation company had a hand in this mess. They should have stuck to superior children's programs like The Little Drummer Boy."	0.0
"They did it. And	 boy	 did they do it fantastically or what! The BBC finally brought the Doctor back to our screens on a Saturday evening where he belongs! And they did it with style! <br /><br />EPISODE ONE: ""Rose"" - One of the strengths of the new series is Russel T Davies as a writer and executive producer. He's a fan of the show and knows what the other fans want	 but also is an experienced writer in his own right	 so knows what other people want. Another strength	 as perfectly shown here in this first episode	 is Billie Piper and her character of Rose Tyler. Finally the Doctor's companion gets a credible back story and a strong character. Also nice to see the return of the Autons - a nice nod to the Classic Series there.<br /><br />EPISODE TWO: ""The End Of The World"" - In the start of this double bill to show off the TARDIS' strengths	 we end up in a story where special effects is everything! They now have the technology to create real	 believable environments and monsters - no more rubber suits of sorts! Also the hints at the end of this episode regarding the new Doctor's past - very intriguing to kill off all the Time Lords and make him the only one.<br /><br />EPISODE THREE: ""The Unquiet Dead"" - We've had the future	 now lets have the past. The first non-Davies written episode is a little flat in some places	 but this is made up for by Simon Callow's Charles Dickens and the sudden twist in the plot when it is revealed the pitiful Gelf are not so pitiful after all...<br /><br />EPISODE FOUR: ""Aliens Of London"" - The consequences of the Doctor's actions are fully explored in this series	 not least with the repercussions of Rose running off with him. Also	 we have our first cliffhanger; not the best of ones admittedly. The Slitheen are an interesting villain	 though they can look too CGI for their own good.<br /><br />EPISODE FIVE: ""World War Three"" - The second part of this story about the Slitheen suffers mainly from the same problems of the first. Also	 the clips from the next episode coming up at the end of the current episode are annoying and spoil it for people.<br /><br />EPISODE SIX: ""Dalek"" - Yes! We've had the future	 the past	 and the present(ish)	 but now we get to the good stuff - the return of the Doctor's arch-nemesis. Here I think we can complement Christopher Ecclestone - he was brilliant as the Doctor	 and no more so then in this episode	 where we see the pain on his face as he recollects the Time War and the alien nature of him as he almost turns into a Dalek himself.<br /><br />EPISODE SEVEN: ""The Long Game"" - really only a story to act as a prologue for the series finale. Saved by Simon Pegg as the smarmy Editor and Tamsin Grieg in an amusing cameo. The media are controlling us - that's never been done before	 has it...<br /><br />EPISODE EIGHT: ""Father's Day"" - this is a great episode. Full of human emotion and heartache for Rose	 and the true consequences of what happens when you really muck up history. Full marks to Billie Piper here.<br /><br />EPISODE NINE: ""The Empty Child"" - I don't find this kid very scary. Sorry	 but I don't. It's a good episode though	 but the cliffhanger still could have been better - it's those ""Next Time"" bits that spoil them. John Barrowman is introduced here as Captain Jack	 the dashing conman - he's a good actor who's been around for a while but only seemingly noticed now.<br /><br />EPISODE TEN: ""The Doctor Dances"" - Part two of this WW2 story - very well made in historical context terms. A nice upbeat ending	 though a little confusing perhaps for younger viewers when the ""Mummy"" is revealed? <br /><br />EPISODE ELEVEN: ""Boom Town""- probably the weakest of the series	 but that doesn't mean its bad. A nice return for the Slitheen and also an interesting character study of the Doctor and Rose.<br /><br />EPISODE TWELVE: ""Bad Wolf"" - this starts off quite silly	 with some good-hearted humour and cheeky fun making at popular TV shows over her in Blighty. Things turn deadly serious quickly	 though	 and the revelation at the end is the best cliffhanger in the series! <br /><br />EPISODE THRITEEN: ""Parting Of The Ways"" - Goodbye Christopher Ecclestone. A fantastic Doctor in so many ways	 David Tennant is having to really work his socks off to be as good as him. The regeneration scene at the end is beautifully played. Oh	 and the Daleks are back - in the extreme! God bless CGI	 because they'd never be able to pull this off normally! <br /><br />Overall - brilliant! 9/10"	1.0
"What? Is Jamie Foxx supposed to be funny?Does he really believe he is funny?Well	 it's funny watching his confidence in being funny.The man has no identity whatsoever...I mean you can immediately see who his idols are	 Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence	 because he tries really hard to imitate them in most of his movies.The only problem is that he does it bad	 uneven	 and what comes out are some parts where he somewhat looks like Denzel	 with that macho-s**t attitude and then abruptly goes to being Martin Lawrence	 the funny and clumsy-silly comic. There's no personal touch to all that	 I mean he contributes nothing to the personality he tries to sell	 and I'm sure he has nothing to say personally. He really is Mr. Dull-boy in person.<br /><br />I was really hoping Hollywood	 and the black community in America would find somebody better to launch into super stardom	 like Don Cheadle for example	 but perhaps the pathetic Jamie better represents the generation that remixes the old."	0.0
I have seen a lot of bad movies with big actors in it. But this movie was terrible. I have yet to see why people thought it was funny. The idea behind it is stupid. Plus all the things that are supposed to be funny are just dumb. Why anyone would want to watch this more than once just baffles me!	0.0
"Ok	 so	 this is coming a few weeks late	 but it is here. Mostly	 this is because of statements of various negative natures. Starting with the technology. When Star Trek: TOS ran	 special effect technology was extreamely low tec	 and more than that	 the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups. In the 35 years seince TOS premiered	 the crew of Star Trek have become experts at economy.<br /><br />Ultimately	 they have decided	 quite rightly in my mind	 to abandon the look of TOS and reverse engineered TNG et all. So what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from Star Trek II? As for the nits being picked about first contact with the Klingon Empire	 it was presumed based upon comments made by Kirk and Riker that Earth only met the Klingon's in 2200. Nothing was firmly established.<br /><br />Enterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that we've seen in a while. This is what Voyager COULD have been. No series can evolve without a few inconsistancies	 but be thankful that Star Trek has so few. So	 quit gripping and enjoy."	1.0
"I've always believed that David and Bathsheba was a film originally intended for Tyrone Power at 20th Century Fox	 although Gregory Peck does give a good account of himself as King David	 the monarch with a wandering eye.<br /><br />A whole lot of biblical subjects get covered in this film	 adultery	 redemption	 sin	 punishment and generally what God expects from his followers.<br /><br />When you're a king	 even king in a biblically prophesied kingdom you certainly do have a lot perogatives not open to the rest of us. King David has many wives	 including one really vicious one in Jayne Meadows who was the daughter of Saul	 David's predecessor. But his eyes catch sight of Bathsheba out in her garden one evening. Turns out she's as unhappily married to Uriah the Hittite as David is to quite a few women. Uriah is one of David's army captains. David sends for Bathsheba and him being the King	 she comes a runnin' because she's had her eye on him too.<br /><br />What happens	 an affair	 a pregnancy	 and a carefully arranged death for Uriah in a battle. But an all seeing and knowing Deity has caught all of this and is not only punishing David and Bathsheba	 but the entire Kingdom of Israel is being punished with drought	 disease	 and pestilence.<br /><br />The sexist law of the day calls for Bathsheba to have a stoning death. David shows weakness in his previous actions	 but here he steps up to the plate and asks that the whole thing be put on him. He even lays hands on the Ark of the Covenant which was an instant death as seen in the film.<br /><br />My interpretation of it is that God admires guts even if you're wrong and he lets up on David and forgives them both. Bathsheba becomes the mother of Solomon and she and David are the ancestors of several successors in the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah until they're both conquered.<br /><br />Susan Hayward is a fetching Bathsheba caught in a loveless marriage with Uriah played by Kieron Moore. The only thing that gets Moore aroused is a good battle. I liked Kieron Moore's performance as a brave and rather stupid horse's rear. <br /><br />No one can lay the law down like Raymond Massey. His Nathan the Prophet is in keeping with the John Brown character he played in two films	 same intensity. <br /><br />So when His own law called for death	 why did God spare Bathsheba and keep David on the throne. Maybe it was the fact He just didn't want to train a third guy for the job. He'd replaced Saul with David already. <br /><br />But I think the Christian interpretation might be that this was a hint of the New Testament forthcoming	 that one might sin and receive mercy if one asks for it penitently. I'll leave it to the biblical scholars to submit interpretations.<br /><br />Watch the film and you might come up with an entirely new theory."	1.0
"If you want to know what kind of music white people listened to in 1974	 this is the movie for you. But you'll have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins	 too (see my remarks on My Girl 1 for the reference).<br /><br />Indulgent admission: I approached My Girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance	 having just viewed its predecessor. But as an adoptee preparing to finally set upon a search for my birthmother	 My Girl 2 made me look	 with its theme of searching for mother.<br /><br />Put another way	 anything I liked about My Girl 2 had nothing whatsoever to do with My Girl 2	 but relating to a protagonist who asks	 like so many adoptees	 ""who's my mama""? And if there are home movies of my mom in an acting troupe	 I'll be sure to make my own movie about it.<br /><br />People are listless. Movies should not be listless. My Girl 2 (like My Girl 1) is just...listless.<br /><br />Avoid unless you're a complete sap who's comforted by a series of small annoyances."	0.0
"Its taken a few viewings for me to really wrap myself around this one	 but for me Tears of Kali is one of the horror highlights of the 00's and as far as independent horror goes a veritable masterpiece. An anthology horror	 it takes on the story of the fictional Taylor-Eriksson Group	 a cult of sorts based in India whose members set out in search of ultimate self knowledge and healing of the psyche	 with unpleasant results that echo down the years. With bookend segments set in India the film is made chiefly of three stories set in Germany	 illustrating the aftermath of the work of the Taylor-Eriksson Group	 with some pretty nasty gore at times. Its an interesting set up as these things go	 but what sets this film apart is the way the imagery is so carefully set up to develop the films horror. Bad things have been unleashed and the general course of the film is a look at how the quest for self knowledge and ultimate therapy brings horror to patients	 healers and others and the film is loaded with smart visual clues to the power of the dark forces with which it deals	 dark forces unbound by time	 place or even personality. Good examples of this are found in the first story especially	 dealing with a journalist interviewing a lady in a mental hospital. Previous to this story we have seen Lars Eriksson and notably his wonky (lazy?) eye	 we also see him healing or at least comforting a patient. The lady mental patient of the first story is seen in the same stance as Eriksson healing a fellow patient	 also as she wraps up the canvases from the art class that she runs among her fellow patients one of their pictures is seen	 a face with lazy eye like Erikssons. There are also references to folk in minuscule roles	 extras and walk ons having extra sensory perceptions of what is going on in the film	 showing the badness that has been unleashed spreading and able to almost infect others. There is more to the film philosophically than just evil within	 it is a film about death	 suffering and possible redemption too all bound in a structure derived from Hindu beliefs in a fashion that seems like it might just be exploitation but has more relation to actual beliefs than one might expect (at least from the research that I did on wikipedia). Writer/director Andreas Marschall definitely deserves some significant credit for his skill in constructing the film. As well as being thoughtful	 the film is pretty chilling too	 the soundtrack of Bharti India and Panama John has a great eerie piano jingle and there are a couple of notable performances	 Michael Balaun as a sinister doctor and Cora Chilcot as a freaky patient especially good. The third story also has a fine turn from veteran Mathieu Carrière as a faith healer. The biggest problem of the film is that it is not that involving a lot of the time so potential for fear is lost but these and a couple of other performances achieve involvement pretty well. So	 the film isn't quite as gripping as it might be	 the acting occasionally off and the pacing too	 but mostly I thought it was pretty great	 if a shade short of its possible brilliance. Well worth a look for adventurous horror fans I think."	1.0
"A quiet	 sweet and beutifully nostalgic movie on how it is to be confronted with old friends and surroundings from your youth with all that memories and the problems and sorrows of the present with you. A movie that makes you feel good. All the ingredients are here: old jelousy	 rivalry	 friendship and loyalty. Mischief	 nightly fridge-raids and all the other fun stuff that we all remember from our summer camps. All the characters get the opportunity for a week to experience this again as the old camp-leader now is retiring and want to meet the children from the golden years of the camp. All of them are now in their thirties and in the middle of their careers."	1.0
"Almost a two-person play	 and as such the dialog and the performances of the leads will be important. Neither are particularly good. This might have been stronger	 in fact	 if it had first been crafted as a two-person play	 and then worked into a film.<br /><br />Anyway	 a twitchy vampire who seems slightly autistic becomes infatuated with a stripper (as a result of watching too much porn in his crappy home). He wants to have her tell him about the daylight. He would have been better off finding someone with a day job	 or someone who excels at painting a picture with words like a poet	 but then they might not have a hot bod.<br /><br />After he gets her to do whatever he wants (and he's not terribly good at it)	 he intends to feed on her at 6 AM	 at which point the sun rises. Much is made of that deadline	 despite the fact that he also says that he can go without feeding	 it will just make him hungrier. Additionally	 he claims he can't let the stripper go	 since she knows about him	 but he lets a number of other people go who learn what he is. There are a lot of inconsistencies.<br /><br />Why this vampire chooses to live in a house so poorly boarded up that light from streetlamps and neighboring buildings pours in as if it were daytime	 I'm not sure. With all the time in the world	 you'd think he'd have done a better job	 or fixed the place up a bit. He's clearly not a wealthy vampire.<br /><br />This is supposedly a remake	 and I'm curious to see the original version of this	 Dance of the Damned. Although	 that was directed by Katt Shea	 and the other films she directed for Corman (Stripped to Kill	 StK II) were pretty bad."	0.0
"this film needs to be seen. the truest picture of what is going on in the world that I've seen since Darwin's Nightmare. Go see it! and If you're lucky enough to have it open in your city	 be sure to see it on the big screen instead of DVD. The writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for the ideas to come through	 though hardly perfect. Joan Cusack is amazing	 and the rest of the cast is good too. It's inspiring that John Cusack got this movie made	 and	 I believe	 he had to use some of his own money to do it. It's a wild	 absurd ride	 obviously made without the resources it needed	 but still succeeds. Jon Stewart	 Steven Colbert	 SNL	 even Bill Maher haven't shown the guts to say what this film says."	1.0

Nobody	 I can tell you that.And I really love the story on why Paul wanted Peter Falk for the part.Peter was an actor who made his own father laugh.And Peter certainly made me laugh in this movie.It's just hilarious when they go fishing.And how the old guy beats the younger one in the game of pool and then beats him with the stick.The movie is often very funny and I found myself laughing several times.But it can also be touching from time to time.You couldn't tell a story any better than it is told here."	1.0
"If I accidentally stumbled across this script in textual form i would read it and maybe laugh. I would not	 however laugh at the points in the film where the director would seem to want me to laugh. Although I am still not altogether sure where these are. I don't care if this is Woody Allen	 this writer cannot write dialogue	 or at least he cannot knowingly write dialogue then draw performances from actors capable of drawing laughter from even the most ticklish of clowns. For example:<br /><br />(paraphrase) ""I'm an art historian	 i'm looking to get a job in an art gallery."" <br /><br />OK	 so it states the fact but honestly	 do you know of any art historians who would say that? How would you answer? <br /><br />""Really? An art gallery? who would've thought it?""<br /><br />The entire script is littered with the kind of tawdry quasi-intellectualism that i would not have expected from such a respected character writer. I admit that I have no knowledge of Allen's other work and	 judging by this one i don't want to start learning. The characters are loathsome without exception	 an attempt to illustrate that we all suffer from the human condition? Or really really poor character writing? You be the judge."	0.0
Arthur is middle aged rich 'kid' who drinks like a fish. Arthur does what he feels like and says whatever comes into his mind. He likes to boast about his riches and knows that he is a spoiled brat. He spends money on people he don't know and finds everything funny. Arthur must marry a high class girl to inherit a big fortune but he falls in love with a poor waitress Liza Minnelli (she looks really weird).<br /><br />This is a damn funny film. I watched this film because a very famous Indian film 'Sharabee' is based on the character of Arthur. Although 'Sharabee' is definitely inspired by 'Arthur' I think they are two different films. 'Arthur' is just fun. Its very corny at times. There are so many fantastic one liners in the film. Its not a laugh riot but it has some fantastic moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his fiancé's father and he keeps talking about the 'moose'. Duddley Moore sure has some comic timing. He is very good with words and body language. I loved the scene where he talks standing to a seated couple in the hotel about a 'small' country and he keeps talking to husband and wife in two different directions. John Gielgud got an Oscar for this film. I don't know that actor. I don't think he did a great job but may be if I watched more of his work I may agree in future. Movie has some flat patches but not very long ones. looking forward to watch the sequel.	1.0

"This film was terrible. I have given it the high score of 2 as I have seen worse	 but very few.<br /><br />From the clichéd start of having the end of the film at the start and going back to the start at the end this film used everything in the box of tricks used in film making just for the sake of it	 like a kid with too many toys. There was the endless	 boring repetitive narration	 slow motion	 freeze frame	 flashbacks and merged images etc - none of which made a dull film any better.<br /><br />It is called ""16 years of alcohol""	 but there was little drinking or drunkeness and no depiction of withdrawal with the film jumping about all over the place with no coherent sense. The story was badly written and extremely pretentious and the direction was equally poor and it is a shame that people have put up further money for more films by Mr Jobson	 previously know for being in a rubbish group and on TV making as much sense as this film does.<br /><br />I found it a major struggle to see this to the end but in the hope of it getting better I carried on to the bitter but it really was a waste of time and I would have been better off not bothering."	0.0

The music really fit the movie perfectly. The acting was great; loved the mice!! You really ""hated"" Lady Tremain and the step-sisters; they were just awful.

"Actually they could not have chosen a better diversified actor to portray Little Richard than Leon. He captures Little Richard to a most believable essence. The outfits where wonderful and any person watching this movie will definitely keep a smile on their face through the entire movie. Although the movie is a little long	 it keeps your attention with the personality and outfits of Little Richard in mind. The ending should have taken a direction of moving Little Richard more into the present where you could see him as he has aged into this new millennium. He will always be the King of Rock-N-Roll as far as I am concerned regardless of what the other media says."	1.0
"Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have least heard of - it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it. But it is still great - a fiery Duke of Wellington and a fat foolish Dr Johnson (writer of the first dictionary in England) make this series one to be reckoned with. There are still more hilarious one-liners to be delivered in this series	 and it brings out the humour in a lesser-known era - in historically accurate and enjoyable episodes. Blackadder's third outing is not the most famous and well-known of the lot	 but Rowan Atkinson's role as a butler to a stupid prince is a funny and effectively done one	 and Hugh Laurie is at his best in this series. Very good! 9/10"	1.0
"It is always sad when ""fringe"" movies such as this are overlooked by the majority of filmgoers. ""Panic"" is a wonderfully compelling and poignant study of a character who feels trapped in the pointlessness of his own life.<br /><br />William H. Macy	 as Alex	 is as convincing as always. This fine actor seems to have a special talent for pulling at your heartstrings	 no matter how flawed his characters may be; we may not always condone the lifestyles of the protagonists he plays	 but the emotions of fear and confusion that he evokes in us are often all too painfully familiar. The title	 ""Panic	"" initially seems paradoxical	 given the lack of overt emotion. At one point Alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry. Yet	 as this story unfolds	 it becomes increasingly obvious that rage and desperation	 not indifference	 are the driving forces behind this man's existence.<br /><br />More than once I was reminded of his performance in ""Fargo	"" another strongly character-driven movie. In both ""Fargo"" and ""Panic"" we witness a middle aged man who somehow seems to have stepped out of synch with the rest of life. He has lost his way	 and the only way back deceptively appears to be though the darkness. He knows he is making bad choices	 but desperation overpowers self-control and common sense.<br /><br />Alex connects with Sarah	 a 23 year old woman (mesmorizingly played by Neve Campbell)	 whom he meets in a doctor's office. Thematically	 this union is less coincidence	 more the work of fate. Alex finds a certain comfort being with Sarah	 sensing perhaps that she is a fellow drifter	 like him	 someone who has lost her way and is floating aimlessly through the rest of her life	 waiting powerlessly for its inevitable conclusion.<br /><br />Opting for movies such as this is a shrewd and convincing way for Neve Campbell to answer those critics who question her acting abilities. Too often it is the characters she has played who are the weakness	 offering Campbell no depth in which to flex her acting muscles. This performance	 however	 may be an eye-opener for many.<br /><br />In a perfect movie world	 not only would there be many more films like ""Panic	"" but also they would reach and be appreciated by a much wider audience. If you watch movies for the richness and depth of characterization	 rather than merely the latest state-of-the-art special effects	 then	 for you	 ""Panic"" is unmissable. A+."	1.0
"I just want to start by saying this is the first review of a film I have done on the net. I felt the need to warn people about this film because it truly is one of the worst films I have ever seen. After reading interviews with the director he says he respects constructive criticism and so i will try to avoid bashing the film just for the sake of it and offer my opinions as to why i found it to be so catastrophically terrible.<br /><br />1. The actors. I know the budget may not have allowed for great thespians but with Nicholson working in the industry for over ten years surely he knew some actors who were at least average.<br /><br />2. The incredibly lame make up and special effects. Once again budget obviously interfered with what was originally intended but after working in make up for so many years there is really no excuse.<br /><br />3. The obvious similarities to Hostel. Whilst not being exactly a rip off it sure does try to cash in on the former films success. Only problem is Roth knew where he was going and exactly how to get there...<br /><br />4. The music. Not at all creepy or haunting not even sickening just plain annoying.<br /><br />5. The script in general. All dialogue was forced and terrible! Also the sub plots about the theatre and the guy who comes in to save them were weak as and almost like an afterthought.<br /><br />6. The editing. WTF. How jarring	 and not in a good way. nuf said.<br /><br />Seriously I would like to hear the director's thoughts on my post (he no doubt frequents his pages on IMDb.) cause buddy... what were you thinking. Surely at some point during either the shooting or editing you realised what a turkey yolu had on your hands... Sorry I don't want to be harsh but you must have more talent than this i hope your next feature that gutterballs movie or wahtever is better	 hopefully practice makes progress.<br /><br />But in the mean time avoid this like the plague.

"Another detailed work on the subject by Dr Dwivedi takes us back in time to pre-partioned Panjab. Dr Dwivedi chose a difficult subject for his movie debut. He has worked on all meticulous details to bring the story to life. The treatment of the subject is very delicate.<br /><br />Even though we have not been to the region during that time	 the sets and costumes look real. Unlike most movies made on partition	 this one focuses not on the gory details of violence to attract audience	 but on its after-effects. The characters come to life. Priyanshu Chatterjee has given an impressive performance. Manoj Bajpai has acted his heart out showing the plight of a guilt-ridden man. The rest of the cast has done a good job too."	1.0
"Especially for a time when not much science fiction was being filmed (1973)	 this is a terrific vision of a future where everything has gone wrong. Too many people	 and nothing works. The only people who can live in comfort are the rich. It's set in New York in 2022 (I think)	 and it reminds you of your worst vision of Calcutta.<br /><br />I got to appreciate Charlton Heston's acting after seeing him in Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. He was (maybe is) capable of portraying a range of heroic or semi-heroic people. Here	 he is torn between being a cop who is just a little bit corrupt (taking rare food treats from the rich)	 and being totally corrupt (actively condoning evil). <br /><br />The movie all seems to take place at night	 and sweat is dripping off everyone	 except in one of the rare air-conditioned apartments. Even though I hadn't seen it before	 I knew the famous ending (which will not here be revealed)	 but the ending is certainly foreshadowed.<br /><br />Great scenes with Edward G. Robinson: going to the council (made up of elderly Jews with heavy accents	 so it seems)	 where the truth is revealed. And then going off to the Thanatopsis to check out.<br /><br />Gritty	 pre-Star Wars dystopian science fiction."	1.0
"Last year we were treated to two movies about Truman Capote writing the book from which this film was made - Capote and Infamous.<br /><br />I cannot imagine a movie like this being made in 1967. A stark	 powerful and chillingly brutal drama; elevated to the status of a film classic by the masterful direction of Richard Brooks (Elmer Gantry	 Cat on a Hot Tin Roof	 The professional	 Blackboard Jungle).<br /><br />It is interesting that Robert Blake	 who starred in this film	 has had so many problems of late that may be related to his portrayal of a killer in this film.<br /><br />This is a film that stays with you after viewing."	1.0
"1st watched 2/16/2002 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery??/Thriller with too many ridiculous plot twists. Despite the very talented cast this movie is way too predictable and just downright under-estimates it's audience. The movie-going public is not stupid and I hope will not keep filling certain stars pockets again and again despite what they are involved with. We think that this movie is going to be about something with Connery's conviction against capitol punishment in the beginning but it turns out to be nothing but a standard	 contrived for the audience's sake	 run of the mill	 let's never get it over with	 thriller. We are pulled into every silly switch in character	 as they are portrayed to us when it's needed in the story	 and we're ready for this thing to be over way before it ends. Yes there is some good acting here	 especially from Blair Underwood	 Fishburne	 and Ed Harris in a psycho-supporting role but the story does not work from almost the beginning to the very long-awaited end."	0.0
"Astaire and Rogers at the height of their popularity. In 1936 Americans thought of the Navy as a place for song and dance. WWII was still a few years away. Fred and Ginger dance up the town.<br /><br />The plot is decent	 but who cares... By the way	 notice the cameo roles for Betty Grable and a glamorous Lucile Ball.<br /><br />A load of Irving Berlin songs	 including the famous ""Let's Face the Music and Dance"". In that scene	 Ginger's heavy swooping dress smacks Fred in the face during one of her spins and almost knocks him unconscious. Fred insisted on keeping the take as the dancing was superb nonetheless.<br /><br />Ginger once commented that she was a better dancer than Fred	 since she had to do all the same moves	 in step	 and backwards...<br /><br />Come to think of it	 Fred's voice was nice too. The man was effortless in motion.<br /><br />Here's a movie to cozy up on the couch with a loved-one	 kick off the shoes	 and enjoy the entertainment."	1.0
"I usually don't walk out of a movie	 but halfway thru I did. This movie promised something different	 but I kept thinking haven't I seen that before? Spoiler Alert! Back in 1	 the spaceship crashes and lands on earth	 well	 all these years later	 with a super adult on board no less	 this thing still manages to burn up and crash! What	 this advanced civilization can't seem to develop landing gear? For an industry that's so liberal	 we get to see another Woody Allen movie	 no blacks please!

"Actress Patty Duke wrote an insightful	 funny	 rough-hewn book about her career as an actress	 her crazy-quilt love-life	 and her manic depressive episodes and suicide attempts which almost put her away for good. With this rich material to draw from (and Patty playing herself in the final act)	 one would think a crack TV-director like Gilbert Cates could bring it all together on film	 but ""Call Me Anna"" is a pale shadow of Duke's autobiography. For those who haven't read the book	 the sketchy narrative (leaping forward in time) isn't absorbing	 we are never allowed to get our bearings with what's happening	 and the production seems stunted by a low budget. The actors are miscast	 and the value of having Duke herself finally appear does not pay off--the film's phony reality is so thick at this point that Patty can't bring stability to the scenario. It appears as if the producers were sincere enough (and consciousness-minded) to anxiously steer the film towards Duke's ultimate diagnosis and mental freedom	 but they left out many dramatic opportunities in the process."	0.0
"After seeing You've Got Mail and feeling disappointed	 I decided to see the original movie which inspired this one	 The Shop Around the Corner. I was amazed at this movie. It's a true gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all times. The acting is so perfect	 the story is so beautiful	 that if you haven't seen it	 I wish to urge you to see it today. I'm not against re-makes and sometimes I like the new version more than the original one	 but this time have to admit that You've Got Mail is a poor adaption of this classic. Don't miss it	 go to your video store and rent The Shop Around the Corner today!"	1.0
"My teacher taped this and showed it to us in Child Care to demonstrate how teen pregnancy affects people. It just demonstrated how teen pregnancy affects a childish jock not properly educated on how sex works and a whiny	 unloved girl who throws fruit when angry and couldn't tell she was with the wrong man even if he wore a sign stating he was such. I wouldn't be surprised if the father of the baby had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script. Stacy's (the carrier of the baby) mother is a riot. She is oblivious to the fact her daughter is past the age of four and is seemingly unshaken when people spy on her through her dining room window. Bobby's (the father) best friend's name is Dewey	 and is an obvious rip off of Sean Penn's character in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This movie is horrid	 simply because none of the characters are believable. Thank goodness it's only made for TV	 limiting the public's chances of viewing it."	0.0
"I loved ""The Curse of Frankenstein"" so much that I rushed out to get ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" to see Cushing at it again...even if it was without Chistopher Lee this time. To my great disappointment	 this movie not only does without Lee	 but it does without Frankenstein's Monster altogether! Was it a case of ""If we can't get Lee	 we won't have a monster at all""? Why would they do that? The monster is half the fun of the whole thing!! This film is dedicated solely to the study of Baron Frankenstein and his quest to finish experiments he had begun in brain transplants before ending up in an asylum. I found the script extremely weak	 with the need to suspend disbelief forced upon the audience a little too much. I'm willing to suspend a fair amount	 but this movie got fairly ridiculous	 which took me out of the film rather than immersing me in it.<br /><br />Peter Cushing	 though	 is absolutely brilliant playing pure evil in this film. For being one of the most beloved actors and notoriously sweet men	 he sure could play menacing and malevolent extremely well. The supporting cast is competent	 but has little to do	 even the young doctor and his fiancée blackmailed into helping Frankenstein. A bumbling police chief is introduced	 along with his put-upon sidekick	 to generate some comic relief	 then they are completely dropped from the movie! Why? We are led to believe that the police chief will be the main nemesis of the Baron	 then we are led to believe it will be the young doctor	 and then it ends up being the victim of Frankenstein's brain transplant experiment. There was no tension	 we weren't invested in the ""creature""	 and the ending was left so ambiguous as to leave one unsatisfied because it is so clear they are setting up another sequel.<br /><br />Also	 there are virtually no ""horror"" elements. Yes	 there is a beheading in the beginning (off-camera)	 and we are treated to the sounds of Cushing cutting the tops of two men's skulls off (again	 off camera)	 and there is the most unsettling and thoroughly unnecessary rape scene (90% of which is	 again	 off-camera). I understand that there is a love of ""letting the audience imagine it all	 for their imaginations are far worse than what we can show""	 but come on	 if you're not going to give us a Monster	 then at least let us SEE the few ""horrific"" elements you do choose to include. Showing us a skeleton in the lab lit with a green light is just not scary.<br /><br />On top of a weak script	 I thought the directing was mostly flat. There were a couple of nice shots	 but otherwise no excitement	 atmosphere	 or suspense was generated. The same director did ""Curse"" back in 1958 and I thought it was brilliantly directed...guess he was as uninspired by this film as I was.<br /><br />The movie gets a 4 out of 10 from me strictly for Peter Cushing's powerful	 nuanced performance...beyond that	 I found little in this movie worth recommending. Instead	 my suggestion is to watch ""The Curse of Frankenstein"" and see a truly great Hammer horror film."	0.0

"Remade today	 this film would be a very creepy	 very disturbing dark comedy. Stalking	 obsession	 and a web of lies and manipulations are given a 1948 gloss of aren't-they-cute harmlessness.

"I can't understand why so many peoples praised this show. Twin peaks is one of the most boring titles I have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />Now I have seen all season 1 episodes	 and seeing season 2 episode 1. Simply I can't take this show anymore.<br /><br />1) Where is the proper induction in criminal investigation?<br /><br />In season 1	 there was a scene that agent Cooper throws stones to a bottle. Can you guess why he did that? He just want to identify murderer by doing this 'joke' while mentioning supernatural ability given by Tibet dream. Wow!!!<br /><br />2) There are too many unnecessary scenes in this show.<br /><br />For example	 season 2 started with a 'funny' scene that a dumb old man serves agent Cooper with a cup of milk while Cooper are laying down on the floor.( He got the gun shoots in his belly already. ) This old man is doing nothing but saying some dumb comments. That's all.<br /><br />This scene is really boring and even long ( 3 min 30 sec.... It's like Hell. )<br /><br />I would read some comic books rather than see this show anymore."	0.0
"If this movie proves only one thing	 it's that Keaton is	 was and always will be a comic at heart	 even when dodging bullets	 heading for the electric chair and getting at the wrong end of an information line in prison.<br /><br />But ""Johnny Dangerously"" goes on to prove even more. In the '80s	 the ZAZ boys (Zucker	 Abrahams	 Zucker) were the pinnacle in the world of genre spoofs. But there were several pretenders to the throne. This time	 Amy (""Fast Times at Ridgement High"") Heckerling tries her hand	 with an amazing amount of television writers behind the script (go and check). <br /><br />This slap-happy slapstick spoof of the 1930's cops-and-""gag""sters movies throws just about every cliche for a loop and even adds a few cliches that didn't exist way back when.<br /><br />And not only is the ever-dependable Keaton on hand as the Johnny of the title	 but so are such funny guys and dolls as Piscopo	 Henner	 Stapleton	 Boyle	 Dunne	 DeVito	 Walston and just about every other actor in Hollywood that happened to walk into the immediate vicinity. You'd be surprised by how many faces you'll recognize. I know I was.<br /><br />And the jokes? Well	 when they start out	 they come at you fast and furious	 like a machine gun. There are too many to count in the beginning	 topped off with a crazy theme song by Weird Al Yankovic. But you have to watch for when they reload. And they have to reload a little too often. <br /><br />Everyone tries	 they seem to be having fun and I was laughing a good amount of the time. In the end	 though	 there was plenty of time to think about how certain scenes could have been funnier - not usually the best thing to think about after watching a comedy.<br /><br />But for a slow night when there's nothing good on TV	 pop in ""Johnny"" and be ready for some ""Dangerously"" serious laughter.<br /><br />Eight stars. Check out ""Johnny Dangerously""... don't be a ""bastidge""."	1.0
"Being that I am a true product of the hip-hop and electronic dance music generation	 this is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time. Beat Street	 although not as ""authentic"" in some respects as Wild Style	 is a film that is guaranteed to tug the heart strings of anyone who takes pride in the culture of urban sample/DJ-based music and electro-club culture.<br /><br />Although I will admit that at times the dialogue is somewhat cheesy	 you can't help but feel for the characters	 and ultimately ""wish you were there"" for the beginnings of hip-hop culture in New York City in the early eighties. The b-boy battle scene at the Roxy nightclub (a real-life	 real-time competition between the legendary Rock Steady Crew and the NYC Breakers) is just as essential to a hip-hop fan's archives as any classic album. Watch some of the breakers' moves in slow-motion if possible to truly appreciate the athletic and stylistic expertise of a seasoned B-boy/B-girl. All praises due to the Zulu Nation!!!"	1.0
"This was god awful. The story was all over the place and more often than not I was confused because of horrible editing. I felt no sympathy for anyone because their characters were not developed enough. They were extremely superficial people with no dimension. Cheesy	 cheesy stereotypes with subplots that went nowhere. The stripper chick was just a distraction	 even if she was decent looking. I don't know what this was attempting to be	 but how shocked was I when they showed this trash on Sundance? I almost cancelled my subscription. You'd think a channel like that would show more quality films. There are much	 much better gay and lesbian themed films out there. ""The Celluloid Closet"" is an excellent documentary. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Wigstock: The Movie"". I'm sure there are others that have slipped my mind at the moment	 but what I'm trying to say is that this just wasn't worth it. If you catch it on TV	 ok	 but otherwise don't bother.<br /><br />There were maybe three or four shots that looked really nice (sad I can count them on one hand)	 otherwise the cinematography was pretty crappy as well. The lighting was way off in a lot of places. I think some of the effects were used to try and add to something that just had practically nothing going for it.<br /><br />I can't deny Johnny Rebel is pretty hot (without the blond hair of course). Too bad his acting did nothing for me. Stick with real porn	 buddy.<br /><br />3/10."	0.0
"It's really rare that you get an inside view at a media deception that has been so widely reported as official ""truth"" and caught so many ""news"" agencies with their pants down. This movie	 in my view	 deserves every price there is in journalism - it's objective (yes!)	 courageous and a real ""scoop"". It can do without comment	 fake scenes or leading questions - everyone	 including Chavez equally gets to make fools of themselves in their own words. The filmmakers ""only"" had to keep track of events and keep their cameras rolling.<br /><br />The Venezuelan elite teaches us ""How to depose of a President and sell it as a victory of democracy"". It's amazing that they lost in the end - so far. From what I know	 the biggest TV station involved only got its terrestrial license revoked	 they're still broadcasting via cable and satellite. I highly doubt whether George W. or Barack Obama would be that tolerant after an attempted coup. But then	 they don't have to worry.<br /><br />The fact that the ""Chavez supporters shoot innocent civilians"" scam was so willingly repeated around the world reveals just how biased the so-called ""free"" (established) media really has become	 or has always been	 only more so. An important lesson to anyone interested in what ""really"" goes on in the world.<br /><br />The famous ""objectivity"" challenge always comes into play when journalists dare to oppose the mainstream view	 or reveal unwelcome facts that accuse ""us"" - it has been true with the effects of the Atomic bomb	 the US secret history of spreading ""democracy"" around the world or the Iraq war that	 according to Johns Hopkins	 has killed 1	3 million Iraquis by now	 not to mention the 60	000 Afghans (in 2003) that are never mentioned. To be objective	 Saddam Hussein was less damaging to his people than the US. And the US is ready & willing to be more damaging to the Iranians that he was.<br /><br />I'm quite curious about the upcoming trial of some Khmer Rouge leaders before the International Tribunal in The Hague	 whether there will be any mention of ""our"" involvement in supporting and training Pol Pot's guerrillas in the 80's	 when they had been largely defeated by the Vietnamese. Probably not.<br /><br />All the more reason to turn to the Independent media for balance	 if not exposure of fraud."	1.0
"Casting Jack Cassidy as Ken Frankin was sheer brilliance. Cassidy personified arrogance	 confidence	 charm and wit - all with a condescending	 evil little smirk on his face. In my opinion	 Jack Cassidy is by far the best murderer (having appeared three times) in the Columbo series. This particular (and first) performance	 is my favorite Columbo episode ever - hands down. A fresh faced Steven Spielberg did amazing camera work (yes	 there were a couple of camera shadows on the actors at times)capturing the nuances and banter at different and intriguing angles between Columbo and Franklin. Also	 the panoramic and tight in shots at Big Bear Lake	 CA (Franklin's cabin home) were very impressive.<br /><br />If you have not yet seen this episode	 then you owe it to yourself to do so - it's a true masterpiece.<br /><br />Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic personality was highly infectious. His death in 1976	 at age 49 was very sad and indeed very tragic - he surely had his best years ahead of him. Rest in Peace Jack	 you will live on for eternity through your great work."	1.0
"I have read over 100 of the Nancy Drew books	 and if you are not bright enough to catch on yet	 Nancy Drew the movie was of a YOUNGER Nancy Drew	 not the 18-year-old that doesn't go to school that all of the books are about. This was when she was sixteen. So naturally	 she would of not as been as smart as the one in the book considering she is only in the 10th grade. Other than that	 I thought the movie was very cute. It was clean and appropriate for everyone. It was funny at times. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. She was articulate	 in character	 and cute. I liked the awkwardness that Nancy and Ned had around each other because they obviously were not old enough to be in a serious relationship like they have in the books. It was a cute	 PG movie that I throughly enjoyed because I	 unlike most people my age	 enjoy movies without sex	 drugs	 or profanity."	1.0
I watched the DVD of this movie which also comes with an excellent commentary track (in English). It seems in Cambodia (the subtitles in English say the character is speaking Thai but the movie says Cambodia)a very violent evil man is raising boys to be killers using starvation and training them to fight and kill. He sends Pang to kill some people in China and during the killings a cop's partner is killed. The cop Wai is a loose cannon who is worried about his father who is also a cop who was shot and is in a coma. Wai's chief is his dad's friend and is worried about Wai's erratic behavior. He doesn't know Wai was the one who caught his dad in dealing with drug dealers and shot him and put him into the coma. Pang escapes and hides in a squalid landfill shack where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and keeps repeating her father won't let her leave (Pang doesn't speak Chinese and doesn't understand this but saves her from her father who appears to be having sex with her maybe this is the reason for Cat III). Wai becomes more and more obsessed with getting Pang but Pang is almost unstoppable. Even after Pang steals a boat and takes the woman to his home where they are married and she becomes pregnant Wai follows and joins the evil man (who's training the boys)making a deal to fight and train so he can get Pang. There is a big showdown between Wai and Pang with the terribly abused woman the major victim and leaving Wai dead and Pang cutting out his child from the dead mother only to die and leave him as the possible next boy to be raised as a killer. This film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack. There are many very brutal violent scenes. The woman having a long nail pulled out of her foot. Knives to the neck and torso. Guns fired directly to the head. And several very intense beatings. It maybe grim intense and downbeat but it is definitely worth seeing.	1.0
"I watched this hoping to find out something I didn`t know about modern history`s most infamous man and couldn`t help thinking that history has been rewritten in HITLER:THE RISE OF EVIL . Hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to have one of her admirer`s shot . Hitler turned up with a gun in his hand to arrest Ernst Rohm . Forgive me for asking but haven`t the writers confused Adolph Hitler with Tony Montana from SCARFACE ? That`s bad enough but what really offended me was that there`s entire chunks of historical context missing in this mini series . Germany lost the first world war and the allied powers made Germany pay a heavy price for doing so. It was this economic environment that led the German people to have someone - anyone - to restore their pride and that`s why they turned to Nazism . The German humiliation of the 1920s caused by the allied powers seems to be entirely missing therefore there is no way that HITLER:THE RISE OF EVIL can be taken seriously as a historical document	 and I haven`t even mentioned that Himmler and Goering are conspicous by their absence <br /><br />There is one positive point about the mini series and that`s Robert Carlyle in the title role . Okay some of his mannerisms are wrong and his voice is a little too loud ( Archive recordings show that Hitler had a soft seductive voice ) but Carlyle is a charismatic actor and he does manage to communicate Hitler`s own charisma on screen . Comments in the British press that Carlyle resembles the synth player from Sparks more than Adolph Hitler are unfounded and he gives one of the better interpretations of Hitler.<br /><br />I liked the performance by Robert Carlyle but I hated everything else about this mini series and wondered why on earth it was made in the first place . There`s nothing to recommend it to serious history fans"	0.0
"In Mexico this movie was aired only in PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life	 is a true example about a good German and specially	 about a good man. The conversations between Tukur's character and the Nazi prosecutor are specially interesting. A true ideas' war: two different Germans	 both with faith in there believes. Bonhoeffer was a very complex person: man	 freedom fighter	 boyfriend	 churchman and a great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is outstanding as Bonhoeffer. I recommended this film a lot	 specially in this difficult times for the planet. In Mexico we don't know a lot about Pastor Bonhoeffer life and legacy	 this is a great work for rescue a forgotten hero."	1.0
"Antonioni was aiming for another hip masterpiece	 this time on the other side of the Atlantic than ""Blow up"". It wasn´t the success with critics and youth like the former though. Why? Maybe because it was a European´s view of America filled with clichés that didn´t work then and that have not aged well. (The revolutionary students at the beginning is embarrassing.)<br /><br />Maybe when it was released big blockbuster movies and those aimed specifically at the youth market seemed dated. If it had been released a year before maybe hippes in deserts would have seemed fresh... It´s a very interesting film tho	 very beautifully shot with some brilliant and Antonionian scenes in between	 like the love-making in the desert	 the stillness of the desert mansion and the explosive ending... That the leads were two amateurs didn´t help. They were beautiful but inexperienced. Mark Freshette is slightly better than Daria Halprin. It would have been so much better with proper actors! Maybe Michelle Phillips or a young Jessica Lange... The dialog is actually quite funny and poignant at times	 tho you wouldn´t know the way the lines are delivered...<br /><br />A very intersting document of the late sixties definitely worth a look for the photography and the soundtrack...."	1.0
"There are some Stallone movies I like	 but this movie didn't meet my low expectations. I found this movie hard to believe. For example	 a bunch of terrorists who crash land in the wilderness are prepared to survive for at least two days. Also	 in all this wilderness Stallone and company keep running across bridges and ladders that provide convenient short-cuts or plot devices. Also	 the Treasury cops don't seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue people. Also	 bad guys who couldn't hit the side of a barn with really high-tech looking automatic weapons.<br /><br />I liked John Lithgow's villain initially	 but the character is such a complete psychopath that he doesn't care at all about any of his own bad guys	 or all of them getting killed.

"Steve Carell once again stars in a light romantic movie about choices	 family and pressure. By judging on the plot and cover art of the movie I was expecting a flat-out comedy	 lots of laughs and unrealistic elements	 but I guess I was wrong. Sure the movie had some comedy	 but it felt much more of a light Drama to me and Steve Carell once again gave a great performance. The movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element I found. But	 the ending felt a little bit rushed and predictable. Through-out	 the cinematography was great	 the acting was great and the message it delivered was obvious but yet still very important. Though	 it came down to old	 flat and predictable ending. I'd reckon if different choices were made at the end of the movie (perhaps for the bad	 even) this movie would get better publicity. Still a fun movie."	1.0
"Okay I had heard little about this film	 so when it came on the movie channels on TV	 I wanted to watch it	 being a horror aficionado.

It wasn't scary; Ill give it to Roth (who I think is a young hack); characters do change throughout the film	 ala ""Cube"".<br /><br />HOWEVER despite your typical ""rats in a cage"" scenario- who will turn on who	 etc.	 it was pretty average horror.<br /><br />A few points: 1.) What was with that kid? I'm not even talking about him being weird and biting people. I'm talking about the whole ""slow motion karate kicking""	 what was that? 2.) Okay I know Rider's character liked Jordan Ladd's	 but as a young woman	 I was appalled that he just went ahead and molested her in her sleep. Uh	 thats illegal.<br /><br />3.) Roth was in the movie just so Roth could be in the movie. Talk about pointlessly writing yourself in! 4.) What was with the deputy? 5.) So she was just instantly pulled apart by the dog?

"I hate to throw out lines like this	 but in this case I feel like I have to: the American remake of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst film I have seen in theaters in the last 5 years. There	 I said it. And now that I have gotten that out of my system	 please let me explain why.<br /><br />""When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage	 a curse is born. The curse gathers in that place of death. Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury."" That is the premise of THE GRUDGE and I will admit it sounds intriguing. Unfortunately	 the filmmakers take it no further. Those who encounter the ""curse"" are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get. You want more? Well too bad. Some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of THE GRUDGE is to scare you. The problem is that when there is no plot to speak of	 creepy images and sounds can only go so far. Director Takashi Shimizu	 pulling a George Sluizer and remaking his own original film(s)	 valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour  by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over. It pretty much unfolds like this:<br /><br />-person walks into house<br /><br />-something flashes by the camera and/or a strange sound is heard <br /><br />-person goes to investigate<br /><br />-sound starts to get loud<br /><br />-person sees a ghost<br /><br />-loud scream and/or cat screech<br /><br />-cut to black<br /><br />Before the audience is even given a hint of plot	 this exact same scenario unfolds 5 times in the first hour. The first time was actually somewhat creepy. Each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on. By the time the end of the film rolled around	 my friend and I were laughingly wondering if this scene would end ""with a loud scream and a cut to black."" We were never proved wrong.<br /><br />The film has no liner storyline	 instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled. I have no problem with non-linear storytelling when it is done right. The film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme or reason. I haven't seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER 2. And this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had. If you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death	 how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic? And why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone?<br /><br />Obviously greenlit the second the American version of THE RING made $15 million its first weekend	 THE GRUDGE is nothing but calculated imitation disguised as an actual movie. The scariest things about THE GRUDGE are that it made $40 million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the ""scariest movie ever made."" I wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see THE GRUDGE?"	0.0
"This must be one of the worst Swedish movies ever made. <br /><br />It is embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to become a movie and shown in cinemas as recently as year 2006.<br /><br />I've never seen so many visible sponsored products in one and the same movie. It shouldn't be that obvious. <br /><br />I can't understand why so many known actors even thought the idea to even be visible in a movie like this. If I had any respect for some of the known actors in this movie before I saw the movie	 it is gone for sure now. <br /><br />I've heard that there will be a follow up movie to this one and I can't understand how that is even possible."	0.0
"But if you like the muppets I defy you to dislike this one. Basically the same plot regurgitated (this time New York	 not LA) it features a lot of fun cameos and muppet hi-jinx. A lot of the muppets leave the film pretty early on as it centers around Kermy and Miss Piggy. I happened to have enjoyed it greatly. Fun to watch with your kids."	1.0
"This movie starts out with a certain amount of promise; but	 in my view	 begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down. That this well-meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough	 but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family's life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories.<br /><br />I found this movie average at best. Art direction could have been much better	 as could have been cinematography. The acting was good	 and so was Eva van der Gucht's singing."	0.0
"I gave this more than a 1 because I did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and I. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre and I must confess I came out feeling like I had been beaten over the head with the God this 	 God that and Christ is our saviour stuff. The movie and the story line did not need it. If 	 as I am 	 you are a recovering Catholic or Christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous. The movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been."	0.0
"What boob at MGM thought it would be a good idea to place the studly Clark Gable in the role of a Salvation Army worker?? Ironically enough	 another handsome future star	 Cary Grant	 also played a Salvation Army guy just two years later in the highly overrated SHE DONE HIM WRONG. I guess in hindsight it's pretty easy to see the folly of these roles	 but I still wonder WHO thought that Salvation Army guys are ""HOT"" and who could look at these dashing men and see them as realistic representations of the parts they played. A long time ago	 I used to work for a sister organization of the Salvation Army (the Volunteers of America) and I NEVER saw any studly guys working there (and that includes me	 unfortunately). Maybe I should have gotten a job with the Salvation Army instead!<br /><br />So	 for the extremely curious	 this is a good film to look out for	 but for everyone else	 it's poor writing	 sloppy dialog and annoying moralizing make for a very slow film."	0.0
"How can Barry Levinson possibly assemble white-hot comedy talents Ben Stiller and Jack Black	 the gorgeous Rachel Weisz	 old pro Christopher Walken and still deliver such a humourless stinker?<br /><br />Stiller and Black are friends until the latter invents a spray to make dog mess vanish and becomes a conspicuous consuming multi-millionaire.<br /><br />The premises is thin but sound enough in the right hands to have been a springboard for some great bitching between the two stars but all concerned overplay every hand	 every chance they can.<br /><br />Stiller and Black are simply not funny for way too much of the time	 Weisz looks sensational as always but is criminally underused and	 with the exception of Walken as a batty barfly who urges Stiller's character to take revenge	 it's a turgid trudge to the end of this strained farce."	0.0
"I've tried to watch this show several times	 but for a show called ""That '70s Show	"" I don't find much apart from a few haircuts and the occasional reference to disco that actually evokes the '70s -- the decade in which I grew up. Of the episodes I have seen	 most of the plots and jokes could be set in any time period. Take away the novelty of (supposedly) being set in the '70s	 and the show is neither interesting nor funny.<br /><br />If you're looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of youth in America in the '70s	 in my humble opinion you can do no better than ""The Wonder Years."""	0.0
"I have no idea how IMDb sorts reviews but I do know that	 as happens often on Amazon.com	 there are a striking number of very negative reviews for this movie which repeat the same	 somewhat obscure talking points	 almost verbatim. A campaign? Only IMDb knows.<br /><br />As for this movie: it's fine. It's a funny	 cute and very straightforward movie.<br /><br />It's been over a decade since I worked in Brooklyn	 lived in Queens and visited relatives in the South Bronx. But I found nothing inauthentic or exploitative about these kids. Is the grandmother a bizarre character? Yup. Do the dialogue and plot acknowledge this? Yes	 thankfully	 they do. Are other movies set in the LES and featuring Dominican / Puerto Rican kids possible? You betcha. Does that make this movie a crime  as some of the (to my eyes	 astroturf) comments would suggest? Hardly. Let a thousand plastic flowers bloom.<br /><br />This is better than any episode of Degrassi JR. High or Degrassi High. Scoff at the comparison but _we've never had that_ and I'm touched	 to the core	 by this movie's humility of purpose and tender spirit.<br /><br />That said	 I'd love to know the backstory behind all this backbiting! :-D"	1.0
"In the immortal ""Shaun of the Dead""	 we are introduced to a London where the slackers and the high-and-mighty alike are forced to battle flesh-eating	 reanimated corpse versions of their friends and family. At the end of the film	 it is suggested that the zombies are rendered harmless and used as cheap labour. ""Fido"" presents us with an epilogue to ""Shaun"" set in 1950's America	 in a hilariously witty and original ""what-if...?"" movie.<br /><br />The film is set post-zombie-apocalypse	 for a change; after the terrors of the Zombie Wars	 ended by the creation of the ZomCon company and their patented zombie collars which make the corpses as docile as lambs. Every town in the world is fenced off from the Wild Zone	 the once-fertile landscape torn asunder by the surviving zombies and left-overs from the apocalyptic wars. The idyllic town of Willard is your typical	 pristine 50's suburbia	 with one small difference; social status is measured by a family's amount of domesticated zombies. Unfortunately	 the Robinson family has no zombies whatsoever	 due to their patriarch	 Bill's	 fear of the reanimated dead. Timmy Robinson and his mother Helen both suffer from the pressures of suburban life	 until the day that Helen purchases a zombie servant in a desperate attempt to impress the neighbours.<br /><br />The zombie earns Timmy's love when he rescues him from a pair of violent bullies	 and the two form a bond to rival the classic ""boy-and-his-dog"" cliché... a boy and his zombie. Timmy names his ""pet"" Fido	 and he soon becomes an aid for both Timmy and Helen to escape the prison-like routine Bill has put them in. But when Fido's domestication collar goes on the fritz and he devours the elderly Mrs Henderson	 the Robinsons have to contain their connection the sudden wild zombie epidemic and still manage to keep their beloved Fido.<br /><br />A film whose sharp wit and satirical gore carry it just as much as its all-star cast (including ""The Matrix""'s Carrie-Anne Moss as Helen Robinson and Billy Connelly as Fido)	 ""Fido"" is a zom-com for the ages. With some rather twisted subplots - for example	 the sweet and unsettling feelings that Helen and Fido begin to have for each other - and a poignant commentary on 50's suburbia and the zombie genre	 the film manages to bring out the worst (and the best) in its characters while still enabling you to care for them.<br /><br />""Fido"" is	 by far	 one of the best dark comedies I've ever seen	 one of the best films that I've seen in a long time	 and THE best zom-com since the incredible ""Shaun of the Dead""."	1.0
"Coming shortly before the imposition of a morality code darkened the spirits of writers	 directors and actors	 the first film adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's ""Of Human Bondage"" titillated countless moviegoers. It has no shock value today	 just fine acting.<br /><br />While the cast is excellent	 this is Bette Davis's first great role and one of Leslie Howard's best performances. Howard is English wannabe Parisian artist Philip Carey who is gently and firmly told that he lacks any talent and that his dedication is no substitute for true genius. Taking the lesson to heart he returns to London and enrolls in a medical college (one	 by the way	 that seems to have no female students-at that time there would have been at least a few. Perhaps author/physician Maugham didn't care for distaff medicos).<br /><br />Having tea one day Carey is entranced by a waitress	 Mildred Rogers	 Bette Davis in a role as a morally loose and basically wicked farrago. Her Cockney accent is as sharp as Eliza Doolittle's. His repeated attempts to date her are greeted with the less than enthusiastic reply	 ""I don't mind	"" a sure sign for any man with his head screwed on straight that he's plumbing the depths. Maugham's Mildred supplemented her waitress tips with a bit of old fashioned street-walking	 something not clearly brought out here.<br /><br />Carey's besotted prostration serves Rogers' avaricious need for support of the financial kind. He is desperately in love with her-she plays him as a Sunday church organist effortlessly plies her instrument. No sex here. Recognizing that he is getting nowhere	 he begins a chaste relationship with Norah	 a woman who adores him. Re-enter Mildred	 replete with a baby	 and in her usual need of being taken care of. Exit heartbroken Norah. <br /><br />Another separation from Mildred and Carey begins a long-term friendship with Sally	 abetted enthusiastically by her dad who seems to view eventual marriage as both a good thing for the two young people and a chance to be relieved of one of his nine offspring.<br /><br />The movie reasonably but not entirely follows Maugham's excellent novel. Howard's Carey is naive and vulnerable and for much of the movie his sad eyes remind one of a doe facing a double-barreled shotgun. Mildred is unrestrainedly wicked	 a user of the worst kind	 her sole preoccupation with her own needs barely disguised when she tries to wheedle Carey with a thin patina of affectionate words (and offers-at one point she promises she'll do ""anything [he] wants	"" a daring statement for the times and one I'm sure audiences fully understood.<br /><br />Pre-Code it may be but Mildred's quick-march dissolution would have satisfied the League of Catholic Decency. The ending is conventional-sin loses	 principled behavior triumphs.<br /><br />Director John Cromwell wrought excellent performances from his two main stars	 one well-established	 the other established largely because of this film. The atmosphere is 1930s London and the trip back in time is worth taking.<br /><br />Available on DVD.<br /><br />9/10 (for Davis's and Howard's performances)"	1.0
"I only watched this movie because I was so impressed with Olivier Martinez in SWAT. But this is no SWAT. SWAT had a plot and some likable characters and made sense. Bullfighter had none of these. <br /><br />I should have realized that it couldn't possibly be any good	 after all	 the always painfully bad Michelle Forbes had a starring role.<br /><br />One poster here called the movie incoherent. Another called it the worst movie ever. Both gave the movie far too much credit. I am so glad I got it from the library for free	 yet I still feel ripped off.<br /><br />IMDb needs to include a ""0"" in the ""rate this film"" vote	 just for movies like this one."	0.0
"For such a great classic tale	 the setting (location)	 Grendel was disappointing. As a writer	 I blame the script which completely lacked dramatic tension. The rubric of the club story is useful and would have provided a new take on the literary classic. For some weird reason that rubric was dropped early on. To know this was shot in 21 days says to me	 ""rushed"" and it unfortunately shows. Now we'll have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I word on FX	 I can tolerate really crappy CGI but the script has to rock and this one was just too slow	 spartan and lacking in drama. I'd blame it on the actors but... since I know writing more than acting	 I'll pick on my colleague."	0.0
"A slick romanticizing of the sexual exploitation of NewOrleans black women by white men of power and privilege. Ooh. Does that whet your appetite? Well	 then	 belly up to a VHS or DVD and gorge on this gratuitous trolling through a seamy segment of history. For good measure	 it's adapted from the book by celebrated hack Anne Rice. The directing is as cloying and melodramatic as the cheesy dialog. Most of acting is amateurish. The production's sole worthwhile note is that it employed practically a dozen black actors	 all of whom have scarcely been in employed in today's market (Jasmine Guy	 Ben Vereen	 Pam Grier	 Eartha Kitt)	 including some faces that have barely been seen at all (Bianca Lawson	 Rachel Cuttrell). It also is	 despite itself	 a sterling showcase for Nicole Lyn. The pompous and ponderous James Earl Jones is on-hand as well. So	 is the late Ossie Davis	 a minimal talent who owes his success to having been affiliated with the legendary Negro Ensemble Company. This film should be rated ""T"" for tripe."	0.0

Poor acting	 stupid direction	 weak storyline and pathetic action sequences - and when you blend this together you get ""Double Impact"".

"Prior to watching ""Dahmer	"" I thought no movie could be worse than ""Freddy Got Fingered."" I was wrong. To sum ""Dahmer"" up	 it's a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of Dahmer's encounters with gay men before they were killed. There is no plot to be found	 and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about ""Dahmer."" All you'll learn about Dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men. Horrible acting	 horrible directing	 horrible writing	 horrible everything... If you have to choose between watching ""Dahmer"" and projectile vomiting for three hours	 go with the vomiting .... it wll be less painful....."	0.0
"I caught this movie late at night on cable	 and I was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine the reason this movie was not better known	 is because the subject matter is very disturbing. But if you can handle the sexual abuse topic	 it is a well acted	 suspenseful and very interesting movie. Both Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good in it. And although the subject matter is not for the faint of heart	 the movie doesn't go out of its way to be brutal either (like 8mm for instance).<br /><br />I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys serial killer and suspense type movies."	1.0
"After a love triangle story in Har Dil Jo Pyaar Karega these 3 stars were again chosen in this controversial flick. The film would have been considered as hit if there was not a controversy with the production values from Bharat Shah. Here director duo Abbas-Mustan did a very different and unique job as compared with their previous and after directorial ventures. They are considered as thriller makers of Bollywood. But in this CCCC they proved that they can equally handle to make a romantic family drama. Hardly there is a single action scene when Preity was being raped by Salman's colleague in her apartment	 Salman slapped him.<br /><br />The movie has almost all the standards and ingredients like song	 story	 casting	 performances etc. which are required to make a movie hit. But of course for Salman's fan this was something a surprise gift from him. Why? Because for so long he has been doing roles where he has a scene to show his open body and dance la-la-la all around. His role as a rich young businessman who has no-nonsense nature and of normal attitude is really impressive. After all Madhubala	 a prostitute role performed by Preity is amazing. Later when she too turns out thoughtful about her life she deserve proper attention. Her facial expressions and body language become more attractive	 and focus mainly goes to her. Her previous role as a pregnant woman in Kya Kehna was not that heart-touching as it is here. Of course	 this can be termed as improvement. Then Priya	 a very innocent and helpless wife of Raj who only depends on him for a better result. She has nothing powerful influence in the story as the main ingredients are in the hands of Preity.<br /><br />Finally	 the main point of the story which is something rare and unique in itself. In real world of this age it is not totally impossible to happen such step of searching for a surrogate mother. Perhaps	 many are happening in this large world where these are kept secret. And in this way the scriptwriter of CCCC has uncovered a hidden truth which is taking place in others daily lives. But still then it is a doubt."	1.0
"I don't understand why making remakes has become the trend. Every remake I have ever seen is awful	 and this is no exception. If any of you have seen the quote from Ben Jones	 that it is a ""sleazy"" piece of trash	 he is quite right. Why they would take a wonderful television show	 which I loved	 have never missed an episode	 and own seasons 1-4 on DVD	 and ruin it	 I'll never know. The television show was a family show	 and although Daisy has the body	 it was really flaunted	 or even addressed in the show	 save the outfits. A family show has been turned in to a dirty piece of garbage	 and I wouldn't recommend anyone go see it. Another thing I didn't like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are excellent actors (along with the rest of the original cast)	 and they are also extremely cute. The new Bo and Luke are not even a little cute. That was one of the drawers for the show. The casting is terrible. They could have at least gotten a brunette for Daisy. I don't think Burt Reynolds is a qualified Boss Hogg	 either. Every other role he has ever played is totally opposite this role. The only role they cast halfway decent is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse	 but still it is no comparison. Denver Pyle is an actor all his own	 and that made him perfect for the role. I think that the casting is awful	 the story is awful	 and all in all ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty	 terrible movie. I wouldn't recommend anyone go see it. I only saw it out of curiosity	 plus there was a free ticket in season 4 DVD. I would never have paid to see this movie	 but it was free. DON'T PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE."	0.0
"SLIGHT SPOILERS (but it doesn't matter anyway).<br /><br />An exercise in gobblygook of catastrophic proportions not even worthy of the l0 lines I need to put these remarks on the netwaves. This is the single worst episode of the Masters series to date and the first that qualifies for the defunct Mystery Science Theatre treatment. Even if it took me a full half hour to realize the intended ironic angle	 it was still a very lame mess. Its sole value lies in the perspective that forces one to realize that in addition to gore and ugly masks the genre only succeeds when the classic cinematic notions of photography and lighting	 dialogue and acting	 editing and timing are put to use. Here they are absent and John Carpenter is no master. Period. And no trite analysis of the easy social comment herein will change that. Oddly	 Carpenter never has been anything more than a B director	 but at least such films as 'Fog' and 'The Thing' had terrific atmosphere (the latter is one of my cult favorites).<br /><br />Abominable acting. Camera angles stuck in cement. Tensionless rhythm. Yet perhaps the single most obnoxious element of the episode is the storyline which of course JC cannot really be blamed for (unless the writers were buddies of Cody.) The initial two minute slo-mo of a girl running through a forest only to be nearly run over by a would be Scully-Mulder duo is the first and last thing that works in the film. But come on	 a girl hurtling through a deserted woods to nowhere in particular in desperate need of an abortion fortuitously rendez-vous with the fender of a pair of 'women's rights' MDs whose clinic just happens to be at the end of the road around the corner. Oh	 and I won't even nitpick about how the doc whips the accidentee into the car and speeds away at 0 to 60 in six seconds. Does wonders for possible broken ribs or concussion.<br /><br />Then things fall apart real quick. The vacuous dialogue ""I just want to help you""	 the interminably sluggish back and forth at the gate	 grandiose battle tactics like cutting the telephone line (in the age of cell phones?) followed by the the shoot-out: a born-again Ramboesque clinic director vs Ron Perlman and the high school bullpen out for a few kicks at Easter break. Another lovely line: ""So what are we going to do?"" from the kid who had just been sitting on a pile of assault rifles in the back of the van. Er	 no it isn't yet pheasant season. So who needs those teen boys anyway. What about the good old tried and true method of the lone lunatic who bashes his way through the gate with his all-American SUV?<br /><br />As for the exchange of bullets scenes themselves	 the cuts here were as stiff as the staccato of a DC comics strip. All that was lacking were the Wham	 Bam	 and Whiz of the balloon titles. And all to the tune of a soundtrack worthy of an old Mannix episode.<br /><br />At one point we learn that Daddy isn't really the daddy	 but at this point we haven't been led to care much any more either. This story's single source of drama is the conflict between the pro-life father and his pregnant daughter who is only thankful she's not having twins. Yet there is not a single scene	 flashback or not	 where they are actually ever found together. They remain mere abstractions to each other throughout.<br /><br />With the exception of the gatekeeper every single one of the characters is absolutely dislikeable. Bland	 hysterical	 dull-headed	 macho. As perfectly flat as human wallpaper can be. None of the doctors seem to have anything medical about them. And there's that bickering Dad who rails at his pregnant daughter as though he himself were the stressed out boyfriend. He fortunately got his. There are two great MST-worthy comic moments: the gusher when Angelica's plumbing goes out and later the new-born lobster with a glued on baby's head. Also cute was Angelica's rugby ball belly before she finally popped the right-to-life little monster from Hell. As for that audacious male abortion scene...well	 they should have retained Miike's episode and banned this one instead.<br /><br />In short	 a 3rd rate Rosemary's Baby meets Alien set on the turf of a M.A.S.H. episode. This stinker alone	 appreciable only to today's permissive under-16 generation	 will assure as someone else said here	 that this series will not be renewed for a third season. A real shame	 since there have been a number of brilliant productions	 including such really decent spoofs as Dante's 'Homecoming' or McKee's deliciously quirky 'Sick Girl'. Not to mention the superb imagery of Malone's 'Fairhaired Child'.<br /><br />Sorry John Carpenter	 I believe your directing days are over. It's time to run for President."	0.0
"This movie looked good - good cast	 evergreen topic and an explosive opening. It went downhill from there. Why was it filmed by hand held camera? It shakes	 judders	 part captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer. A poor choice indeed. As if this was not enough	 the worst edit in memory assumes a drugged viewer - mandatory if you want to get any enjoyment from it at all. And then it commits the worst sin of all. After leading the viewer down all sorts of unlikely and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion	 they roll credits without revealing the denouement - the ending - the payoff -like what the heck was the motive? How can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending? Doh! This movie had great promise and ending up doing a face plant in the mud. What a waste of effort. Poor effort by writer and director."	0.0
"Beautiful film	 pure Cassavetes style. Gena Rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress	 dealing with success	 aging	 loneliness...and alcoholism. She tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts	 embodied by the death spectre of a young girl. Acceptance of oneself	 of human condition	 though its overall difficulties	 is the real purpose of the film. The parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling: it's like if the stage became a way out for the Heroin. If all american movies could only be that top-quality	 dealing with human relations on an adult level	 not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings... One of the best dramas ever. 10/10."	1.0
"Saw this a couple times on the Sundance Channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system. A semi-surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture (or the lack of it)	 focusing on some seriously wacked	 way-beyond-the-Hollywood-fringe dwellers. It had an amusing early performance from Mark Ruffalo	 and some memorable cinematography from the DP who did the Polish Brothers movies. There was a savage umcompromising humor and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart. This film had cult classic written all over it	 and I'm surprised it's not yet out on DVD. <br /><br />Hopefully soon."	1.0
"When a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible	 the cause can invariably be found in the book: either it was pointless to start with	 or the point is one not easily conveyed to film	 or the movie missed the point	 which is the most frequent of these results	 and the easiest to happen	 especially when the point is one not easily defined. The book ""Morvern Callar"" has a point; every reader of the book must have felt this	 and felt as if he had gotten it; but I suspect most of them could not state it in words. I'm not sure I can	 myself	 but perhaps it comes to this	 or something like it: Things come	 things go	 such is life	 but we carry on; or at any rate some of us--people like Morvern--do. No doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition. But the important fact is that there is a point--possibly the sum of the entire story is the point--and that this would have been the main thing to keep in view	 and to carry over	 in adapting the story to film. The maker of this film evidently missed the point	 and doesn't substitute one of her own; and so the film is about nothing.<br /><br />This is not the usual complaint of a book-lover that his favorite text has been violated. The merit of the book is something I conceded grudgingly: in reading it I found it a bloody nuisance	 and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly. The narrative is supposed to be the work of the half-educated Morvern	 but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect	 as if the author were poking at her with his pen; there are inconsistencies of style and tone	 as if different sections had been composed at different times; and any conclusions I could reach about Morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not: for instance	 despite Morvern's own self-characterization as a raver	 am I wrong that in the end she remains essentially a working-class Scots girl	 and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past? In any case	 despite my irritation at the author	 I couldn't deny that his book stuck with me; and what I couldn't get out of my head was his character's attitude	 her angle on the world	 which was almost as vivid as a Goya portrait. Morvern is the kind of person who's always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible; occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her	 like flies	 so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful slogging-through	 unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophical--and that doesn't begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough. The complex of incidents and of Morvern's responses to them are the substance of the book	 and its achievement	 in exposing a cross-section of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise; for all my dislike of the book	 I can see this.<br /><br />The Morvern just described is not the Morvern of the movie; or if it is	 most of her is kept offscreen. An actress who might have been a good fit for the character	 had she been the right age at the right time	 is Angharad Rees	 from the old TV series ""Poldark"". Samantha Morton	 then	 would seem like good casting: she's rather the same sort of actress	 and in one of her earlier movies	 ""Jesus' Son""	 she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one. Unfortunately	 as the film turned out	 she doesn't have the character from the book to play. For one thing	 the book is one that	 if it is to be dramatized	 virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience; without her comments	 her perspective	 her voice	 the story loses most of its meaning. It has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements: the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty	 and so Morvern's responses (whether of amusement or distaste	 depending on her mood) are missing too	 and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story. In short	 the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk	 edgy serio-comic novel into a genteel art TV film	 and chose as her typical image one of Ms. Morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy; as if the outing Morvern signs up for were a tour of the Stations of the Cross. This isn't at all what the book	 or the Morvern of the book	 was about. For another thing	 the Morvern of the movie isn't Scottish (the actress said in an interview she hadn't had time to study up the accent)	 and she ought to be: it's important that she	 her family	 and her mates are all from a single place. And finally the film is missing the end of the story: Morvern's spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness: it's winter	 the dam has frozen	 the power has gone out	 and the pub is dark. Minus this	 and minus all of the rest	 what's left is a failed art film	 a dead film	 about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal	 or native inability	 ever to give in to being dead."	0.0
"I gave this movie a 5 out of pure pity. My intention is not to burst anyone's bubble	 because I've seen	 as I've skimmed through other comments	 that this movie is quite appreciated by many. Well	 it is not worth any praises	 and I say this because I've seen the original anime	 Basilisk	 and this movie shames it deeply. Perhaps if you see Shinobi alone	 you could like it. It is enjoyable due to the well-choreographed battles	 based on fantasy more than on martial arts	 and I agree that their beauty is deeply enhanced. But the story is nothing like the original one. Now	 I understand that when one transforms an anime/manga into a movie	 one must make certain changes. I was not expecting to see the freakish characters from the anime	 although they have a well-established role	 and some are truly profound and well-designed. But I certainly did not expect to see immense and wrongly-placed changes	 that basically ruin the entire story. Characters who are dramatically and unethically mutilated	 transformed in something the public might love more	 perhaps. For instance	 Oboro	 who	 in the anime is a sweet	 innocent girl	 completely and utterly in love with Gennosuke	 becomes a vengeful clan leader in the movie. I liked the fact that the woman becomes strong and evades the limitations imposed on her by the era (we are talking about Japan	 17th century)	 but her mood changes are unbelievable and badly written. Hotarubi	 which is one of my favourite characters in the film	 but who is not known for her childish and sensitive nature	 becomes a pathetic little girl who is not only not madly in love like in the anime	 but is more or less worthless in the plot. I could go on and on	 like how they made Tenzen	 the worst and most dangerous character in the anime	 exceptionally weak and unattractive	 or how Gennosuke	 the leading character seems completely misplaced and confused	 not to mention	 again WEAK. The music is beautiful and the image is astounding	 which was expected of a Japanese movie	 and I appreciate it for that. But do not watch this if you've seen and enjoyed Basilisk	 because it is just hopeless. Basilisk	 although based on fantasy	 with elements of horror and largely exaggerated is splendid and has so much more depth in its characters	 storyline	 historical value and it is	 may I say	 heartbreaking. Shinobi was a waste of time and I could not believe it kept on going after what was supposed to be the climax. Alas	 it pains me deeply to judge a movie so harshly	 but I advise you against it. Please	 watch the anime	 or at least watch the movie first and then repair your image of what Basilisk really is by watching the anime. Otherwise you will have a seizure when you realize how they've massacred it."	0.0
"This movie bewilders me. It may be that I'm just a stupid American	 but I really just don't get 400 Blows. Everything I've read about this movie has been a total rave	 but I just couldn't stay interested. I'm sure that it was as revolutionary in film-making as all the critics say	 but when it boils right down to it	 it's just really really boring. Maybe it's the language barrier	 may I'm just not ""sensitive"" or ""artsy"" enough	 but whatever the case is	 I hated this movie. The story itself isn't bad; it's about a young French boy who is treated unfairly by his parents and his teachers	 and eventually he ends up in a juvenile facility. That in itself ought to be interesting	 and it was	 at first. There was nothing wrong with the dialogue	 but then again it's hard to say because half of the conversations weren't subtitled and for no apparent reason	 so I didn't always know what was going on. But for the dialogue we could understand	 it made enough sense. The actors were believable enough	 but it's hard to say what a real person would do in these situations. So you feel for the main character	 but only in the sense that when he gets into trouble you think	 well that sucks. The plot isn't even your typical plot. Each time he gets in trouble	 he gets into more trouble than the last time	 but the reasons never vary too much. And through the entire film you realize that there's nothing the main character can really do about it. So it's more like just waiting to see how it ends. The ending	 by the way	 was completely over my head. It's way too artsy for me	 and I just didn't get it. Leading up to the end was easy enough to follow. The structure was certainly there	 and it made sense as well	 but everything was really drawn out. For the amount of dialogue and significant moments	 the movie could have been an hour shorter. It just didn't end. Part of it was the unnecessarily long shots	 none of which were especially memorable; for example	 the ending was a clip of the main character running down a country road that lasted a good thirty seconds. Now	 I'm sure that had some deeper meaning in it somewhere	 but for the average viewer	 I'd rather have gotten up to get some more food during that time. Or at least done something a little more useful than sit and watch this boy running	 like doing my laundry	 or taking a nap. <br /><br />Final Verdict <br /><br />The feeling throughout the whole movie was that this probably would be very moving and just amazing and that it would teach me some great life lesson	 if I could only get what the director was trying to say by his unique decisions. As it was	 I just felt cheated out of a good two hours of my life."	0.0
"""John Hughes' son wrote a high school drama! Wow!"" I thought as I checked the flick's info here on IMDb	 late on a Saturday night	 having found myself watching the opening credits on BBC2.<br /><br />I've just finished watching it	 and sadly it was downhill from there on. Arguably you can't spoil a film this poor	 but I'll leave the spoilers out of this review... <br /><br />There's an awful lot of style over very little substance: unfortunately the style hasn't dated too well in the eight years since its release. As for the substance	 the film tries to pose an interesting look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of school-life; but beneath the shiny veneer	 a remotely meaningful or relevant argument fails to materialise. Characters are painted in childishly broad strokes	 falling into the kind of generic stereotypes the writer's father sought to question in Breakfast Club. <br /><br />Director Kyle Cooper does a decent job keeping the pace up (perhaps relying a little too much on montages of information	 which soon becomes a tiresome device	 but at least pushes the story along)	 but his efforts don't sufficiently detract from the poor script and bizarre casting (how anyone is supposed to side with 'Maddox'	 when Blake Shields gurns and glowers his way through the part	 I just can't understand)	 not to mention the numerous gaping plot holes (I'm all for creative license	 but when the ""bad guys"" know the identities of the ""good guys"" making their lives a misery	 but fail to act in any way to stop them	 you really have to wonder why this script didn't undergo another few re-drafts before production - did Daddy even read it?).<br /><br />I'm sure a younger audience might get some enjoyment from this film (and all power to them)	 but they're really better off sticking with Hughes Sr.'s high school output	 and if the idea of school-time rebellion is what really appeals	 the 1968 classic ""If..."" is a much more satisfying examination of the subject."	0.0
"After	 I watched the films... I thought	 ""Why the heck was this film such a high success in the Korean Box Office?"" Even thought the movie had a clever/unusal scenario	 the acting wasn't that good and the characters weren't very interesting. For a Korean movie... I liked the fighting scenes. If you want to watch a film without thinking	 this is the film for you. But I got to admit... the film was kind of childish... 6/10"	1.0
"Difficult film to comment on	 how do you say it's bad? Well it isn't	 but then it's equally difficult to say it is good. What it is	 is compelling viewing	 it is as close as you will get to utter devastation without being there. It is the photographs of the tsunami approaching the coast of Thailand brought to life	 you know you want to turn away but you have to watch.<br /><br />The Naudet brothers handle the commentary very well	 even in the most tragic of circumstances	 there view on something which is happening in another country neither panders nor insults. The facts are on the cellulose and little is needed for the viewer to understand or comprehend what is going on.<br /><br />You can't change history	 and you should not want	 this film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour."	1.0
"Now this is what a family movie should be! There are few films of recent years that have been targeted at families or children that really are worthy of their viewing public; but this IS one of them. My whole family came away from the film	 awed	 entertained	 dazzled	 and happy. We're still quoting little anecdotes from it here and there. The children LOVED it and so did we (hubbie and I are 36 and 32	 respectively)!<br /><br />Apart from its beautiful and striking animation	 the characters (small as they may be	 and imaginary as they are) are very well developed. There isn't one of them that you cannot empathize with. The personalities bringing these little creatures to life are well casted voice talents	 combined with the skill and artistry of some of Disney's best animators. This is a film worthy of Walt Disney	 himself. I think Mr. Disney would heartily approve of this new film... Flick	 Dot and their fellow band of tiny heroes may become as popular as Mickey and Minnie in our time.<br /><br />This is one the family leaves the theatre wanting to see again.. and buy to own on video or DVD. I'm eager to see it again.. to pick up what I might have missed the first time. (Never have I seen my children so quickly and vividly identify with and embrace characters before... my daughter is still talking about little ""Dot"".)<br /><br />This film is funny	 heartwarming	 clever and great fun for the whole family!"	1.0
"""This Is Not A Love Song"" is a brilliant example of the chase genre	 which many people think has an underlying meaning. The love between the two main characters may be more than fraternal. I believe that Heaton is in love with Spike	 but Spike is too naive to see this.<br /><br />I really feel this is portrayed with such scenes as the blow back and letter writing sequences. Heaton shows great intimacy towards Spike. With intense facial expressions and how he takes great care in writing Spike's name on the top of his letters.<br /><br />One thing I've noticed when looking at external reviews	 is that when the film has been slated	 the reviewer seems to have not fully understood the film	 as they haven't even mentioned the possibility of Heaton having sexual feelings for Spike. I also get the feeling that some of the reviewers haven't recognised it	 when they use phrases like: ""Who is Heaton? What's he doing with a retard like Spike?"" This person	 however may have hit the nail on the head with their remark. Spike shows noticeable signs of having A.D.D	 although I don't think this person has realised this	 as he seems to be using the word ""retard"" as a derogatory term.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film. Although it is not for the faint hearted. The film is exceedingly character based	 after the shooting until the end there isn't much but dialogue between the two anti-heroes. Unless you are used to watching such deep	 gritty films	 stay well away."	1.0
"In Lizzie Borden's ""Love Crimes"" (1992)	 Sean Young plays a gritty D.A. in Atlanta. She's a loner who gets herself too deeply involved in the case of a man (Patrick Bergin) who poses as a famous fashion photographer and seduces women	 takes compromising photos of them	 then leaves them.<br /><br />Naturally	 this tough loner decides to enter the phony shutterbug's life by posing as his prey	 intending to bring him to justice. They meet	 they make love	 then the next thing she knows	 she is over his lap	 getting spanked. (Note: The spanking scene is only in the ""unrated"" version of this film. The R-rated version omits it and several other scenes that would make the plot more lucid.) This psychological thriller includes several scenes of female nudity and disturbing images	 such as Bergin chasing one of his victims around the room	 flailing at her with a riding crop.<br /><br />As a thriller	 ""Love Crimes"" is at its best when Sean Young is playing her cat-and-mouse game with Bergin	 trying to catch him in an incriminating act. It's unfortunate that the film doesn't end	 it just stops. That's true. Director Lizzie Borden may have just run out of story to tell	 but after 92 minutes the credits roll	 and we are left with a puzzling ""what just happened?"" bewilderment.<br /><br />The unfolding of Young's plan is played out in engaging style	 but the lack of a coherent ending will be a turn-off for some viewers.<br /><br />Dan (daneldorado@yahoo.com)"	1.0
"Been lurking for a couple of years or so. I have never been moved to post on here before	 so perhaps this movie is worth a star for that	 but I doubt it. I just watched it on DVD	 having missed it in the movies due to illness and never got around to watching it till now. I had not read extensively about it	 certainly not even thought about the movie in some months. It was just what the buddy picked up in the store	 so it got watched.<br /><br />Bad mistake.<br /><br />The shot I spoke of in the the summary up top is in the trailer and on the poster. Right from the off	 Jason Statham has hair. Like in no other GR movie. Or any JS movie that I've seen. At least not in the quantities on display here. And Ray Liotta in underpants SHOULD be advance warned. It's scary and funny but not in a ha-ha-humour way. Its more in an almost-TheOffice-but-slightly-mutated-and-so-failing-sort-of-humour way. They each say the same thing: ""This movie is not like anything you expect this movie to be.""<br /><br />Now	 based on previous	 extensive	 movie-watching experience	 I expected this movie to be a few things. Like:<br /><br />() Coherent	<br /><br />() Interesting or engaging	<br /><br />() Not a complete and utter farrago of navel-gazing	<br /><br />() Something more substantive than a motley bunch of badly-realised fables from what is just a standard eastern mystic ideology dressed up as a ""cool	 modern	 self-aware art-form""	<br /><br />() Hopefully better than ""The Idiots"".<br /><br />As you may have guessed by my tone	 it thoroughly failed to check any box above. Instead it was:<br /><br />(x) Badly edited {pace all over the shop	 70s-amateur high-8 style jump cuts	 incomprehensible ""plot"" ""twists!!!"" delivered through hackneyed flash-back montages	 I could go on...}	<br /><br />(x) Shot as if by a depressed 14yr-old goth who'd just spent the weekend watching Truffaut and Godard with the drapes drawn<br /><br />(x) So up its own behind with the whole ""I'm really smart	 me"" motif/ message	 that it feels determined to repeat it every 20 minutes or so	 just to make sure the dumb people (ie: everyone who doesn't like it) in the audience make sure they get the point	<br /><br />(x) A genuine waste of my time.<br /><br />As for the undoubted ability of some people to ""get"" something from this	 fine. I'm glad you enjoyed it. One poster said something that caught my attention: under-25s probably understood it better because of the editing. Maybe	 but editing is supposed to make your work more accessible	 not less. As for the ""Genius is only recognised by the enlightened"" brigade out there	 go suck an onion and grow up. There is nothing more presumptuous and self-serving than people who say the reason another person doesn't know great art is because they don't understand the 'craft /materials /moon cycle /filaments of supreme rational thought' which the 'auteur /poet/ artist/ palm reader/ idiot savant' is using to explain his or her 'vision /grand scheme /oneness with Gaea /great big bucket of dog-sick'.<br /><br />For me and many	 many more people	 its garbage. <br /><br />Movies	 art	 stories	 poetry	 anything designed to be viewed by another human is supposed to be engaging and moving. In some direction be it metaphorical	 spiritual	 emotional or whatever you're having yourself.<br /><br />The only way this moved me was forward in time	 two hours closer to my own inevitable demise.

"Sly's best out and out action film. It is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters	 solid performances and Renny Harlins direction is stylishly assured. Stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes. This was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the 90's	 a definite genre classic. As a Stallone fan this is one I look back on with fond memories. Plenty of superb action and Sly in prime action man form. Action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film. The film looks great and there is great support from Janine Turner	 Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****"	1.0
(spoilers?)<br /><br />while the historical accuracy might be questionable... (and with the mass appeal of the inaccurate LOTR.. such things are more easily excused now) I liked the art ness of it.

"Director Otto Preminger reunites with his Laura stars Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney in this rough and ready to rumble film noir: Where The Sidewalk Ends. This film is complete with a well-written crime story with interesting characters	 unexpected turns	 and clever dialogue and an eye-pleasing look with great camera movements and dark and gritty film noir lighting. Dana Andrews stars as Detective Mark Dixon	 part mobster and part cop	 who has a reputation of being too physically tough with criminals. After one case sees Dixon in search of suspects and answers	 he gets far more involved than he wanted. <br /><br />Dana Andrews is terrific in his role - tough and edgy	 Andrews' Dixon is ready to knock any and all off their heels if they get on his bad side. He's the perfect film noir anti-hero - he's not very nice all the time	 but we still root for him. Gene Tierney does a solid job in her role	 as much as it is	 being a sweet shoulder for Dixon. There might not be too much to Tierney's role	 but she certainly goes above and beyond what others could do with the role	 knocking every member of the audience out with her kind smile	 gentle manner	 and twinkle in her eye. The supporting cast isn't too bad either - Karl Malden being the most memorable	 stepping in and giving a good supporting performance as Lieutenant Thomas. Where The Sidewalk Ends is no Laura	 but it is a great film noir filled with great characters	 story	 and picture."	1.0

"My Name is Modesty is a low-budget film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise. It's not that the movie is terrible	 it's just not what I was expecting or hoping for. While I've been aware of the Modesty Blaise character for years	 I'm not overly familiar with the comic strips or the graphic novels	 so I'm coming into this movie as something as an outsider. That may be part of the reason for my disappointment. I was expecting more action and more comedy. The film is dialogue driven. I suppose I was looking for something with a little more camp value. As it is	 My Name is Modesty is a deathly serious film. There are very few	 if any	 ""light"" moments. The acting	 at least from Alexandra Staden	 is acceptable but nothing outstanding. As others have commented	 she does appear a little too frail to be completely believable in the title role. What action scenes there are in My Name is Modesty are one of the films weakest points. I never bought into the notion that this woman could handle a band of trained killers.<br /><br />I really hope Quentin Tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumored a big budget film based on the Modesty Blaise character. I'm convinced the concept has a lot of potential and I would very much look forward to it."	0.0
"The Twilight Zone has achieved a certain mythology about it--much like Star Trek. That's because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner. They are the ones who score each individual show a 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show. Because of this	 a while back I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive. Now	 it's time to do the same for The Twilight Zone.<br /><br />While I have scored many episodes 10	 this one gets a 3 simply because it was bad. The writing was in fact embarrassingly bad. Two people from opposing sides in a great war are seen wandering about through the entire episode. After a while	 it's apparent that they are the only two people left on Earth--as you learn in the really stupid and totally unconvincing conclusion. Usually the twist at the end makes the episode great--this one killed it!"	0.0
"Maaan	 where do i start with this god awful movie. Bad bad bad story telling. I do not know what the director was thinking when he made this movie. Namaste London was quite an enjoyable movie to be honest..even the soundtrack was good. But in this one..oh my good..for a movie which is supposed to be a musical one..the songs are soooo bad. AR Rahman should have been the music director. <br /><br />Given two great actors a much better job should have been done by the director. Even though the first half sucks	 the last 30 mins of the movie are OK. Performances from Salman and Ajay save the movie from being a total disaster.<br /><br />Watch it if you have nothing better to do. The last good movie from Bollywood i watched ( and i do watch a load of them) is Dev D and Wake Up Sid."	0.0
"Kalifornia came out in 1993	 just as 3 of the 4 lead characters were up and coming to the levels of fame they now possess in 2006. This is a nice psycho-thriller that should appeal to all David Duchovny fans because of his dry and intelligent narratives that find their ways into his work	 like with most of his episodes of the X-Files	 Playing God	 and Red Shoe Diaries.<br /><br />People who were put off by the heavy southern accent from Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis' characters obviously have never spent much time in the south. For every ""Brian and Carrie"" in the south	 there is an ""Adele and Early"" and in 2006	 that's the real horror of this flick.<br /><br />Aside from that	 I think the film was written with a cult film intention - like with Carrie's photography	 it's not suitable for mass consumption. But if you have a copy of this in your personal library	 I think it says something positive about your tastes for freaky movies."	1.0
"Watching The Tenants has been a interesting experience for me. It is the first film I have ever seen where I have shuttled at speed through parts of the (non)action - and I can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to Serbo-Croat indie and find them fascinating.<br /><br />The Tenants is frustratingly sluggish and over-orchestrated. One of the main problems of the script is there is little realistic character dialogue	 apart from the set pieces where characters 'collide' in a very structured setting (to make this work	 the film needed to feel more conceptual	 which it didn't). This leads to a lack of realistic character development; everyone seems two-dimensional.<br /><br />The worse for this is the character of Bill Spear	 aka Snoop Dogg. I found his characterization very uncomfortable and very unsympathetic. At one point	 I even stopped the film because I got so annoyed by the character's aggressive	 violent and monotonal delivery	 the lack of any other personality layer apart from that of the reactionary ""on"" switch (which gets really predictable after a while) and I so desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities. However	 one reason for this jar might be the nebulous time scape of the film (supposedly 70s	 it feels and looks more early noughties). If it had been more securely fixed in the 70s	 his character might have seemed more understandable.<br /><br />The lighting of the film was also awkward. All the way through	 the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain gritty	 jazz-infused atmosphere that just did not come off	 largely because the set was too well-lit.<br /><br />The Tenants	 to me	 is an unbelievable film. It doesn't depict real people or propose any interesting ways of thinking about race	 identity or the life of a writer	 be they white or black.<br /><br />Strangely	 I came away with the feeling that this project needed David Lynch; his eerie	 clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable."	0.0
"Alright normally i am not as harsh on sequels especially if the first film is done well and was ultimately a good movie. As for 1999 i feel that one of the top five films was Cruel Intentions. It had everything a great movie should have except for an original story	 being adapted from a novel it was still damn good. On to Cruel Intentions 2 which was supposed to actually just be the opener for a series based on the film called manchester prep. Which must not have happened. Actually after seeing this trifle of a film i can understand. Before the thing started i was like at least the writer and director Roger Kumble did this one also. Well 1 minute into this movie i was disappointed. It starts off with a rehash of the opening of the original with a different twist sebastian instead of putting the shrinks daughter's naked picture on the net he puts the schools principals wife in the school directory naked. This would have been alright if the lady was not like 50. And basically the rest of the movie is a wannabe carbon copy of the original. Which i understand the if there is nothing wrong with it leave it the way it was. But you can not do that with a movie. This actually being a prequel i gave it a chance just to see how they turned out like they did in part 1. But with Sebastian being more or less just a prankster and Kathryn being a herself and turning sebastian into the sexual predator he was in the real story	 this movie had no foundation to it. Whoever did the casting on this thing was way off. They could have at least tried to get people who looked like the original cast but no	 they just hired a bunch of not even really good looking actors. I am using this term although i dont know why. They for sure didnt do any in this movie.<br /><br />All this movie is a bunch of one liners that dont even match the wit that the original had	 well some of them did but that was just because they were from part 1. Another bad point was in part one you could understand the need for them to act out for attention because there was no involvement from teir parents this one had them in it and they were poorly used	 as if to show why the kids are like this. It didnt work though. The best thing though about the original was that the cast had chemistry they took you into this world. The on screen tension that was there made the film what it was. This thing Really ruins the experience of the first one stay way from this."	0.0
"I was waiting to see this movie from a long time. It's promos gave a fair idea about the content and when I finally saw it	 I really find it was quite well made. Most of the conventional romantic movies end with the lovers finally getting married or start of with a happy life after marriage but there is really a great adjustment needed for this transition from an old life to a new relation and life. This is what this movie is all about the period when a newly wed couple Fardeen and Esha get married through an arranged marriage and start off their life with their honeymoon. The acting is really spell binding though I think Esha remained a bit quiet and she could have used some lines for herself. The story was well knitted and dialogs were more or less appropriate. The editing and direction were also good	 Meghna Gulzar really did a good job here. To summarize I would say it is a good drama cum romance	 a true combination of what Bollywood can offer a clean entertainer."	1.0
"An American in Paris is a showcase of Gene Kelly. Watch as Gene sings	 acts and dances his way through Paris in any number of situations. Some purely majestic	 others pure corn. One can imagine just what Kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before ""Singin' In The Rain"". He is definately one of the all time greats. It is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films	 especially in Kelly's characters	 the only main difference being that one is based in Paris	 the other in L.A.<br /><br />Some have said that Leslie Caron's acting was less than pure. Perhaps Cyd Charisse	 who was originally intended for the role could have done better	 however Caron is quite believable in the role and has chemistry with Kelly. Oscar Levant's short role in this film gave it just what it needed	 someone who doesn't look like Gene Kelly. Filling the role as the everyman isn't an easy task	 yet Levant did it with as much class as any other lead.<br /><br />The song and dance routines are all perfection. Even the overlong ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film with it than without. Seeing that there really wasn't much screen time to make such a loving relationship believable	 Minnelli used this sequence to make it seem as if you'd spent four hours with them. Ingenious!<br /><br />I would have to rate this film up with Singin' since it is very similar in story and song. Singin' would barely get the nod because of Debbie Reynolds uplifting performance.<br /><br />Full recommendation.<br /><br />8/10 stars."	1.0
"I disliked this movie for numerous reasons. Within the first ten minutes of the film	 I grew extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie was going to salvage itself	 for me at least	 that it was going to have to pull itself out of the enormous hole it had dug. Unfortunately	 that did not occur. The two draws of the movie for me were to see Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I don't know enough about Lindsey Lohan's work to have been interested in what she would bring to the film. Afterward	 I just felt disappointed in and for all three of them even though there were ""moments"" in each of their performances. I imagine that for each of them to find their ""moments"" was a very difficult task given the fact that there was an amazing lack of character development and uninspired dialog. Although the plot is an interesting one	 the movie on the whole is so poorly written	 directed and edited that anybody's performance as an actor would suffer and be tainted by it. The disrespectful way in which it dealt with sexual abuse and the trite and insulting viewpoint of small-town America	 I think	 were the two main reasons why this film failed in hitting it's mark. As one reviewer has noted and I would agree	 the movie is almost impossible to market given it's finished form. I suspect that	 or at least hope that (for the actor's sakes anyway) there are some real gems on the cutting room floor. Sad for us but if that's true then the actors can take solace in that and feel somewhat good about lending their talents and time to such a flop. Oh yeah and another thing...I wished for just once I could go see an American movie which included the sadly disappearing but wonderfully bucolic settings such as the one in this film where the main characters weren't absentmindedly and/or disrespectfully littering the country side with pop cans	 smashed CDs and	 other such trash!"	0.0
"I somehow missed this movie when it came out and have discovered it as late as last week thanks to a friend's recommendation. I can honestly say that I cannot remember another intimate dramatic film	 which does so many things so well. The writing is crisp	 realistic	 nuanced	 and even restrained. The cinematography and editing are understated but inspired	 enabling the visual storytelling to dominate through marvelous close-ups and framing of images	 capturing loneliness and alienation in most memorable ways. The acting is also wonderful	 with all of the characters becoming painfully real and vulnerable in the most compelling ways that a film can offer. They reveal their innermost weaknesses with unprotected	 raw vulnerability. A real triumph for Roger Michell and Hanif Kureishi	 and the rest of the team. A must see for serious film lovers."	1.0
"This is an excellent show! I had a US history teacher in high school that was much like this. There are many ""facts"" in history that are not quite true and Mr Wuhl points them out very well	 in a way that is unforgettable.<br /><br />Mr Wuhl is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he uncovers some very well known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them upon that brains of his students. Use of live actors performing ""skits"" is also very entertaining. <br /><br />I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down."	1.0
"I happened upon this flick on a rainy Sunday	 intending to tune-in to something else. Out of curiosity	 I accessed the comments here	 and found myself watching it to the end. I really didn't do so with intent -- this was one of those movies where you're ""fascinated	"" and watch it for ""another couple of minutes	"" until you finally just watch to the end. And the indictment of it in most of these comments made it more fascinating to view. The one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking Ladd and Spano	 and their earlier roles. But great isn't anywhere to be found anywhere here - story	 performances	 and particularly the absurd courtroom hi-jinks. We all know that Perry Mason (before Raymond Burr passed the 300-lb. mark)	 and Ben Matlock	 are granted some leeway in cavorting around the courtroom	 instead of being boringly confined to a lectern. And Matlock is especially granted the privilege of entering exhibits often by simply going to the jury and showing them	 before the judge and prosecutor have even been informed of	 or shown	 them. No real-life judge or prosecutor would stand for this.<br /><br />Both Perry and Ben almost always ended the proceedings by wringing a confession of the real killer. Actually Perry nearly always did this	 but often Matlock would simply present overwhelming evidence of the true culprit	 pronounce it ""reasonable doubt	"" and then leave it to the cops and prosecutors to proceed against the guilty party - sometimes on-camera	 sometimes presumed at the end of the show.<br /><br />But that said	 Holland Taylor's histrionics and the amount of leeway afforded her	 in the courtroom portion of this story	 made the actions of Matlock/Mason more-closely resemble the slow	 often boring detail such as seen on Court TV and in real-life courtrooms.<br /><br />Every character in this presentation was either insipid	 unsympathetic	 obnoxious	 boring	 improbable - or some combination of two or more of these.<br /><br />The ending was the most banal	 absurd	 even silly conclusion possible - but again	 fascinating because of this. Ladd and Spano are attractive individuals	 and t.v. movies would appear their best forte - probably best in 2nd-lead (probably better if ""3rd-"") roles	 even in this venue. Taylor could be cast as the aunt or mother of one of them. Give this one 1 star for the story/performances	 and 3 additional for the fascination factor."	0.0
"Wow...<br /><br />I picked this up at the local Wal-Mart after reading online that it had been released early. I've been following this online for some time	 and just had to buy the film.<br /><br />Wow...<br /><br />I guess the thing that really struck me was the editing	 or lack thereof. Time and again	 characters (usually The Narrator and whoever he is with) are shown walking...and walking...and walking. I am not an editor	 but I do know that you can cut between someone leaving point A to show them arriving at point B. There is no need to show almost the entire journey! Wow...<br /><br />I actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this. They seem to have been given no direction as to what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy	 depending on what action was to be added at a later date.<br /><br />Wow...<br /><br />Why it was decided to do almost all the effects using CG is beyond me. Even ILM still employs miniatures sometimes. One of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of (according to the end credits) the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities	 including London. At times these folk are coming and going with no regard as to the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera. In one shot in London	 there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrator's brother (played by star Anthony Piana without his distracting mustache). Not since GETTYSBURG have I seen such a fake piece of facial hair.<br /><br />Wow...<br /><br />Why Timothy Hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me. It is a turkey	 plain and simple. On the plus side (at least for me) it has provided some of the most genuine laugh-out-loud bits of hilarity I have seen in quite a while."	0.0
"Shintarô Katsu	 best known for the Zatôichi films	 again stars in this third and final movie in the Kenji Misumi (mostly known for ""Lone Wolf and Cub)	 directed saga of Hanzo 'The Razor' Itami feature the big dicked one battling ninjas	 rapeing 'ghosts'	 and uncovering shady goings on at the Shogunate treasury. The Hanzo 'plot' was kinda getting stale and repetitive. What was once novel in the first film	 was not any longer. Fortunately	 this one was better then the second thanks to having more humor.

"This movie is horrible	 but you have to see it because of that. I'm not here to discuss the entire film	 just the greatest chase scene ever. When Eddie dumbs milk on Tim	 he gets chased down the hallway. Eddie puts obstacles in the jocks way with hilarious consequences (like a cymbal nailing a trumpet player; buy the DVD and watch it slow). The best obstacle is a knocked over mop bucket which one jock jumps over but proceeds to slide on the ground out a door. But when he slides he picks up speed thus defying physics (mainly friction); yet what lies behind the door is supreme. The steepest stair case in any school ever	 which this jock proceeds to CLEAR in the air. In reality he probably would die of a broken neck. Not only does he defy all concepts of reality	 he makes the funniest noise ever made in that situation. Go and buy this one. Trust me this scene is worth your 6 bucks."	1.0
"Since the day I saw this film when it came out in 1981	 it has been one of my top 3 favorites. The blurb I wrote for Amazon is below	 and I'm just thrilled that it's finally coming out on DVD on 10/17/06 - the film's 25th anniversary.<br /><br />The last credit in this film explains its appeal - ""Thank you to the people of Manhattan on whose island this was filmed."" A charming and witty romantic comedy	 it is a love story written to New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) who can identify every location (West 12th Street	 the Ansonia	 the old FAO Schwartz	 the Plaza	 the Roxy	 Chez Brigitte	 and City Limits which was a country & western club). One gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well off-screen as they do on	 and this intimacy is clearly communicated. I laughed	 I cried	 it was better than CATS. Not only an ode to Dorothy Stratten	 it was also Audrey Hepburn's last feature appearance (she had a cameo subsequent to this film) and her inner beauty seeps from the screen. Buy it	 make a big tub of popcorn	 and curl up with someone you love."	1.0
"I'm sure that the folks on the Texas/Louisiana border must have had a a good laugh or two when Paramount's B picture unit inflicted this one on the war time public. Very simply the area along the Sabine River where the film opens is cotton country just like the rest of the Deep South or at least the Deep South was post Civl War. No big cattle empires there	 they're much farther west in Texas	 farther than Richard Dix and Preston Foster could ride to set up their empire.<br /><br />The film begins with the two of them partners in a riverboat and when Leo Carrillo tries a theft of their services by not paying them for hauling his cattle	 they keep the cattle. And that's the beginning of the big Ponderosa like ranch they start.<br /><br />Along the way Foster marries Dix's sister played by Frances Gifford and feuds with his much smaller neighbors. They also have some further run ins with Leo Carrillo.<br /><br />Anyway	 us easterners who like westerns usually don't bother with geographical trifles and it's still a good western from the production mill of Harry Sherman who produced all those Hopalong Cassidy westerns for Paramount. The climax is a blazing	 and I mean that literally	 gun battle that should have maybe been used on an A production.<br /><br />But I wouldn't have any but western fans look at it."	0.0
"Jeffrey Combs is an insane scientist whose stem cell research has morphed into a diabolical scheme to create a hybrid hammerhead shark humanoid life form	 hoping to breed a brand new species using Hunter Tylo's womb. It won't be easy for Tylo is a tough broad and her boyfriend	 William Forsythe	 isn't about to give her up without a fight.<br /><br />You see Tylo and Forsythe are two of business executive Arthur Roberts' employees	 brilliant minds who meet Combs(..a scientist who once worked for Roberts	 and whose vacated position went to Tylo)at his island fortress where he conducts his research and experiments. This island affords him the opportunity to recruit fresh victims for his work and ""son"". They think it's a professional affair in regards to a breakthrough in stem cell research which could lead to cures for a variety of diseases. Combs' son was dying of kidney cancer when he decided to perform his mad science on him	 creating this blood-thirsty	 flesh-eating creature which can both swim and walk on dry land(..although	 at first the hammerhead could only remain outside for short time periods). Tylo was dating Combs' son	 hence the connection besides the two having worked for Roberts	 who brings along his trophy wife	 Mariya Ignatova. Also accompanying Tylo and Forsythe	 Roberts and Ignatova	 are their colleagues	 Elise Muller and GR Johnson. Combs traps them in a conference room	 but they are able to escape onto the island as he sends after them his well paid mercenaries and hammerhead shark son.<br /><br />Like similar sci-fi channel creature features of it's type	 Hammerhead:Shark Frenzy has some rather unappealing computer generated effects and the attacks(..where the shark rips apart limbs)are shot in a quick-edit	 frenzied camera format where you have a hard time ever seeing any of the ensuing gory carnage. You have this vague notion that a person is being eaten(..ripped to shreds)	 but the attacks themselves are shot in a very erratic fashion which	 truth be told	 is rather infuriating. The monster itself is never seen in it's entirety	 just momentary glimpses of an eye or a body part being gnawed on as the victim screams out in horror. One thing's for certain	 you do see teeth. We do get cgi shots of the hammerhead shark swimming toward the screen	 all menacing	 ready to feast on flesh. A constant is while(..and after)victims are attacked	 we see a great deal of blood and bits of flesh bubbling to the water's surface(..this is really director Michael Oblowitz's main cue as to inform the viewer that those being torn apart are goners).<br /><br />Combs doesn't break new ground as the scientist	 but he's always had an ability to convey a quiet madness under this cold-blooded resolve. It's fun seeing Forsythe in a rare clean-cut hero role	 very against type as an electronics wiz(..to his credit	 he actually pulls it off)who must assume a leadership position when the group faces unprecedented peril. Tylo is also in a very different kind of role	 a scientist who can defend herself quite well. Roberts can play the millionaire businessman roles in his sleep	 and it's kind of neat seeing him firing off a machine gun at Combs' soldiers(..although	 his fate is not pleasant). Mentioning that	 it was also really entertaining watching Forythe and Tylo downing Combs' hired goons with confiscated automatic machine guns. As expected	 the screenplay allows those who created the murderous fiend to put themselves in unnecessary danger just so that they can pay for their sins..I mean	 seriously	 would these people knowingly leave themselves so vulnerable to attack after seeing just what damage to the human anatomy it could do? Beautiful exotic setting is quite a nice backdrop."	0.0
EARTH is a must see for children and adults. My son had great fun watching all these funny birds and ice bears. We can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud on our great treasure on earth. There are some animals in danger to disappear. Exactly that problem should prevent all the authorities of our planet. <br /><br />This documentary offers many exceptional pictures that I have never seen before. Then it is well accompanied by a heavenly music. The director did a great job here that gets high respect. Nothing can stop me and my family to give EARTH the highest rate. I hope so much that the stuff will create a sequel.	1.0
"I was lucky enough to get a free pass to an advance screening of 'Scoop' last night. Full house at the theatre and when the movie ended there was spontaneous applause. I didn't speak to anyone who disliked 'Scoop' although two teenagers sitting next to me sighed and fidgeted uncomfortably for most of the film. They were the exception though because everyone else including myself really enjoyed themselves.<br /><br />'Scoop' is a quickly paced murder mystery. A young female journalism student is unwittingly maneuvered by forces beyond her control into trying to catch a serial killer on the loose. Plenty of hijinks ensue as she partners up with a traveling illusionist and falls in love with a frisky and charming young nobleman.<br /><br />'Scoop' isn't a bad addition to the Woody Allen filmography. It isn't his best work but it is a very enjoyable and light hearted romp. I'd say it fits quite comfortably into being an average Woody Allen film	 right in the middle of the pack. If you're a Woody Allen fan you'll probably enjoy yourself. If you're indifferent to his work then 'Scoop' might be enough to get you interested in seeing more. I don't think that anyone who dislikes his style of film-making and acting are going to change their mind. Woody plays the same kind of neurotic character we've grown so accustomed to although it borders dangerously close to forced and over the top in this film. While potentially aggravating for some who might find themselves wishing he'd hurry up and just spit out the words	 Woody Allen fans know what to expect.<br /><br />Very good performances all around in my opinion although I found myself missing Ian McShane who is excellent and not on camera nearly enough. Hugh Jackman is great as the charming nobleman and I think Woody Allen has found a new regular star to work with in Scarlett Johansson. I think that with 'Match Point' this is their second pairing and she's just magic with the material that Woody gives her. Could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship! I'm glad I saw the movie and definitely recommend it. More sophisticated comedy than movies like 'Scary Movie 4' so if your brand of comedy is the latter rather than the former	 'Scoop' probably isn't for you. If	 on the other hand	 you like a touch of class	 sophistication and fun	 'Scoop' is for you. Probably not the Woody Allen film I'd introduce to a newcomer but all others should give it a try."	1.0

"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS<br /><br />A couple of years back I managed to see the first five films in this franchise	 and was planning to do an overview of the whole Elm St. series. However	 just two years on and I find I can't remember enough about them in order to do it  I guess they couldn't have made much of an impression. From what I do recall	 some of the sequels  Dream Warriors in particular  weren't as bad as is often made out	 though even the original was no classic. Generally	 the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams) doesn't lend itself to narrative tension. But while I cannot recall much of the first five films	 I do know they never plumbed the depths of Freddy's Dead.<br /><br />An indication of how sick of Freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character's demise. The fact that the movie's conclusion is not even hidden	 but in fact the entire purpose for the film's being goes to illustrate how vacant	 soulless and cynical this venture was.<br /><br />Taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain	 Robert Englund's in-no-way-scary interpretation booms with laughter. I always thought Freddy's mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe. It's like Englund's crying out ""we know this is garbage  but you're paying to see it	 so who's the one laughing?"" And I'm sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight. Was Freddy's appearance in the films always so rudimentary? All he gets to do here is a few ""haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr  har  har  hars"" and that's it. If this was the only Elm St. film you'd ever seen you wouldn't get to know the character at all. Even as the character pre-death in a flashback Englund plays him as a boo-hiss pantomime villain with a slop of Transatlantic (ie. overstated	 misplaced and not at all funny) irony.<br /><br />Acting is almost universally poor. Just look at how many times Breckin Meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself	 Yaphet Kotto	 keeps his dignity. And when Roseanne	 Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper show up	 you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire. The script	 too	 is absolutely lousy	 almost wholly without merit. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a road map	 upon which the Noel Coward-like Freddy has wittily written ""you're f**ked"". When prompted for the map	 Carlos responds ""well the map says we're f**ked"". Who wrote the screenplay	 Oscar Wilde?<br /><br />Or how about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy	 his hearing enhanced to painful levels? So Freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin  a potentially fatal sound	 given that all sounds are magnified. Oddly	 the fact that Carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect. ""Nice hearing from you	 Carlos""	 quips Freddy	 hoping some better lines will come along. It's also worth noting that dream sleep doesn't occur instaneously	 so being knocked unconscious wouldn't allow instant access into Freddy's world. Though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3-D finale plot logic isn't that high on the list of requirements.<br /><br />The teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious	 dislikeable group in the whole series. Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only one who gets to greet Freddy with ""shut the f**k up	 man"" and a kick in the scallops. And was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients? Freddy's Dead. No laughs. No scares. No interest. No fun.<br /><br />"	0.0
"If there was a ZERO rating	 I would give it to this movie. Today was the second time I tried to watch it and I still couldn't make it through from beginning to end. I can't believe the multiple stars given by others & can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise! The acting is atrocious all around	 the script is blah	 the kid playing Nichole shows zero emotion even when she's being threatened. The ""southern"" accent from the actress playing Amber's mom is laughable - I'm from Georgia and have friends from Texas - believe me NOBODY talks like that! None of her emotions seemed real in any scene. The subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment."	0.0
"the single worst film i've ever seen in a theater. i saw this film at the austin film festival in 2004	 and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival. it was an interesting premise	 and seemed like it could go somewhere	 but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything. first of all	 if you're going to do a musical	 find someone with musical talent. the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming. the lyrics were terribly written	 and when they weren't obvious rhymes	 they were groan-inducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work. and you'd think you'd find people who could sing when making a musical	 right? not in this case. luckily they were half talking/half singing in rhyme most of the time	 but when they did sing it made me cringe. especially when they attempted to sing in harmony. and that just addresses the music. some of the acting was pretty good	 but a lot of the dialog was terrible	 as well as most of the scenes. they obviously didn't have enough coverage on the scenes	 or they just had a bad editor	 because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film. at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical. i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again."	0.0
"This is one of the best episode from the second season of MOH	 I think Mick Garris has a problem with women... He kill'em all	 they are often the victims (Screwfly solution	 Pro-life	 Valerie on the stairs	 I don't remember the Argento's episode in season 1	 etc.	 obviously Imprint). I think he enjoys to watch women been burn	 torture	 mutilated and I don't know. Never least ""Right to die"" is one of the best	 with good turns and graphic scenes and suspense (specially with the photos from the cell scene	 wonderful). The acting is like the entire series	 regular I could be worst like ""Pro-life"" or ""We scream for Ice cream"". Also I think the plot it could be made for a movie and not just for an episode. The ideology of the series is horrible	 killing and terminating women	 mutilating animals and on and on... the first season it was better than the second one with episodes like ""Cigarrette burns"" (The best of all)	 ""Homecoming"" (The most funny)	 ""Imprint"" (really shocking)."	1.0
"This film deals with the Irish rebellion in the 1920s and more specifically one man's life after he informs on a friend for the bounty on his head and the subsequent consequences. Watching the film	 I got the feeling that you could take the script and with just some minor updates	 do it again and it	 sadly	 would still fit contemporary events. But te remake wouldn't be nearly as good. A magnificent performance by Victor McLaglen (for which he deservedly got an Oscar) and a fine ensemble cast that includes most	 if not all the actors with brogues in Hollywood at the time	 most of them recognizable character actors either established at the time or just starting out. A very good film well worth watching. Highly recommended."	1.0
"Everyone has already commented on the cinematography (good to great)	 the personalities (larger than life)	 the structure (chronological	 with many references to surf culture through time). What is missed is a bigger question of sociological importance: chucking mainstream American culture for something more fulfilling and rewarding.<br /><br />I was a surfer in the 1970s. We used to watch 16mm films at the local high schools in SoCal. I remember the great feeling of surfing all day until my skin radiated heat	 putting on a Hawaiian shirt and shorts and going to watch the latest surf film at night. Often	 the narrator was the filmmaker himself	 reading a script off sheets of paper. Sometimes	 a surf band or proto-punk band would add music. I was never happier. Except for the hooting and hollering	 seeing 'Riding Giants' took me back in time.<br /><br />IT also reinforced a feeling that living life on the edge	 not worrying about the money and the climbing the social and corporate ladder	 not keeping up with the Joneses	 pushing yourself physically and mentally for a fleeting moment of joy and jubilation - may be the answer to the question	 ""what is the purpose of life?"" At least for those like Greg Noll	 Laird Hamilton and the like	 they seem to have found something that few of us are bold enough or honest with ourselves enough to pursue: to live life solely on our own terms. Maybe society would fall apart if we all did exactly what we wanted in life	 but it is wonderful to see people who actually are living out their dreams.<br /><br />It was this message that really impressed me."	1.0
"There is no denying that Ealing comedies are good	 but for me this film stands out as one of the best.<br /><br />The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy	 not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes	 and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from UK law	 rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system.<br /><br />They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right. In fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started	 that's where the moral comes in. It's when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender	 only to have the whole of London respond to their plight by sending food	 lot's of it. Thus enabling them to continue their struggle.<br /><br />This film hit's the right note throughout	 the acting is superb	 with Stanley Holloway	 Margaret Rutherford	 Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out. It's pitched just right	 not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat. Well worth a viewing"	1.0
"Neat premise. Very unrealistic. What I learned from this movie is that speeding crazily out of control to go to the weekend cabin may not be the best idea after all. I loved how Bill conveniently rolls out of the car and down the hill with no injury at all! Unfortunately	 the same can't be said for his gal. Oh	 and the police never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wreck.<br /><br />Lots of dragged out scenes including a plain stripper (still have nightmares from that scene). Poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand. I admit I was intrigued to see what the mysterious ""thing"" was behind the door	 but when it appeared	 I just laughed. HA HA HA!! The girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived. Personally	 I really would want a new body after an excruciating experience like that!"	0.0
"Two thirds of nearly 2	000 IMDb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8	 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes (Was this a record	 or merely a faulty VCR?). Although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination. But for some reason I imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it. My mind was changed by Elizbeth Von Arnim's original book. My wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form. Such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things	 but I gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing	 although in no way syrupy	 and was also very well written. I realised my wife would enjoy watching the film	 and so decided to buy her the videotape. I am now very glad that I did	 and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful pre-Mussolini Italian atmosphere. The story is set in the immediate post WW1 period and starts with two married London ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together	 away from their families	 in a rented villa in Italy. Force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds. Its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses	 not only between these four very disparate mature ladies	 but also with the occasional male visitor. If you want action	 thrills	 dramatic sex scenes	 natural or man-made disasters	 or Harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you. But IMDb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch	 and if you care to give it a try you may	 as I did	 come to rank it among your much loved films.<br /><br />It is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which I am already familiar. In many cases I find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film	 but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that I actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book	 effectively unrolled before my eyes. (Perhaps Italy itself has some part in this	 the last time I had this experience was when I was watching tales from Boccaccio's Decameron on TV.) Generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal	 but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events. This works very well	 although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story. Great credit is due to the Director	 Mike Newell	 and all members of the cast	 particularly those well known British Actresses who play the four principal ladies."	1.0
"This review may contain some spoilers.<br /><br />The remake of the classic 1974 car chase movie Gone in 60 Seconds begins well. Actually it is well acted and the plot moves quite well. But even a big Hollywood budget doesn't change the fact that the original plot was more believable. For those who don't know	 the original plot had the thieves working as insurance inspectors. Who would suspect them. But even with a change to nearly every aspect of H.B. Halicki's original	 the remake is a very good movie	 until we get to the final chase scene	 the part of the 74 version that made it great. The one in this version is watered down	 only 10 minutes	 and it culminates in a monster special effect that takes all believability out of the chase. Where the original chase was very believable	 the star was a stunt driver who did all his own stunt	 the remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes. My advice	 if you want to watch a classic car chase film	 fine the original in the bargain bin at your local rental joint and stay clear of the new remake."	0.0
"Doghi is a wonderful movie and Renuka Daftardar is excellent. So is Uttara Baokar who is usually excellent in most of her roles. Along with Kairee	 its an example of Marathi cinema at its best. There are certain parts in both movies that tend to the didactic - it would have probably enhanced the movie to not have the few scenes where the social message is hammered in. These scenes probably emerge from the film-maker's political concerns but the movie is realistic and moving enough to not need it. But apart from such minor quibbles	 its a movie that deserves to be seen more and one I strongly recommend. Sumitra Bhave's concern and humanism shines through."	1.0
"Having seen CUBE	 I've been a fan of Vincenzo Natali's work. Natali seems to have this inept ability to take a storyline	 and hardly wring it our like a wet towel for all the storyline he can muster. Instead	 he lets the stories themselves unfold in natural ways	 so much in fact	 that you may in fact believe there is this Cube were people try to escape	 or in the case of NOTHING	 a large empty expanse where there is... nothing! The advert had me hooked instantly. It seemed so simple! Take two characters who no one likes	 and send them to a world where there is nothing. Natali does this so simply that you forget the logic that a place where there is nothing cannot exist. In fact	 the world of nothing becomes something of an irony within the film. There's nothing there	 but also 'something' there.<br /><br />It might be a good time to point out that the trailer is highly misleading. I was fortunate enough to actually understand that the film leaned to a more comedic side than the trailer otherwise told so. Therefore upon watching the film	 i laughed every now and again	 whereas someone who the advert mislead may find themselves utterly confused.<br /><br />If i may take a minute to give the film some praise	 where the film excels on is the concept. It is a genius concept to have a world of nothing	 and to put two characters there	 NOT two brilliant minded characters	 who will philosophise and work out their surroundings	 but two idiots who have absolutely no clue as to where the hell they are! Another strong point is the film's cinematography	 though at first this may not seem it! Where each wall	 north	 earth	 south	 west	 up and down is just a white plane	 a perception of depth becomes faulty. It is hard to determine where things are placed in the Mis-En-Scene. The cinematography has many moments where this actually happens	 but for the most part	 the camera is placed so that two characters	 or an object and a character are placed in the foreground and background	 allowing a sense of depth to be realised.<br /><br />However	 this film does lack in certain areas. The film is relatively short	 but even so	 after a while the novelty of this world of nothing becomes rather dull	 and you wish to find some form of resolution within the plot. We can also argue that the acting is once again	 questionable. These two characters are in a sense	 unlikeable	 therefore we feel no sympathy at any point for these characters. However	 on a flip side of that	 the chemistry and friendship between the two characters seems real enough	 but there is something lacking.<br /><br />Even so	 i do rank this as a thoroughly enjoyable film! Do not let the trailer fool you into thinking this is another science-fiction horror film. It is much more of a comedy than that! It is indeed worth watching though	 purely for the concept itself!"	1.0
"It was a painful experience	 the whole story is actually there so I won't go into that but the acting was horrible there is this part in the very beginning when the scientist brother goes to work he actually wears a white coat at home before leaving to work	 I thought working with biohazard material meant that you should wear sterilized clothes in a controlled environment and the lab itself looks like a school lab there is this monitor on top a file cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene its just there to make the place look technical and a scientist is actually having breakfast in the lab and next to him is a biohazard labeled jar and his boss walks in on him and doesn't even tell him anything about it...not to mentioned bad acting very bad can't get any worst than that my advice don't watch and I thought nothing could be worse than house of the dead apparently Uwi Boll's movies look like classical Shakespeare compared to this!"	0.0

This thing was just a complete mess from the get go. Bad acting	 bad directing	 bad story and horrific cinematography. How this piece of garbage was released I will never know	 but it has and unfortunately I watched it. Filmed on location in Tennessee by the directing team of Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd)	 ""Five Across The Eyes"" I'm assuming is supposed to resemble a ""Blair Witch"" type film but falls short... Okay it nose dives off a cliff. I was actually embarrassed for these young women	 whom I'm sure were promised Hollywood stardom	 but ended up in this dung heap. The dialog is ridiculous	 and actually aggravates you as you listen to it. How this is supposed to be a horror flick is another mystery	 as there is nothing even remotely scary about it	 except for the fact that I watched it... Try this one on for size: There is 5 of you and 1 of her	 do the math and beat her ass... ""The End"". Saddly it went on (and on) for 95 more minutes of mind-numbing stupidity...<br /><br />I saw it for free	 and wanted my money back."	0.0

"This 1939 film from director John Ford and writer Lamar Trotti tells a fictional tale of young lawyer Abraham Lincoln	 his trials (literally) and his tribulations. It's a sentimental film	 reasonably well made but hardly breathtaking. The casting of Henry Fonda as Lincoln seems a mistake	 for while the actor had the right doleful qualities for the part	 even with several inches of makeup and a false nose he's way too handsome for Honest Abe	 who was famously homely. It's a good try from Fonda	 who's nothing if not sincere	 but his miscasting throws the entire film off. The supporting cast is excellent	 though	 and includes Alice Brady	 Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is too reverential in his treatment of Lincoln	 who is presented as just shy of a saint	 and in the final scene the movie goes way over the top."	1.0
"For some reason	 TV Guide gave this two and a half stars	 plus Faye Dunaway is in it	 so it definitely looked like something to see. My	 oh	 my	 this may be the worst film I've ever seen. Ever. From its horrid acting (every time the girl asks the boy what's wrong with him	 I shouted to the TV ""I can't act!"" When she asks what he needs	 I yell ""I need acting lessons!"" to the unbelievably bad dialog (""Give me back my organs!"").<br /><br />And the Brian DePalma wannabe ending	 too	 it was all just beyond awful. I wanted to like it. Dunaway is one of the best actors ever. And the production values were pretty good.<br /><br />But wowzers	 this had me laughing	 LAUGHING!	 most of the time.<br /><br />Don't even bother out of curiosity	 that was my first mistake. Staying with it was definitely my second	 and third and fourth."	0.0
"Poor performances by Sinatra	 Martin and Hyer. Grossly underdeveloped supporting characters. Annoying talky with no real plot. Ending leaves you flatter than a pancake	 with more loose ends than you could tie up in four sequels (that is	 if you even cared about these wooden characters). MacLaine is the only real asset. That penultimate sequence in which the ""Chicago hood"" searches for the Sinatra character is laughable. The music in that sequence also is poor. And in the final scene when Martin's character removes his hat for the woman he called a ""pig	"" almost made me go outside and find a stone to throw through my television screen."	0.0
"Made one year before ILSA	 SHE-WOLF OF THE SS	 BLACKSNAKE could have easily been called SUSAN	 SHE-WOLF OF THE PLANTATION and it probably inspired the producers behind the Nazi sexploitation epics to go ahead with their more infamous films because the stories are identical: a gorgeous	 horny	 head strong (but stupid) blonde woman degrades and kills many people under her control	 whom all hate her and want her dead. Sounds familiar? Director Russ Meyer and David Friedman	 the producer behind the ILSA flicks	 are good friends and they started their careers together. So	 obviously	 there's a connection there. Looking at BLACKSNAKE	 I can't help but think that Russ Meyer wanted to move on and do something else than his typical busty women epics because XXX movies were all the rage during the mid 1970s	 and Russ Meyer films	 though filled with nudity and kinkiness and violence	 were never even close to real porn. His films started to look positively quaint next to DEEP THROAT and other hard-core porno blockbusters. Meyer knew he couldn't compete with such films and BLACKSNAKE is sorta the end result of such a quandary in his career. He obviously wanted to branch out into different uncharted territory. But BLACKSNAKE bombed at the B.O. and Meyer quickly returned to making VIXEN type of films that	 even if they still weren't pornographic	 they were most definitely more over-the-top than any of his previous films.<br /><br />It's no wonder BLACKSNAKE was a B.O. failure. It's just terrible. Trash-o-rama. Jaw-droppingly bad. It's a quasi-campy take on slavery	 if you can imagine that. The end result is jarring. One minute	 we're in typical Meyer territory: exuberant	 playful and silly	 and then the next minute	 super serious meditation on slavery and violence. Huh? It just doesn't work. The slavery/racism aspect is woefully mishandled and veers this movie in the true exploitation category. But BLACKSNAKE is not as sleazy as ILSA SHE WOLF OF THE SS and those kind of films	 so I imagine fans of the latter were disappointed by it	 which would explain the almost lack of interest in this movie from either exploitation fans or Russ Meyer fans. Meyer blames the failure of BLACKSNAKE because	 and I quote	 ""It didn't have enough breasts in it."" Well	 I'm sorry Russ	 but the film is just bad	 breast or no breasts. But he's right though about the low breast quota. Except for Anouska and the maid	 the film's cast is male. Meyer replaces his usual bevy of buxom babes with throng of hunks with massive pecs	 in the form of anonymous black actors playing the slaves and the big David (Darth Vader) Prowse. And with Anouska's right hand man around	 who is portrayed as a ruthless but clever gay man who enjoys the power he has over the men	 one can only wonder what Meyer was really trying to create here.<br /><br />BLACKSNAKE stars David Warbeck	 who is lusted after by Anouska and her right hand man. Poor David. He looks totally befuddled by the whole experience. He did seem to have fun making the movie but you can clearly see that	 at times	 he has no idea what's going on. And then there's Anouska Hempel. She's a beautiful woman...for the 1970s	 not the 1870s. With her makeup and hair	 she looks like a typical 1970s Brit pin-up babe than a turn of the century dominatrix. And her wardrobe is hilarious. At one time	 she actually unzips her leather boots! I didn't know they had zippers in those days. But the character she plays is	 in itself	 really degrading (no pun intended). She's nothing but a cipher to the object of lust and scorn of every men (and that woman) on the island. For example	 one night	 when David and Anouska are getting it on	 her annoying slave driver walks in the room	 knocks David unconscious and tries to rape her	 groping her savagely. The next day	 the slave driver is still working for Anouska and the two act as if nothing had happened. It's totally ludicrous. Under any circumstance	 had her character been a real person	 Anouska would have whipped the slave driver senseless and kicked his butt off the island. Or even killed him. But the fact that the woman keeps him on her plantation after he tried to rape her is stretching the flimsy story and characters' credulity to the max.<br /><br />Ridiculous details like this	 and the thoroughly startling blaxploitation angle makes BLACKSNAKE a strangely unpleasant but watchable movie. Watchable in the train wreck variety. I just couldn't help but watch the film for the utter baseless aspects of it all (the excellent cinematography sorta makes it easier to watch). So	 this being an exploitation film	 I guess it succeeded in doing what it was supposed to do. But BLACKSNAKE is mainly for Russ Meyer completists."	0.0
"It is a pleasure to see such creativity on TV again. This show is poetic	 artistic and good fun. The characters relate well and the writing is not bad (I think it will improve as they get their legs). Definitely worth a look.<br /><br />The girls steal the show so far in this series. Chuck is adorable as is Olive. The two aunts are a delight. I sincerely hope they write them into bigger parts as they are magic.<br /><br />Well	 that's all the news that is fit to print. Go make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy something fun in an old fashioned way. This is like Dr. Seuss for adults."	1.0
"A 1957 (yes	 that's the correct date) J. Arthur Rank production with James Robertson Justice	 Margaret Rutherford	 Wilfred Hyde White; it has to be a smash comedy	 right? Oh	 it's just awful. It's a one gag film: watching people be shocked at the sight of a little alligator. Music is thrown in	 most inappropriately and forgettably. Jeannie Carson is a lively dancer and competent singer. But what was she doing in this film? Diana Dors is here too	 providing oh-so-daring shots for use in the previews. Her acting level is not bad	 but she's in the film to provide someone to leer at. Well	 one must do something beside groan during this film. The movie is being sold on VHS now by people on e-Bay. Spare yourself the expense and the waste of time. A comedy without a laugh. A musical without a memorable song or dance."	0.0
"What a let down! This started with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters. Admittedly it moved along at the speed of a snail	 but I was nevertheless gripped and kept watching.<br /><br />David Morrissey is always good value and he Suranne Jones were good leads. The Muslim aspects were very interesting. We were tantalised with possible terrorist connections.<br /><br />But then Morrissey's character was killed off and all the air left the balloon. The last episode was dull	 dull	 dull. The whole thing turned out to be very small beer and the dénouement was unbelievably feeble.<br /><br />Five hours of my life for that? My advice: watch paint dry instead."	0.0
"Released as Zentropa in North America to avoid confusion with Agniezska Holland's own Holocaust film Europa Europa	 this third theatrical feature by a filmmaker who never ceases to surprise	 inspire or downright shock is a bizarre	 nostalgic	 elaborate film about a naive American in Germany shortly following the end of WWII. The American	 named Leo	 doesn't fully get what he's doing there. He has come to take part in fixing up the country since	 in his mind	 it's about time Germany was shown some charity. No matter how that sounds	 he is not a Nazi sympathizer or so much as especially pro-German	 merely mixed up. His uncle	 who works on the railroad	 gets Leo a job as a helmsman on a sleeping car	 and he is increasingly enmeshed in a vortex of 1945 Germany's horrors and enigmas.<br /><br />This progression starts when Leo	 played rather memorably by the calm yet restless actor Jean-Marc Barr	 meets a sultry heiress on the train played by Barbara Sukowa	 an actress with gentility on the surface but internal vigor. She seduces him and then takes him home to meet her family	 which owns the company which manufactures the trains. These were the precise trains that took Jews to their deaths during the war	 but now they run a drab day-to-day timetable	 and the woman's Uncle Kessler postures as another one of those good Germans who were just doing their jobs. There is also Udo Kier	 the tremendous actor who blew me away in Von Trier's shocking second film Epidemic	 though here he is mere scenery.<br /><br />Another guest at the house is Eddie Constantine	 an actor with a quiet strength	 playing a somber American intelligence man. He can confirm that Uncle Kessler was a war criminal	 though it is all completely baffling to Leo. Americans have been characterized as gullible rubes out of their element for decades	 but little have they been more blithely unconcerned than Leo	 who goes back to his job on what gradually looks like his own customized death train.<br /><br />The story is told in a purposely uncoordinated manner by the film's Danish director	 Lars Von Trier	 whose anchor is in the film's breathtaking editing and cinematography. He shoots in black and white and color	 he uses double-exposures	 optical effects and trick photography	 having actors interact with rear-projected footage	 he places his characters inside a richly shaded visceral world so that they sometimes feel like insects	 caught between glass for our more precise survey.<br /><br />This Grand Jury Prize-winning surrealist work is allegorical	 but maybe in a distinct tone for every viewer. I interpret it as a film about the last legs of Nazism	 symbolized by the train	 and the ethical accountability of Americans and others who appeared too late to salvage the martyrs of these trains and the camps where they distributed their condemned shiploads. During the time frame of the movie	 and the Nazi state	 and such significance to the train	 are dead	 but like decapitated chickens they persist in jolting through their reflexes.<br /><br />The characters	 music	 dialogue	 and plot are deliberately hammy and almost satirically procured from film noir conventions. The most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones. Two trains halting back and forth	 Barr on one and Sukowa on another. An underwater shot of proliferating blood. An uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown. And most metaphysically affecting of all	 an anesthetic shot of train tracks	 as Max von Sydow's voice allures us to hark back to Europe with him	 and abandon our personal restraint."	1.0
"I never much liked the Myra movie	 tho I appreciate how it pushed the Hollywood envelope at the time. Certainly Miss Welch's costume became an iconic image	 though I have to wonder if many people who recognize the image really saw the film and know what it was all about -<br /><br />I rewatched Myra on FMC a couple of years ago and didn't think it had aged any better thru the years. There's a segment about it in the Sexploitation Cinema Cartoon History comic books	 where it's given proper credit for putting such big stars in what was then an outrageous production. However	 IMHO	 the movie is too bitter to be charming	 too silly to be a turn-on	 and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform	 engage	 OR entertain ---"	0.0
"David Mamet's film debut has been hailed by many as a real thinking-man's movie	 a movie that makes you question everybody and everything. I saw it for the first time recently and couldn't understand what was supposed to be so great about it.<br /><br />The movie is about a female psychologist named Margaret who is also a best-selling author. Margaret has become disillusioned by her profession and her inability to really help anyone. She tries to rectify this by helping settle her patient's gambling debt to a shark named Mike (played by Joe Mantegna	 who is the only reason to watch this film). She discovers that Mike is actually a professional confidence man when she nearly falls victim to a scam he pulls immediately after meeting her. Intrigued	 she returns to see him and asks him to show her how con artists operate (she plans on using this as the subject of a new psychology book). She then falls for him and accompanies him on a long con that he and his associates have set up.<br /><br />I don't feel like going into details	 but at the end of the film it is revealed that the events of the whole movie were an elaborate con by Mike and his cronies to swindle Margaret out of $80	000.<br /><br />First of all	 the big twist towards the end was VERY predictable. Any scene where the con men were operating was made very obvious by the stagey acting and weird line reads. Not only that	 but the audience (and the main character) knows that they're dealing with con men	 so is it really such a big surprise when we find out that Margaret has herself been conned? Besides	 Margaret is supposedly an intelligent psychologist who is an expert at reading people	 yet she allows herself to be duped far too easily -- and keep in mind	 she knows full well that Mike is a con artist.<br /><br />Secondly	 we are led to believe that Margaret was conned from the very beginning	 yet in order for the con to ultimately work	 she had to do several things that the con men couldn't possibly have predicted that she would do. First	 she had to decide to help settle her patient's debt	 allowing her to meet the con men in the first place. If she hadn't done this	 the entire con would have failed. I just have to say that it's pretty unreasonable to assume that a psychologist is going to take it upon herself to settle a patient's gambling debt. Not only that	 but what are the odds that the con men would be at the right spot on the very night she decided to show up? Did they simply show up at that bar every night	 hoping she would come and see them? Another thing that had to happen that couldn't have been predicted is that Margaret had to return to see Mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade. What are the odds of this happening? And yet the whole con is based on this premise.<br /><br />Another problem I had is with the ending. Margaret finds out she's been conned and decides to get revenge on Mike. At first	 Mamet leads us to believe that she's going to con the con	 but that falls through	 so the ultimate ending is her gunning Mike down in an airport baggage area. Somehow that just felt like a clumsy and inept way to end a movie about con artists plying their trade. Not only that	 but she didn't even take back the money he stole from her.<br /><br />Ultimately	 the movie leaves you feeling empty and unfulfilled. And if you	 like me	 predicted ahead of time that Margaret was going to be conned	 you will find this revelation just as unsatisfying."	0.0
"Man	 I really love the new DVD that Universal put out. I've never seen THE SENTINEL look this good since I had to put up with crappy	 grainy VHS tapes for years. Unfortunately there are no extras beyond a trailer that looks pretty worse for wear. And AVOID the Goodtimes DVD at all costs. It sucks.<br /><br />Anyway	 troubled fashion model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves into haunted NYC brownstone	 only it's more than just haunted. It's also a portal to hell and the Vatican keeps an old blind priest (John Carradine) to keep watch over it and make sure the devils and arch-angels don't escape. <br /><br />This has an all star cast full of old-timey actors like Ava Gardner	 Arthur Kennedy	 Jose Ferrer etc... as well as cameos of upcoming 80s stars including Christopher Walken	 Jeff Goldblum (who's voice was mysteriously overdubbed) and Tom Berenger. And you won't even recognize Jerry Orbach from LAW & ORDER. I had to do a double-take when I didn't quite place where I'd seen him before.<br /><br />Nice gore scenes of Alison slicing the eye and nose off her dead father's rotting corpse that's been possessed by the devil. And there's a neat ending where disfigured	 deformed people try to haunt Alison into committing suicide so she won't be the next one to guard the portal. It seems Alison's troubled past makes her a prime candidate by the Vatican to become the next sentinel.<br /><br />An excellent	 creepy 70s classic from director Michael Winner that shouldn't be missed. I also recommended it for those who want something a little more imaginative beyond the usual stupid teenager slashers and horror comedy.<br /><br />7 out of 10<br /><br />-"	1.0
"May I please have my $13.00 back? I would have rather watched ""Hydro- Electric Power Comes to North America"". Again. This is a movie with one voice. The same voice	 which comes out of every characters mouth regardless of age or gender. To listen to that voice again I would have to charge at least $150 an hour. And I don't take insurance. It was eerie watching Will Ferrell morph into Woody. But I don't think imaginative casting is enough. One should wait until they have a story before they bother making a movie. Unless he's just doing it for the money. And if that's the case why not just reissue an All-Rap version of ""What's up Tiger Lily?"""	0.0
"I'm 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise make a great pair. This movie is really funny and I love the songs. My favorite songs are ""You can't keep a good dog down"" and that song about sharing	 I think it's called ""What's mine is yours"". This was the last movie with Judith Barsi	 who played the voice of Anne-Marie. My favorite character is Charlie but I find Itchy's voice is so fun to hear. Although some scenes I actually found scary	 I still have a hard time watching the scene with Charlie's dream	 and Carface scares the crap out of me. Other characters like King Gator I found really funny. The ending was adorable and was actually sad	 made me cry a little. I give this movie 7/10."	1.0
"I remember loving this show when I was a kid. I thought the helicopter was the coolest thing I've seen. It was ultra high-tech for it's time. It could repel enemy fire	 do all sorts of acrobatics in the air	 and take down nearly anything in it's way. Now I go back and watch it today and am surprised how lousy this show really is. The casts members are hardly compelling	 there are a lot of cheesy moments	 and the fight scenes are incredibly fake looking. And nearly every ending has the same helicopter fighting crap with the obvious reuse of grainy low quality stock footage. Lot of the footages appear to date from the Vietnam War era.<br /><br />Airwolf has basically the same theme as Knight Rider	 except the crime-fighting vehicle of choice is a helicopter instead of a car. After watching a few episodes	 I found myself utterly bored. I do	 however	 love the theme music."	0.0

"After the SuperFriends and Scooby Doo left the Saturday morning airwaves in the fall of 1986	 I pretty much stopped watching Saturday morning cartoons at that point since those were the only two that kept me tuning in. And since neither the Real Ghostbusters nor the Flintstone Kids seemed very promising to me	 I ""retired"" and started sleeping in on Saturday mornings. I only returned to Saturday morning TV in 1988 for that one year only for one and only one animated show. <br /><br />A new animated show of Superman was something I was not going to pass up. I was 17 and in high school at the time	 but so what! I loved this show. From what I can recall	 this series was a gift to fans I suppose in celebration of Superman's 50th birthday that particular year. It had the theme music and the music style reminiscent of John Williams movie score from the Richard Donner/Christopher Reeve Superman movies. I honestly felt that the animation style Ruby Spears did was reminiscent of the Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians series by Hanna Barbera a few years before. Sadly	 Danny Dark was not back as Superman	 but I felt Beau Weaver did a very impressive job as the voice of Superman and his Clark Kent was nerdy like the Chris Reeve version. After hearing him as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic on the 90's Fantastic Four	 I could still see this version of Superman in my mind. Ginny McSwain as Lois Lane. LOL! What a rhyme. She was a voice director for Hanna Barbera and Ruby Spears and I guess she took it upon herself to do Lois. Memories of the SuperFriends lingered in this series when it came to the voice over cast. Jimmy Olsen is Mark Taylor	 who on the SuperFriends was formerly Firestorm. Perry White is none other than former Batman TV writer Stanley Ralph Ross	 who on SuperFriends was Gorilla Grodd and Brainiac in the Super Powers shows. And Lex Luthor	 now a wise cracking billionaire tycoon is none other than SuperFriends voice alum	 Michael Bell	 whom I know best as Zan and the Riddler as well as many other characters on many other series. <br /><br />I felt this series was a combination of the movie Superman along with the post crisis John Byrne re envision of Superman	 with Lex Luthor as a billionaire tycoon	 Jonathan and Martha Kent being alive to see Clark as Superman. The Bruce Timm series and Lois and Clark would also do this. Unfortunately	 we never saw Brainiac	 Bizarro	 Toyman	 Metallo	 or Darkseid. Other than Luthor	 we saw only the Prankster and we did see General Zod. I especially enjoyed that one episode with Wonder Woman	 who was voiced over by BJ Ward who played her on the Super Powers Team as well. <br /><br />The episodes were smashing and I also enjoyed Clark's growing and development stories from infancy to childhood to adolescence to an adult moving to Metropolis in the short little segment	 Superman's Family Album. <br /><br />The only two things I didn't like. It only lasted one season. And after Wonder Woman's guest spot	 I was hoping Batman would turn up voiced over by Adam West (Still thinking about the Super Powers Team episodes I guess). I also hoped for it because on the Prankster episode	 the Metropolis baseball team was pitted against the Gotham Goliaths. <br /><br />Every popular Super Hero has one cartoon series that is ultra rare. For SpiderMan	 I feel it's the 1981 solo series that aired the same time as Amazing Friends. For the Incredible Hulk	 it's the 1982 cartoon. For the Fantastic Four	 it's the 1978 series with HERBIE the Robot. For Batman	 it's the New Adventures of Batman 1977 by Filmation featuring BatMite. But for Superman	 the rarest series is this one. <br /><br />Superman books and documentaries never cover or mention it. This is another series that WB should consider for DVD release. All in all	 this 1988 version of Superman is well....Super!!"	1.0
"Cuba Gooding Jr. is a secret service agent who blames himself over the assassination of the U.S. President	 i'll point out straight away that this is not the type of role that this very talented actor is noted for	 and this film shows us why.

"Ever notice how in his later movies Burt Reynolds' laugh sounds like screeching brakes?<br /><br />Must have been hanging out with Hal Needham too much.<br /><br />And from the looks of ""Stroker Ace""	 WAY too much.<br /><br />Can you believe this was based on a book? Neither could I	 but it was. And probably not a best-seller	 I'll wager. <br /><br />Burt's another good-old-boy in the NASCAR circuit who hitches up with Beatty as a fried chicken magnate with designs on his team. Anderson provides what love interest there is and Nabors does his umpteenth Gomer Pyle impression as faithful mechanic/best friend Lugs. <br /><br />A lot of people here are friends of Burt's or Hal's. Others must have needed the work. And even real NASCAR drivers get in on the act	 and look to have more talent than those with SAG cards. <br /><br />As far as laughs go	 Bubba Smith (pre-""Police Academy"") gets them as Beatty's chauffeur. And Petersen	 in full Elvira mode	 gets lots of appreciative leers as a lady who wants to get to know Lugs real well. REAL WELL.<br /><br />It's a shame that Burt threw away as much time and effort in a film like ""Stroker Ace"" where it didn't matter whether he bothered to act or not. They didn't bother to write a character for him	 why bother to act?<br /><br />Two stars. Mostly for Petersen	 and for the out-takes at the end. Now THEY'RE funny."	0.0
"Are we talking about the same movie? This movie is totally ridiculous	 the plot is disgusting and completely without logic.

"Military training films are becoming so common that they are becoming a genre unto themselves. Among the more prominent we have	 `Officer and a Gentleman'	 `Top Gun'	 `GI Jane'	 and now `Men of Honor'. The fact that this one happened to be true doesn't change the fact that the formula is the same. This film is probably most like `GI Jane' since it focuses on the desegregation angle.<br /><br />The story is actually quite inspirational and is probably the best human-interest story among those mentioned above. Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding	 Jr.) is unquestionably a man of great courage and principle	 and his strength of character shines through brightly in this film. Unfortunately	 director George Tillman has tunnel vision in presenting the characters and eschews character development of various characters other than Brashear in favor of showing Brashear in a constant state of adversity. Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) is a central figure	 and except for the initial scene	 the fistfight and a couple of scenes with his wife	 we don't know much about him. For instance	 Brashear sees the scars on Sunday's palms and we are to assume that he worked a plow	 but there is no follow-up on that point. Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) gets only one short scene by which we can judge him. The rest of his screen time shows him pacing around and ranting. If a director is going to make a human-interest story	 he needs to humanize the characters.<br /><br />Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an outstanding performance as Brashear. This is probably the best I've seen him. This is a role and a character that is far more complete than any part he has played before	 and he rises to the occasion. In `Jerry Maguire'	 Rod Tidwell was a fascinating	 but one-dimensional character with the depth of a rain puddle. Brashear is much more complex and grounded	 and the issues he faces are life crises	 making the part far more challenging. This is an excellent recovery from Gooding's last role in `Chill Factor'	 a film so dreadful that it was almost an act of professional suicide to take the part.<br /><br />After a stint trying his hand as a comedian (`Analyze This'	 `The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle'	 `Meet The Parents')	 Robert DeNiro is back to his dramatic roots with an outstanding performance. DeNiro isn't a bad comedian	 he is just such a great dramatic actor that it seems like he shouldn't waste his time doing comedy. DeNiro endows Billy Sunday with a rock hard personality belying a tortured soul. It is a pleasure watching him work. <br /><br />It seems every film I watch lately has Charlize Theron in it. I saw `The Legend of Bagger Vance'	 `Men of Honor' and `The Yards' right in a row and I was beginning to wonder if she had a part in every film in 2000 (actually	 she only did five). This was a minor role for Theron	 but she carried it off well and managed to stay with DeNiro step for step. David Keith	 who co-starred with Richard Gere in `Officer and a Gentleman'	 has a cameo here<br /><br />The DVD has some interesting special features	 including reflections by the real Carl Brashear and some deleted scenes.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film despite the hackneyed plot and the one-dimensional presentation. I rated it a 7/10. I'm a sucker for underdog stories and I have a fondness for stories where strength of character is the central theme. This film is particularly strong in both areas and brings us two memorable acting performances that compensate for some of the director's shortcomings."	1.0
"I took part in a little mini production of this when I was a bout 8 at school and my mum bought the video for me. I've loved it ever since!! When I was younger	 it was the songs and spectacular dance sequences that I enjoyed but since I've watched it when I got older	 I appreciate more the fantastic acting and character portrayal. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant. I can't imagine anyone else playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. Shani Wallis' Nancy if the best character for me. She put up with so much for those boys	 I think she's such a strong character and her final scene when... Well	 you know... Always makes me cry! Best musical in my opinion of all time. It's lasted all this time	 it will live on for many more years to come! 11/10!!"	1.0
"This is the only full length feature film about the world of bridge. I found the first 10 minutes a bit slow	 but after that	 the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living. <br /><br />Some of the scenes are very funny. I don't think that a non-bridge player would get the charm of this movie. <br /><br />Some of the dresses are really beautiful	 pity the movie is in black and white - I can only imagine what they would look like in color. The way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious. There is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that. <br /><br />Watch it as soon as you can	 and tell your friends about it."	1.0
What a pathetic movie.<br /><br />I won't waste much time commenting about it. I'm still trying to get back the couple hours I wasted on it.<br /><br />Let me leave it simply with - Shaq has NO BUSINESS being an actor or singer. He is utterly without talent at both discplines. It's a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut CDs.<br /><br />Much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no-talent that is Shaq.	0.0
"Martin Weisz	 who directed the solid ""Rohtenburg""	 will be taking the heat	 with Wes Craven	 for another shabby ""The Hills Have Eyes 2"". The memory of the legendary original	 which boasted an unbelievable storyline and a dog having a flashback	 will be erased forever by this more technically polished remake (in name only). A bunch of National Guardsmen (and women) are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants. One by one the weekend soldiers are picked off. That's it. There is some hardcore violence and a reasonably brutal rape scene	 but there is precious little else to get excited about. The film's ""heroes"" are the usual bunch of clichés and the mutants	 a far cry from Craven's original ""family""	 mostly resemble Brian Thompson from ""Cobra"" coupled with some creatures Stan Winston had left over from the ""Wrong Turn"" shoot. Much of the action takes place in caves	 ala ""The Descent""	 and is well shot by Sam McCurdy. A laughable aspect is Wes and Jonathan Craven's addition of a sympathetic mutant who skulks around his cave like Leatherface in Hooper's original ""Chainsaw"". Weisz will be blamed for this dull debacle	 but he's not really at fault because he does his best to maintain suspense and squeeze some freshness out of the contrived situations. Not a fan	 unfortunately."	0.0

Whoever made this nonsense completely missed the point. Jane is a silly comic strip to titillate without being sleazy.<br /><br />This giant mess tries to be funny and exciting but is just a shambles. There is not one decent performance in it..even the usually reliable Jasper Carrott is painfully unfunny.<br /><br />The American bloke whose name escapes me is just as rubbiush as he was in flash gordon.<br /><br />Maud Adams tries as a villianess but she is a bit long in the tooth for this type of thing.

"In order to rate this movie fairly you have to think about the genre it's supposed to be: children's. They had more guidelines to follow in order to make this movie (meaning it could not get away with some of the humor and or language from the 1st) taking all that in this movie was fun and enjoyable to watch. Sequels usually make me nervous	 however this one did pretty well for itself. Knowing that it didn't have the star power of Fraiser as George they capitalized on the humor and i believe Showeman did pretty well as the lead. The plot being easy to follow and maybe campy at times fits well for a younger audience	 if you want to watch a movie and hope for academy award honors this is not it	 but if you want to watch a simple	 fun	 energy filled movie you would make a good choice with this one."	1.0
"A stuttering plot	 uninteresting characters and sub-par (to say the least) dialogue plagues this TV production that could hardly have been interesting even with a billion dollar production budget.<br /><br />The characters aren't believable	 in their motives	 actions or their professed occupations. The plot reads like a bad Dungeons and Dragons(TM) hack but with plasma rifles and force fields. There are severe continuity issues and the degree of pointless interaction between the characters has this author	 at least	 wincing. <br /><br />Avoid it like the plague. Watch any episode of Dark Angel and you will have better acting	 dialogue and plot. Yuck."	0.0
"Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) is having problems in her marriage and otherwise--enough to see a psychologist. When her promiscuity gets her into trouble	 it also involves a bystander	 Liz Blake (Nancy Allen)	 who becomes wrapped up in an investigation to discover the identity of a psycho killer.<br /><br />Dressed to Kill is somewhat important historically. It is one of the earlier examples of a contemporary style of thriller that as of this writing has extensions all the way through Hide and Seek (2005). It's odd then that director Brian De Palma was basically trying to crib Hitchcock. For example	 De Palma literally lifts parts of Vertigo (1958) for Dressed to Kill's infamous museum scene. Dressed to Kill's shower scenes	 as well as its villain and method of death have similarities to Psycho (1960). De Palma also employs a prominent score with recurrent motifs in the style of Hitchcock's favorite composer Bernard Herrmann. The similarities do not end there.<br /><br />But De Palma	 whether by accident or skill	 manages to make an oblique turn from	 or perhaps transcend	 his influence	 with Dressed to Kill having an attitude	 structure and flow that has been influential. Maybe partially because of this influence	 Dressed to Kill is also deeply flawed when viewed at this point in time. Countless subsequent directors have taken their Hitchcock-like De Palma and honed it	 improving nearly every element	 so that watched now	 after 25 years' worth of influenced thrillers	 much of Dressed to Kill seems agonizingly paced	 structurally clunky and plot-wise inept.<br /><br />One aspect of the film that unfortunately hasn't been improved is Dressed to Kill's sex and nudity scenes. Both Dickinson and Allen treat us to full frontal nudity (Allen's being from a very skewed angle)	 and De Palma has lingering shots of Dickinson's breasts	 strongly implicit masturbation	 and more visceral sex scenes than are usually found in contemporary films. Quite a few scenes approach soft-core porn. I'm no fan of prudishness--quite the opposite. Our culture's puritanical	 monogamistic	 sheltered attitude towards sex and nudity is disturbing to me. So from my perspective	 it's lamentable that Dressed to Kill's emphasis on flesh and its pleasures is one of the few aspects in which others have not strongly followed suit or trumped the film. Perhaps it has been desired	 but they have not been allowed to follow suit because of cultural controls from conservative stuffed shirts.<br /><br />De Palma's direction of cinematography and the staging of some scenes are also good enough that it is difficult to do something in the same style better than De Palma does it. He has an odd	 characteristic approach to close-ups	 and he's fond of shots from interesting angles	 such as overhead views and James Whale-like tracking across distant cutaways in the sets. Of course later directors have been flashier	 but it's difficult to say that they've been better. Viewed for film-making prowess	 at least	 the museum scene is remarkable in its ability to build very subtle tension over a dropped glove and a glance or two while following Kate through the intricately nested cubes of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.<br /><br />On the other hand	 from a point of view caring about the story	 and especially if one is expecting to watch a thriller	 everything through the museum scene and slightly beyond might seem too slow and silly. Because of its removal from the main genre of the film and its primary concern with directorial panache (as well as cultural facts external to the film)	 the opening seems like a not very well integrated attempt to titillate and be risqué. Once the first murder occurs	 things improve	 but because of the film's eventual influence	 much of the improvement now seems a bit clichéd and occasionally hokey.<br /><br />The performances are mostly good	 although Michael Caine is underused	 and Dickinson has to exit sooner than we'd like (but the exit is necessary and very effective). Dressed to Kill is at least likely to hold your interest until the end	 but because of facts not contained in the picture itself	 hasn't exactly aged well. At this point it is perhaps best to watch the film primarily as a historical relic and as an example--but not the best	 even for that era--of some of De Palma's directorial flair."	1.0
"(48 out of 278 people found this comment useful	 and counting...)<br /><br />People are such suckers for image and looks - as much as for the intellectually hollow ""idealism"" that lurks behind Communism. Che's charisma and looks have as much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by Leftist propaganda (such as this movie) about him.<br /><br />I don't know what's worse: being captured by one of Che's murder-squads or having to sit through 4 hours of this typically Soderberghian garbage. The question isn't why this pet-project was made but what took them so long. By ""them"" I'm referring	 of course	 to Left-wing Hollywood and its ""secret"" love of Marxist tyrants (Lenin	 Castro... take your pick). I am fascinated that it took decades for one of Tinseltown's least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project. Where was Oliver Stone all these years? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Beatty? Alan Pakula? George Clooney? Barbra Streisand even? It's a mystery. All these overrated ""artists"" have often indulging themselves in similar	 politically one-sided projects	 yet somehow Che Guevara	 who is arguably the most popular and well-known Communist	 hasn't been a film topic of theirs yet.<br /><br />""Guerrilla"" has all the hallmarks of an American truth-bending story of an epic scale; there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar Hollywood big-budget political fairy-tale bios such as ""Malcolm X"" or ""Gandhi""	 i.e. almost none. The movie stars Del Toro as the famous Argentinian revolutionary. Nevertheless	 however controversial and criminal this man's actions may have been	 one thing nobody could take away from him: he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family - which is why Del Toro fits the bill only visually. Del Toro may be an interesting	 charismatic actor and he may resemble Guevara physically	 but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever	 hence he makes Guevara come off as too primitive. Casting such mediocrities as Bratt	 Philips and Franka Incompetente only underlines the director's lack of sound judgment.<br /><br />The movie is to the most part extremely slow (no surprise there)	 and visually uninteresting. Even a director as brilliant as Kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the 3-hour mark	 so it's quite telling that this Soderbergh	 who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career	 would think that His Oceanic Grandness was up to the task. If you think the film's length indicates that a bulk of Che's life has been shown here - then think again. Soderbergh focuses on Che's last phase	 and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense	 full of Guevara's alleged idealism. (Psychopaths don't have ideals.) I do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of Che's earlier life. Did he actually consider it too uninteresting? A massacre of 600 people holds no interest for the viewer	 huh? Amazing. Some much better directors than this over-praised charlatan would have easily fit not one but two complete biographies into a 4-hour movie.<br /><br />Soderbergh	 in a sense	 becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative	 dark side - which is more than 90% - of Guevara. By spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy	 consciously ignoring the ugly truth (God forbid he should taint the holy image of Che)	 Soderbergh proves himself not a humanist - a fake image which most Hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold - but the opposite: that he cares only about ideas	 never about the people on whom these ideas are tested (like on guinea pigs). Soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind; such people often have a latent contempt for the ""proleteriat"" (what a stupid term) they're supposedly siding with.<br /><br />Half of all students around the world wear Che's image on their red and orange shirts	 but without ever knowing why. He has become an iconic figure for clueless	 uninformed	 very often young people	 who think that by having this man's face on their chest that somehow makes them appear ""edgy""	 intellectual	 hip or interesting. In reality	 wearing a Che shirt only underlines one's overall shallowness and total disinterest in self-education. (Wouldn't YOU want to find out more about a person before you start advertising his/her face to the world?) Wearing Che's by-now cliché image has become as common as having a Bart Simpson coffee cup. All those ""Che-wearers"" probably know more about Marge's blue hair than they'll ever read up on about Fidel Castro's dead ally.<br /><br />After everything that'd been done in the name of Marx	 one would think that these mongrel ""ideals"" would be finally laid to rest. It seems mankind will never learn. Stalin	 Mao	 Kim Il	 Pol Pot	 Castro	 Milosevic	 Ceausescu	 the Iron Curtain	 a hundred million dead	 more than a billion ruined physically and/or mentally through this system... so none of that matters	 huh? <br /><br />The fact that Del Toro won a Cannes Award should only surprise those who are absolutely clueless as to how Cannes and other European festivals work - and vote.

"Ernst Lubitsch's contribution to the American cinema is enormous. His legacy is an outstanding group of movies that will live forever	 as is the case with ""The Shop Around the Corner"". This film has been remade into other less distinguished movies and a musical play	 without the charm or elegance of Mr. Lubitsch's own	 and definite version.<br /><br />Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked in several films together. Their characters in this movie stand out as an example of how to be in a movie without almost appearing to be acting at all. Both stars are delightful as the pen pals that don't know of one another	 but who fate had them working together in the same shop in Budapest.<br /><br />The reason why these classic films worked so well is the amazing supporting casts the studios put together in picture after picture. In here	 we have the wonderful Frank Morgan	 playing the owner of the shop. Also	 we see Joseph Schildkraut	 Felix Bressart	 William Tracy and Charles Smith	 among others	 doing impressive work in making us believe that yes	 they are in Budapest.<br /><br />That is why these films will live forever!"	1.0
"""A Cry in the Dark"" is a masterful piece of cinema	 haunting	 and incredibly though provoking. The true story of Lindy Chamberland	 who	 in 1980	 witnessed a horrific sight	 seeing her 3-month-old baby being brutally taken from their family's tent	 while camping on the Austrailian outback. Azaria (the baby) was never seen again	 and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world. Meryl Streep does immaculate justice to the role of Lindy	 as she always does. But the one thing that helps ""A Cry in the Dark"" never fall flat is the brilliant direction. A truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case	 tears are brought to the eyes. The concept is nothing less then terrifying	 and afterwards you are left haunted	 but also inspired."	1.0
"WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS (but not really - keep reading). Ahhh	 there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that I won't have room to list them all. The opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late 1950s cartoon stills; an enchanting Peres 'Prez' Prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited (but his grunts are unmistakable	 and no-one else did them); and with familiar cast names	 including Kathy Najimi a full year before she hit with Sister Acts 1 & 2 plus Teri Hatcher from TV's Superman.<br /><br />Every scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors	 actresses and producers in daytime TV. Peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an old-fashioned	 delicious farce. Robert Harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of MAD Magazine	 but feels like a gift to us in the audience. Some of the cliched characters are a bit dim	 but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy	 especially against Celeste Talbert (Sally Field) who is the show's perennial award-winning lead	 nicknamed ""America's Sweetheart"". The daytime Emmies-like awards opening does introduce us to Celeste's show	 The Sun Also Sets. Against all vain fears to the contrary	 Celeste wins again. She is overjoyed	 because it's always ""such a genuine thrill"": ""Adam	 did you watch? I won! Well	 nguh..."" The reason for Adam's absence soon becomes the justification for the entire plot	 and we're instantly off on a trip with Celeste's neuroses. She cries	 screeches	 and wrings her hands though the rest of the movie while her dresser Tawnee (Kathy Najimi	 constantly waddling after Celeste	 unseen through Celeste's fog of paranoia) indulges a taste for Tammy Faye Baker	 for which Tawnee had been in fact specifically hired.<br /><br />Rosie Schwartz (Whoopi Goldberg) has seen it all before. She is the head writer of the show	 and she and Celeste have been excellent support networks to each other for 15 years. So when Celeste freaks	 Rosie offers to write her off the show for six months: ""We'll just say that Maggie went to visit with the Dalai Lama."" But Celeste has doubts: ""I thought that the Dalai Lama moved to LA."" ""-Well	 then	 some other lama	 Fernando Lamas	 come on!"". Such a skewering line must be rather affronting to still living beefcake actor Lorenzo Lamas	 son of aforementioned Fernando Lamas (d. 1982).<br /><br />Those who can remember the economics teacher (Ben Stein) in Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) as he deadeningly calls the roll (""Bueller. Bueller. Bueller"")	 will take secret pleasure from seeing him again as a nitwit writer. Other well hidden member of the cast include Garry Marshall (in real life Mr Happy Days and brother of Penny)	 who ""gets paid $1.2 million to make the command decisions"" on The Sun Also Sets - he says he definitely likes ""peppy and cheap""; and Carrie Fisher as Betsy Faye Sharon	 who's ""a bitch"".<br /><br />Geoffrey Anderson (Kevin Kline) is the ""yummy-with-a-spoon"" (and he is	 by the way) dinner theater actor now rescued from his Hell by David Seaton Barnes (Robert Downey Jr)	 and brought back to the same show he was canned from 20 years earlier. Of course this presents some logical challenges for the current scriptwriters because his character	 Rod Randall	 was supposed to have been decapitated all those years ago. Somehow they work out the logical difficulties	 and Geoffrey Anderson steps off the choo-choo.<br /><br />Celeste can now only get worse	 and her trick of going across the Washington bridge no longer helps. First	 her hands shake as she tries to put on mascara	 but she soon degenerates into a stalker. Unfortunately	 she cannot get rid of Geoffrey Anderson so easily. Geoffrey's been promised development of his one-man play about Hamlet	 and he means to hold the producer to that promise. ""I'm not going back to Florida no-how!""	 argues Geoffrey. ""You try playing Willie Loman in front of a bunch of old farts eating meatloaf !"" And indeed	 seeing Geoffrey's dinner theater lifestyle amongst all the hocking and accidents is hilarious. Back in Florida in his Willie Loman fat suit in his room	 Geoffrey Anderson used to chafe at being called to stage as ""Mr Loman"". He was forced to splat whatever cockroaches crawled across his TV with a shoe	 and to use pliers instead of the broken analog channel changer. Now he find himself as the yummy surgeon dating Laurie Craven	 the show's new ingenue; so he's not leaving.<br /><br />Beautiful Elizabeth Shue (as Laurie) rounds out the amazing ensemble cast who all do the fantastic job of those who know the stereotypes all too well. But	 of course	 the course to true love never did run smoothly. Montana Moorehead (Cathy Moriarty) is getting impatient waiting for her star to rise	 and is getting desperate for some publicity.<br /><br />Will her plots finally succeed? Will Celeste settle her nerves	 or will she kill Tawnee first? Will the producer get Mr Fuzzy? -You'll just have to watch * the second half * of this utterly lovable	 farcically malicious riot.<br /><br />And you'll really have to see to believe how the short-sighted Geoffrey reads his lines without glasses live off the TelePrompter. If you are not in stitches with stomach-heaving laughter and tears pouring down your face	 feel free to demand your money back for the video rental. Soapdish (1991) is an unmissable gem that you will need to see again and again	 because it's not often that a movie can deliver so amply with so many hilarious lines. This is very well-crafted humor	 almost all of it in the writing. A draw with Blazing Saddles (1974) for uproarious apoplexy value	 although otherwise dissimilar. Watch it and weep. A happy source for anyone's video addiction. 10 out of 10."	1.0

This first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they weren't very funny and had a drama element where Bill (the mother) was struggling with all the usual problems in life but that element was a bit depressing and didn't mix well with th comedy elements which is probably why it was dropped. After that it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the BBC have ever made! The chemistry between Bill and Ben's character's were very funny and there was always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series. The Christmas specials were hilarious and a real treat for Christmas. <br /><br />The show came to a stop when the main actor Gary Olsen playing Bill passed away which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films such as Up 'n' Under and a very funny man RIP<br /><br />This underrated show has sadly disappeared from our television screens and doesn't to be repeated that often - Though it does appear on UKTV Gold once in a while but it should be repeated on BBC one or two to show this brilliant Comedy to a new audience	1.0
"The Last Hunt is the forgotten Hollywood classic western. The theme of genocide via buffalo slaughter is present in other films but never so savagely. Robert Taylor's against-type role as the possessed buffalo and Indian killer is his finest performance.<br /><br />In the 1950s	 your mom dropped you and your friends off at the Saterday matinée	 usually featuring a western or comedy.

Because they featured ""safe"" Hollywood stars like Taylor and John Wayne. But the climatic scene in The Last Hunt is as horrifying as Vincent Price's mutation in The Fly.<br /><br />The mythology of the white buffalo	 part of the texture of this movie	 was later ripped-off by other movies including The White Buffalo	 starring Charles Bronson as Wild Bill Hickock.

"This is my third comment here attempting to connect two legendary movie comedy teams: Laurel & Hardy and Abbott & Costello. The connection here is the year 1940. That's the date that the former had their last movie from their longtime home studio of Hal Roach. I'll mention the significance of the latter later on. Besides being the last time Stan and Ollie worked at the Lot of Fun	 it's also the final time they would appear with such familiar supporting players like Charlie Hall and James Finlayson who appeared in most of their films. It's also the last time Art Lloyd would serve as their cameraman and Marvin Hatley-who composed their theme song which would be known as ""The Cuckoo Song (Dance of the Cuckoos)""-their score. And it would be the very last time Stan Laurel would be allowed to exercise complete creative control over what goes on film. If there is a more gag-laden structure than usual in this L & H film	 it's nice to know most of those gags are indeed funny. That includes most of the sound and visual effects	 the latter provided by longtime Roach staffer Roy Seawright. In this one	 Ollie has ""hornophobia"" from working at a noisy horn factory so Dr. Finlayson prescribes going out to sea for his rest. Ollie doesn't like to go boating so Stan suggests they just rent one that's docked so they wouldn't have to go anywhere. After they find one they like	 we find out that convict Nick Grainger (Richard Cramer) has just escaped...I'll stop there and say this was as good a finale for L & H's longtime home as one could hope for. It's hilarious mostly from beginning to end and knowing this would be their last for the man partly responsible for their teaming is indeed poignant when one thinks of it. Oh	 and I have a couple more lasts to mention: it's the final film appearance of both Harry Bernard	 who plays a harbor patrolman after years of encountering Stan and Ollie as a policeman	 and that of Ben Turpin	 the cross-eyed comic who was born in New Orleans which is a couple of hours away from my current hometown of Baton Rouge	 whose second L & H appearance this was having previously ""married"" the boys in Our Wife. The latter performer especially has a genuine comic moment. All right	 I mentioned 1940 being the year Stan and Ollie had their last movie released from Hal Roach Studios. It was also the first year that a comedy team	 both born in the state of New Jersey	 would make their first picture at what would be their home studio	 Universal. The director of that movie would be the same one that guided L & H in The Flying Deuces the previous year. His name was A. Edward Sutherland. P.S. It was during this filming that script supervisor Virginia Lucille Jones had an accident involving a rolled-up carpet. That incident caused Oliver ""Babe"" Hardy to send her roses to her hospital room. They fell in love and married on March 7	 1940. It lasted until Babe's death in 1957."	1.0

After reading a few comments about the character Doc Savage and the comic series	 I knew this film was not meant to be ironic. So	 the story tells us about an US-American Super-Doc saving a south American republic from evil. Sounds like a typical story. But this one comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous. The mandatory end-fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts I have ever seen. The film might be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example."	0.0
I saw this in the summer of 1990. I'm still annoyed by how bad this movie is in 2001.<br /><br />Implausible plot. You'd have to be a child to think this could happen.<br /><br />I'm just really annoyed by it. Don't see this.	0.0
"Many of the reviews and comments I have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by Clara Bow. Although the story-line was rather typical of Clara's later silents	 I still find it somewhat heart-stirring and incredibly fun. Clara plays a happy-go-lucky Hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves...never mind that this man is married! Clara's lack of modesty was shocking in the day	 but I believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie. Though definitely not a brilliant story-line (quite typical	 actually)	 this movie is a nice showcase of Clara's ability to make the audience laugh."	1.0
"The buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Sadly	 they stopped there. They should have continued to make the script disappear	 then the silly set	 and finally every visible element of this film. Because	 there's nothing else there to show.<br /><br />Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film. I don't really think they exist. I think they bought this script at ""Scripts-R-Us""	 where you buy a standard blank ""Monster Movie"" script and just fill in the blanks. There's a monster stalking us. Let's split up. (They actually ""let's split up"" in this movie). Hit Alien/Giant-bug/Monster/Invisible-man with crowbar. Not dead yet. Burn Huge-rabbit/Shark/Invisible-man in unsurvivable fire. Not dead yet. You know	 the standard stuff. Even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie (IR glasses	 spraying with something like paint) were handled badly. <br /><br />What is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie. They psychological issues for the subject	 the deterioration of the mind due to the process	 treating an invisible subject	 and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been far more interesting. Had there been any desire to save Kevin Bacon in the end	 it would have been a much better movie. All in all	 it stunk.<br /><br />I would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie	 but I don't want to do any spoilers. Suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they don't think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than..."	0.0
"A quite good film version of the novel	 though at the beginning a little bit lengthy. Fortunately there are a few funny scenes from time to time. This movie is surely not for the main stream audience - but for fans of Italian (or Portuguese) cinema	 a must-see also for Mastroianni-fans."	1.0

When I first saw this movie	 I did'nt immediately realise that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey but their talent in acting and writing came out as quite impressive. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they were really Matt and Trey	 later on. The humor is sometimes crude	 sometimes foul	 sometimes brilliant	 sometimes subtle	 sometimes loud and sometimes stupid but overall	 this is one hell of a movie that is without doubt	 under rated.

"Can anybody do good CGI films besides Pixar? I mean really	 animation looked antiquated by 2006 standards and even by 1995 Toy Story standards. Or maybe they spent all their budget on Hugh Jackman.

But then the sewer mimicked the ways of London - to an extent. Throw in a promise of jewels (????) and an evil(??) frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainment.<br /><br />I would like to say something entertained me. Maybe the hookup in the movie? Or maybe the happily-ever-after rat relationship. But nothing did. It had the talent	 but it blew up. D-"	0.0
The Rookie kept me smiling from beginning to end. Dennis Quaid played the role to perfection. The little boy that plays his son was fantastic. He made this a father-son movie to remember. The messages are good ones. Follow your dreams. Failing at the pursuit is alright as long as you try. The excitement is palpable. I believe this movie will be a classic.	1.0
"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare starts as dream demon Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) leaves a teenager (Shon Greenblatt) on the outskirt's of Springwood with no memory of himself	 who he is or why he is there. The local police pick him up & take him to a youth centre where child psychiatrist Maggie Burroughs (Lisa Zane) interviews him	 she finds a newspaper cutting in his pocket which leads the two to Elm Street in Springwood where they discover that no children live there & therefore no victims for Freddy kill anyone. It all turns out that it's an elaborate plan by Freddy to find his daughter & use her to escape Springwood. When Maggie realises what Freddy is up to her & some kids decide they have to kill Freddy once & for all...<br /><br />Directed by Rachel Talalay this was made with the intention of being the final A Nightmare on Elm Street film which by this time had reached five	 of course as any horror film fan know's if there's still money to be made from a franchise or a character then there's no way in hell Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare was going to be the last one which	 of course	 it wasn't. The A Nightmare on Elm Street series has been a franchise of diminishing returns as the films dropped in quality as the series progressed until we got here & Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare which for my money is probably the worst out of the lot of them. The film moves at a reasonable pace & it's rarely boring but it's so silly	 childish & feels like some sort of live-action cartoon with some awful set-piece horror scenes that seem a million miles from Wes Craven's suspenseful & effective early 80's original. The sequence where stoner Spencer is trapped inside a video game being played by Freddy is terrible on it's own but then we are treated to shots of his body back in reality bouncing around the house from wall to wall & floor to ceiling which is quite the most ridiculous thing I've seen in a while	 or maybe the early scenes when the John Doe kid falls from a plane down to the ground just like the Coyote cartoon character in the Road Runner cartoons or the absurd sight of Freddy threatening the deaf Carlos with pins that he intends to drop to the floor to make a loud noise or when he eventually kills him by scraping his knives across a blackboard. You can't take this seriously & I was just sitting there not quite believing what I was seeing. When they do finally try to kill Freddy the hero is given a secret powerful special weapon	 yeah that's right a pair of cardboard 3-D glasses! The character's are poor	 the dialogue is poor & the plot is confusing	 it doesn't really stick to the Elm Street continuity & overall the film is a bit of a mess	 the best thing I can say about it is that it has quite a bit of unintentional humour & you can certainly laugh at it.<br /><br />The film has major tonal problems as it tries to be dark	 scary & sinister yet it's so silly & simply looks ridiculous at times that any attempt at being serious falls completely flat. There's not much gore in this one	 there's some cut off fingers	 some stabbings	 someone falls on a bed of nails & that's about it. The body count is extremely low here with only three death's. The final twenty or so minutes of Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare was in fact shot in 3-D although the version I saw presented this part as normal so I can't comment on how well this does or doesn't work but you can definitely see shots which are meant to be seen in 3-D which take advantage of the process. The special effects vary	 some are quite good actually while other's are terrible & Freddy's burnt make-up this time looks quite poor.<br /><br />This apparently had a budget of about $5	000	000 (it had an opening weekend box-office take of $12	000	000) & the film has a few nice visual touches & gags which makes the thing feel even more cartoony than it already is. The acting is really poor from the main leads although there are a few odd cameos including Tom Arnold & Roseanne	 Johnny Depp & rocker Alice Cooper.<br /><br />Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare is probably the worst of the entire series & apart from some unintentional laugh value there's not much here to recommend or enjoy. Fans of the series will probably like it & defend it but for me this is about as far from Wes Craven's original classic shocker as it gets. Followed by New Nightmare (1994) which tried to take Freddy Krueger & the series in a new & different direction."	0.0
"This movie has got to be one of the worst I have ever seen make it to DVD!!! The story line might have clicked if the film had more funding and writers that would have cut the nonsense and sickly scenes that I highly caution parents on.... But the story line is like a loose cannon. If there was such a thing as a drive thru movie maker-this one would have sprung from that.It reminded me a lot of the quickie films that were put out in the 1960's	 poor script writing and filming. <br /><br />The only sensible characters in the whole movie was the bartender and beaver. The rest of the film	 could have easily been made by middle school children. I give this film a rating of 1 as it is truly awful and left my entire family with a sense of being cheated. My advice-Don't Watch It!!!"	0.0
"You sit there for a half an hour and watch a story	 believing it all	 then watch another half an hour of the same story utterly unraveling... and then put back together again. Brilliant.<br /><br />One of the most exciting feature films at the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary. I don't know if - other than Andrew Jarecki's ""Capturing the Friedmans"" - there has ever been anything like Anna Broinowski's ""Forbidden Lie$."" It features	 exposes	 defends	 reveals	 and questions everything about Norma Khouri	 author of ""Honor Lost	"" the acclaimed and lambasted 2001 bestseller about honor killings in Jordan.<br /><br />What is quite incredible and what makes the film so exceptional is that this ""exposure"" of Khouri is made with Khouri's full participation.<br /><br />For the initial portion of the film	 Khouri presents her story about the supposed honor killing of a friend of hers in Amman	 the story of the book. She sounds completely believable	 convincing.<br /><br />Then her story is taken apart	 exposed	 by eminently believable and convincing people	 such as women's rights activists in Jordan	 investigative reporters there and in Australia	 where Khouri lived for a while.<br /><br />Khouri comes back and denies the accusations	 taking a successful lie-detector test in the process. There comes another segment of devastating exposures - not to be specified here because that would lessen the shock value... and then Khouri comes back and faces the accusations (not all	 but the essential ones in the matter of the book).<br /><br />And the Houdini act continues	 with round after round in this heavy-weight	 seesaw prize fight	 surprise after surprise - and there is no ""happy ending"" in the sense of resolution. Brilliant."	1.0
"""Panic"" is a captivating	 blurred-genre film about a brooding and conflicted middle aged hitman's reconciliation of infatuation with a younger uninhibited hairstylist	 his love of wife and son	 his duty to his employer/father with his own identity.

The characters' clarity and sincerity in such an improbable story may both fascinate and annoy audiences."	1.0
"People criticise Disney's animated features of the 1950s for being overly glossy	 set in landscapes that are much too pristine. That criticism is just. And yet it can't be the whole story	 because the two least glossy - ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Peter Pan"" - are also the weakest. ""Cinderella""	 on the other hand	 set in a world in which the very dirt sparkles	 is clearly the best.<br /><br />It DOES look good. The backgrounds are subtle and consistent; the colours are pure without being too bright. The animation varies a bit. I'll swear that some of the humans are rotoscoped - but then	 the rotoscoped humans (including Cinderella herself) aren't full-blooded characters in the script	 so this approach works well enough. It's really the animals that make the movie. I think the studio had never quite used animals in this way before	 as totems rather than sidekicks. The mice	 for instance	 are the creatures who draw us into the story; but they are really representatives or allies of the more colourless Cinderella. The cat	 Lucifer	 is a kind of witch's familiar to the Wicked Stepmother. (The cat is brilliantly conceived and animated - one of the best feline creations of all time. The supervising animator was Ward Kimball and he modelled it on his own cat. I wonder how he put up with the animal.) This approach allows the animals to steal the show without drawing our attention from the main story. Their actions are of maximum interest only in the light of the main story.<br /><br />Among the supporting cast the notable humans are the King and the Grand Duke. The King is a one note character - he wants grandchildren and appears to have no other desires at all - but the note is struck in a pleasing fashion. The Grand Duke is a put-upon character who deserves to be lifted out of his sphere as much as Cinderella does. (Although he	 of course	 is richer.)<br /><br />""Cinderella"" is Disney's return to features after an eight-year hiatus	 and neither with it nor with any subsequent movie would he recapture the raw brilliance of his early years. Moreover he made things hard for himself by picking ""Cinderella"". She's a passive heroine and there's not much anyone can do about that. (Maybe I'm wrong on this score - I haven't seen the recent ""Ever After"".) Nonetheless it is remarkable how successful Disney was in bringing this unpromising story to life	 without cutting across the grain of its spirit."	1.0
Excellent writing and wild cast. The tech is poor but it's obviously very low budget. Looks like they didn't cut the negative but had to release on a video output. In any case one of the most inventive comedies I've seen lately. The screenwriter in particular is fine.	1.0
"Please note that I haven't seen the film since I discovered it in 2007	 and my town is smaller and doesn't carry it. However	 I really want to say something about it. I'm actually doing research for university on the title character Richard Maurice Bucke and would like to point out that the person they based the main character on was in reality completely different!!! Hollywood's ideas of people and artistic license granted	 the real Dr. Bucke totally endorsed hysterectomies to cure insanity in women	 and would never have practiced anything as liberal as represented in the film. I think it's laughable to see various film critics who write for legitimate newspapers who say this film has some historical basis! The only actual fact I can see is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman. Please don't waste your time on a film with such a disregard to the horror that real women experienced at the hands of this doctor who has now been glorified by the film industry."	0.0
"This is a great movie	 I did the play a while ago. It had an extra zing-- to it. I loved Vanessa Williams as Rosey	 and also Jason Alexander has a good voice. It was great.

"Two snipers travel deep in the jungles in search for their targets; a slimy South American drug-lord and a prominent general.<br /><br />Moderately successful at building a brooding atmosphere	 Sniper is by most accounts a very solid thriller	 taking it's time	 establishing it's characters and their plight and climaxing in some good action sequences. Director Llosa isn't always successful at maintaining the sombre mood and could have tightened the story somewhat; some detours here don't add up to much. But this film is far better than his Stallone/Stone travesty The Specialist.<br /><br />Billy Zane	 usually incredibly tiresome	 does surprisingly well as the inexperienced Sniper teamed up with veteran Berenger. As for Berenger this film proved to be his last good big budget Hollywood venture. He can do these kind of roles in his sleep and he's very convincing here	 reprising the role twice more in direct to DVD sequels."	1.0
"Part of the enjoyment that I took from this film stemmed from the fact that I knew nothing more about it than that it starred John Turturro and Emily Watson (2 reasons enough to watch)	 was a period piece and involved chess. Everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected. I shan't	 therefore	 give away much more. Suffice to say that Turturro is magnificent as an eccentric	 obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and Em matches him step for step as the strong-minded woman who is drawn to him. It's about love and obsession	 rather than the venerated board game and after drawing me in gradually over the first half hour	 became totally compelling. And I defy anyone to second-guess the ending."	1.0
"First of all	 let me say the I am LDS or rather	 I am a Mormon. So when I watched this film	 I automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt. I can usually find something redeeming in every movie I watch. And this one was no exception. It does have its redeeming moments. But they are few and far between.<br /><br />One of the first things I noticed that bothered me very greatly was that it seemed as though Halestorm was ashamed of our Church! In the LDS Church	 congregations are called ""wards"" and the basketball court is in the ""cultural hall"". NEVER ONCE are either of these two names mentioned. The Church is never referred to by name and ""the standards"" is as far as it goes in mentioning what our Church believes.<br /><br />It makes me wonder if the directors are really LDS or LDS wannabes? This film had so much potential! It could have really shown our Church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer	 but also what we believe. Instead it was only mildly entertaining and left much to be desired. If I were not already LDS	 I'd be left thinking Mormons are stupid	 idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs.<br /><br />It is NOT a film I will recommend to my nonLDS friends.<br /><br />Sorry Halestorm. You can do better than this!"	0.0
the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people.presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart.a rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions.the movie re affirms your faith in love and pain of separation. the joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled and anything can be sacrificed. Ethan and Julie have essayed eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the movie a sheer joy and love to watch. A must see movie for all the people who believe in true love. by far the most romantic(at least one of them) movie of all times.	1.0
"I must agree with the very first comment: this movie sucks very	 very hard. Despite having a very big B-list cast	 the cover of this film (for those who aren't watching it on Comedy Central during a weekday which is probably the only exposure this film will ever get) tries to put the blame on Dangerfield but in reality is just a paycheck for every has-been comedian from the '80s. Randy Quaid? Check. Ed Begley	 Jr? Check. The voice of Lisa Simpson? She can now say that Maximum Overdrive wasn't her only horrible flick: double check. And so many	 many others.<br /><br />The saddest thing about this flick is that it was so lazily written with already-told jokes. Nothing about this movie outside of its existence is funny. You're better off watching paint dry. This is definitely direct-to-video scraping-the-bottom-of-the-barrel stuff that still believes in the old video adage: throw an old-time star on the cover and you'll get some money back off of the rental. Considering the days of video rental are changing	 consider this one of the last examples of putting out garbage.<br /><br />The only use this movie has if you're having trouble falling asleep. It'll get you there."	0.0
"Without ""mental anachronism""	 this film which I would like to find in DVD offer an extraordinary diving in the vital and mental context of thought of the people before the ""disenchantment of the world"". That	 there is thirty years	 a director and a scenario writer could test one such empathy and such a romantic truth to do it of them masterpiece leaves me astounding. It would be necessary to be able to see and re-examine it film for better seizing than the temporal and cultural distance us to make lose of capacity to be included/understood	 analyze and finally to accept of such or such example of ""primitive thought"". Because this thought maintaining almost impossible to feel in the secularized world however contain certain keys of our behavior	 that only them future generations will be able to analyze with sufficient relevance.

"I grew up in Houston and was nine when this movie came out. As a result I don't remember anything about the movie. But I do remember the sensation it caused from Gilley's and the mechanical bull to Johnny Lee's hit song ""Lookin' for Love"" which still brings back memories of childhood whenever I hear it.<br /><br />However	 a few years ago I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all I can say is	 I was blown away. Few movies have hit me harder. This movie is as raw and real as you can get. From Uncle Bob's ranch house	 the chemical plant in Texas City	 Gilley's dance hall	 and Bud and Sissy. And maybe for that reason it doesn't have a wider appeal. But no matter how you feel about country music (I for one can't stand it despite my Houston roots) Urban Cowboy is a unique slice of American pie. For that reason I love it!"	1.0
"Sadly	 it's true. ""Legiunea sträinä"" exposes with absolute clarity the parameters of Daneliuc's irreversible failure.<br /><br />As it was already said	 the author lost the faculty to coalesce his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form. Maniacally concerned with the mechanic trick of picking at random news subjects and join them together without any legitimacy	 he only gathers a disordered pile of events	 unable to follow the least story-line. The script's level is similar to a ""Cântarea României"" amateur play about the glorious feats of socialist realism - only	 turned upside down: while the communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sugary festivism	 now Daneliuc is as perniciously obsessed only with negativism and disgusting scatology. The ideas content is zero	 and the ""message""	 infantile and didactic	 at a kindergarten level.<br /><br />Unfortunately	 he also forgot the most elementary professional tenets. He isn't able anymore to organize a dramatic situation	 to order it in a correct movie scene	 to frame it right and to edit it following the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar. His level of story-telling in film-images is similar to phrasing something like: ""Holy sheet man it ain't nuthin right 'ere	 and all da people is asses!"" What a huge distance from the impressive artist of 1976-1984	 who had created unique works as ""Cursa""	 ""Proba de microfon""	 ""Vânätoarea de vulpi"" - and even ""Croaziera"" and ""Glissando""...

However	 don't expect this to be a movie about the revolution	 it's political stance is wonderfully ambiguous.

"Terrible film made on a budget of about $9.99. Very obvious miniature sets used	 poor acting and an awful storyline concerning aliens who use discarded meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship. The film contains some blood (not enough to disturb) and a character with an eggbeater replacing one of his hands. (Yes you read that correctly.)<br /><br />One saving grace was a song performed at the ""talent show"" (how's that for irony?) by a punk/new wave band that I think was called ""I'm A Heat Seeking Missile"".

Josie Lawrence	 who is best known as a comedienne	 really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes. Even the men in this film go from being self-centered to better men.

"From very long	 we are seeing movies on Gandhi. And mostly	 the light is always on portrayal of Gandhi as freedom fighter or man with principles. But when I heard that a movie is being made which will highlight Gandhi as Father and stress on his relationship with his Son	 it instantly hit my attention as this is one territory which is least being explored as it has his own dark side and less people shown courage to dwell into it. Fortunetly	 Anil Kapoor (Producer) and Feroz Abbad Khan (Director) did.<br /><br />The story start with Gandhi working in South Africa and his relationship with white people and his wife. Latter Akshay (Harilal) joined his father for becoming a barrister but his dream took overturn when his father (Gandhi) pushed (Or motivate) him to become freedom fighter. It showcase that Gandhi believes more on practical study rather then formal education. Harilal too try to walk on his father footstep but soon failed as its infatuation towards his wife	 children and his own dream of becoming big success altered his path and then start the repulsion between son and father. He finally defeated his father in terms of pursuing his dream and to left him on his own terms. He written back to India but then start his unsuccessful stories which become bigger and bigger with time. I am leaving reader to see movie to catch further story...<br /><br />Performance. First Akshay. He has given best performance of his tenure so far and is absolutely convincing in his portrayal as Harilal Gandhi. The scene in which he reach the room where his wife dead body is placed is one where you can see a fine actor which is hidden/developing in Akshay. Darshan jariwala is also good as MK Gandhi and able to live up such a larger then life character. He performed well and with quite an ease. Shefali Chaya (Now Shah) as Kasturba is brilliant actress and already proved her metal in TV serials. Bhumika chawla too performed well but actress of her candidature is waste in these kinds of role. Other actor have also justifies their performances.<br /><br />Technique and Make up is also good and cinematography especially that Duo tone color picturisation was too good. Costume looks and match with context.<br /><br />Overall	 a worth seeing movie which is defiantly slow in progress and impatient people may find it boring but give you an insight of area which is not brought to silver screen till date. Also	 the way story progress and connection of scene may look worn to some people and to critics especially but for an average movie watcher like me	 it still enough to make me occupied on my seat till end."	1.0
"Having enjoyed Joyce's complex novel so keenly I was prepared to be disappointed by Joseph Strick's and Fred Haines's screenplay	 given the fabulous complexity of the original text. However	 the film turned out to be very well done and a fine translation of the tone	 naturalism	 and levity of the book.<br /><br />It certainly helps to have read the original text before viewing the film. I imagine the latter would seem disjointed	 with very odd episodes apparently randomly stitched together	 without a prior reading of the text to help grasp the plot.<br /><br />It's amazing to see how ""filthy"" the film is	 given that it was shot in Dublin in 1967. The Irish film censors only	 finally	 unbanned it for viewing by general audiences in Ireland as late as 2000 (it was shown to restricted audiences in a private cinema club	 the Irish Film Theatre	 in the late 1970s). Joyce's eroticism is not simply naturalistic and raunchy	 it offers many wildly ""perverse"" episodes. Never mind that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 - they were still utterly taboo when the film was made in 1967.<br /><br />It is astonishing and heartening to watch the cream of the Irish acting profession of the 1960s	 respected players all	 daring to utter and enact Joyce's hugely transgressive text with such gusto.<br /><br />Bravo!"	1.0
"Perhaps I'm not a sophisticate. This and Closer are two of the more supposedly cerebral films I've seen recently	 and both suffer from exactly the same problem to an excruciating extent. The dialogue is false false false. Nothing that comes out of anyone's mouth seems remotely believable. Perhaps the way this film is set up that's the way it's supposed to feel	 but it was unwatchable. And boring. I walked out after 20 minutes of tedium.<br /><br />I'll stick with Sleeper and Bananas for my Woody Allen fix. If I ever come across this on the teevee	 I'll turn over and try to find an episode of Quincy instead."	0.0
"This self proclaimed ""very talented artist"" have directed easily the worst Spanish film of the 21st century. Lack of emotion	 coherence	 rhythm	 skills	 humor... it repeats the same situation over and over again. It shows no character development. It does not even show any violent and/or sexual content	 and it does not add anything new to the psycho-killer sub genre. So lame it should be shown at film schools as an example of ""what not to do"" in a first movie.<br /><br />BTW where the hell is the ""talent""? there are scenes which have been shot almost identically; there are scenes which have two or more master shots and it is quite awful to see the action jumping from one master shot to another without a reason. The camera almost never moves	 as if the ""very talented artist"" was afraid of showing his lack of visual skills. The actors playing the main roles act like amateurs	 and the supporting cast is hardly believable.

The Leap Years tells the destiny-filled tale of Li-Ann who falls for the suave Jeremy and they commit to meet every leap year. A very romantic premise	 based on a great short story and with a cast that doesn't feel like you're watching yet another Jack Neo flick. Then why oh why is it so bad? Firstly	 I feel the filmmakers thought they were shooting a music video	 because they chose to replace storytelling and any true emotions with cheesy montages	 predictable actions and clichéd lines. I am both upset and embarrassed to have been one of the first few in Singapore to watch The Leap Years	 but those of us in the cinema would agree that our muffled groans at the cringe-worthy performances spoke volumes. My hope was to watch a romantic movie that would surpass Forever Fever	 the best Singaporean romantic comedy so far	 and The Leap Years does not even come close. Some blogs have called it The Crap Years which is harsh but ultimately true. Don't waste your money or your emotions like I did. The movie will make you give up on love forever."	0.0
"The beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother's love	 the exceptional performances	 the steady execution and the quite innovative script. The film tells the story of an Indian woman	 Nandini	 who lives in Canada with her husband Shekhar and little kid Raja. All of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in India (of whom she had not even known) is in troubles and the couple rush to India. When they get into the village	 Nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture; Shekhar's family	 ruled by his cruel	 highly cynical and merciless father Narasimha	 lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless. Nandini starts nagging Shekhar to return home	 but he is soon killed by his father's enemies. When she wants to leave	 Narasimha refuses to let her take Raja back to India. Here starts the intense struggle which can be called ""Nandini vs. Narasimha"".<br /><br />India is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film	 but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas	 so it may be even correct. The portrayal is in my view fair and not one-sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent. Such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world. The locations are amazing	 the music is wonderful	 and Krishna Vamshi's direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing. One thing that must be noted is the very ear-pleasing background score by Ismail Darbar	 it is beautiful. The characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film. Portrayed realistically throughout	 the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch. Its dialogues are superb and intelligently written	 and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points	 a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension.<br /><br />The film's biggest strength is the performances. Karisma Kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as Nandini. Her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible. She displays so much intensity	 impulsiveness	 anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son. Her outbreaks while facing off Nana Patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child. After Fiza	 this is her most powerful performance. One of the greatest actors Indian cinema has seen	 Nana Patekar is indescribable as Narasimha. He manages to be hateful as Narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him. Patekar displays cruelty	 wittiness and even humanity with total conviction. He is outstanding. Another great performance comes unsurprisingly from India's most underrated actress	 Deepti Naval	 who sensitises her character to perfection. Sanjay Kapoor is just adequate and Shahrukh Khan provides great comic relief. Anyway	 do watch Shakti - it could have been better	 but it is definitely a must-watch."	1.0
"How can't you rate this movie with 10/10? I admit to say that this movie is not very entertaining but the goal is not to tell you a story but History! This is the first `real' movie of cinema history (`le Prince de Galles' was first but it was not technically perfect enough ) and it has an undoubtedly huge international value. These people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate to a historic moment	 becoming the first persons to be able to see themselves moving! And above all the shot is a beautiful shot! And it's very moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that! What a moment! Historic for science first (because the Lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographe for scientific reasons) and for art later. A movie to venerate!"	1.0

"Diagnosis Murder has been shown on most Weekday afternoons on BBC1 since I used to watch it while ill from School a good 10 years ago - I know I shouldn't really enjoy it	 in the same way I shouldn't enjoy 'Murder she Wrote' but I'm totally addicted to both and even have the DVD box-sets....OK I know that's sad!<br /><br />Dick Van Dyke carries the show as he stars as Dr.Mark Sloan a Doctor at Community General Hospital in L.A who is also a Police consultant for the L.A.P.D. - his son Steve (Barry van Dyke - Dick's real life son) is a Police Officer	 who needs his father's help on very many Suspicious deaths. <br /><br />Along for the ride is Dr.Amanda Bentley (Victoria Bentley) the resident Pathologist at Community General and for the first couple of seasons you had Scott Baio playing Dr.Jack Stewart	 who upped and left the series in 1995 hoping to go on to bigger and better things...he should have stayed where he was	 he hasn't done anything of note since....and his only theatrical appearance for many years was in Baby Geniuses 2:Superbabies....Oh Dear!!!<br /><br />anyhow Dr.Jack Stewart was replaced by the younger Dr.Jesse Travis played by Charlie Schlatter who stepped into Baio's shoes pretty comfortably.<br /><br />The series is highly implausible but what Whodunit series isn't? (Murder she wrote - everywhere Jessica goes	 someone ends up dead	 or The underrated Father Dowling Mysteries about a Murder solving Priest with nun sidekick)<br /><br />The series was much lighter up until 1997 this is because it had a supporting cast that included the bumbling Hospital Manager Norman Briggs played by Michael Tucci along with Nurse & Mark's secretary Dolores played by Delores Hall	 After 1997 both these characters were no longer included and the series became a grittier affair with a bigger looking budget	 some episodes included far more action	 one episode the entire Hospital is blown up.<br /><br />This was a family show For the Van Dyke's because as well as Dick's Son Barry	 you also had Dick's Daughter And all his Grandchildren making an appearance in various episodes. <br /><br />As the series went on it got a bit silly	 one episode I remember Dick van Dike plays his entire family	 which was a bit out of the ordinary	 but on the Whole 'Diagnosis Murder' was a really good TV show which had numerous good Guest Stars.<br /><br />Since this show finished in 2001	 Dick & Barry have appeared together again in the 'MURDER 101' series of TV Movies made by The Hallmark Channel	 pretty much following the same path	 and still enjoyable. Dick who's now in his mid 80's doesn't seem to change a great deal	 and looks as if he'll be working till the bitter end.<br /><br />TV SHOW **** OUT OF *****"	1.0
"This film is like an allegory of the gospel. It has such direct honesty and innocence you can not possibly believe it was made after the world war when Italy was ravaged and devastated	 and was filled with a huge homeless	 impoverished population. It is a monument to the best qualities of the human spirit	 as well as to the endless creative resources of that land of inspiration. <br /><br />Toto is a character like Doestoevisky's ""Idiot""	 a modern Christ finding his way in a big city. He is goodness and purity fortified by love	 and his acts change the people he encounters	 as much as the miracle working dove. The story is told in a natural manner and simple style	 yet imbued with a magic that is almost a premonition of Fellini's surrealist fantasies. It is one of the most inspiring	 uplifting movies ever made."	1.0
"I caught the last half of this movie on cable one night and was struck by just how morbid it was. Even when one of the two victims is at his most deteriorated	 the camera keeps going. the lingering shots of his corpse being uncovered and his concentration-camp figure being zipped into a body bag are both moving and depressing. don't watch this movie if your already depressed. then again don't watch it if your feeling really good."	1.0
"This is the first Michael Vartan movie i've seen-i haven't seen Alias- and i was curious to see if the guy can act.He sure can and is likable in this movie.Natasha Henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles	so i found her very good and lovable in this different""sweet"" role of a schoolteacher. Some of the negative comments i read are true	the movie is full of clichés and the story doesn't ring true at all.Also	even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together	i don't think there is screen chemistry there. However	i enjoyed this movie.The locales are nice	the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good. If you are expecting to see a great romance	this is not it.But if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good."	1.0
"I loved this episode. It is so great that all 5 of them team up and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also love this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen/Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen/Green Arrow) are guest starring in it!!! I just hope that Clark will join the Justice League and we'll get to follow this group of heroes across the globe!! =)It was really exciting and keeps viewers interested because of what will happen next. I think Chloe should also join the team as Watchtower	 that would be such a coool thing for her to do besides the Daily Planet because she doesn't have super powers. Also	 I want to find out what types of subjects Lex is going to use for 33.1	 I wonder what other types of powers other people in the world have!!!"	1.0
"This was a disappointment - none of the nuance of the original. The Brits just seem to be able to make a truly unsettling film with none of the over-the-top histrionics of the American version. The original series combined both creepy stories and subtlety of performance with great attention to lighting and settings. I have watched the series many times and am still enthralled.<br /><br />Just another poor adaptation along the lines of the dreadful adaptation of ""Cracker"". Get hooked up with BBC America or BBC Canada and watch for such delights as Waking the Dead	 Spooks	 Silent Witness	 and Judge John Deed. Watch the original Touching Evil	 then look for ""Wire in the Blood"" for more of the truly understated	 elegant performance of Robson Green. Hollywood needs to have a look at this actor!"	0.0
"There isn't one decent scene.<br /><br />Amy Adams gives one of the worst performances of all time. Proof that you a can start anywhere. The guy playing Sebastian sucks	 too. He doesn't even look much like Ryan Phillipe. More like Joshua Jackson. The two other girls are terrible	 as well. <br /><br />Then the dialogue is also crap.<br /><br />Sebastian (About to have threesome): If you cant beat them... <br /><br />Virgin Girl: Who says you can't beat 'em?<br /><br />Lame.<br /><br />The ending contradicts the entire plot of the original. In the first film	 it is clearly stated that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons Sebastian wanted Kathryn so bad	 aside from the fact that she's played by Sarah Michelle Gellar	 was that she was ""the only girl he couldn't have and it killed him"". She was a tease who liked playing with him. The fact that she never gave it to him increased his wanting. Then in this P.O.S.	 it implies that he CAN have her	 along with a girl on the side. What? And we don't even see the sex	 either. It's implied	 making it not only stupid	 pointless	 and contradictory	 but worthless too.<br /><br />And in the first one	 Kathryn rejects Sebastian because he fell in love	 making him a loser. Even though he won the bet	 that crumbled his chances. Then in this excrement	 he looses AND falls in love. So she doesn't screw ""losers""	 only complete losers? Another thing: it's stated that Sebastian has never been in love	 so what do you call the thing with Virgin Girl?<br /><br />Then at the end	 virgin girl is all of sudden revealed to be Kathryn's evil lesbian lover (dun dun dun) and	 like I said	 they go into a lame offscreen threesome. Stupid. <br /><br />There's several other plot contradictions. Did the writer even see the first film? A 5 year old can point his stuff out.<br /><br />After the threesome	 Sebastian has sex with the blonde virgin	 corrupting her innocent mind in the back of a limo while Kathryn and Virgin Girl Turned Evil Lesbian In Lame Sudden Plot Twist sit in the front	 listen	 and smile evilly into the camera. <br /><br />The end... <br /><br />Seeing Sebastian become the ass hole he was in the first one could have made an interesting film. I guess all it took to make little Sebastian bad was a threesome with two hot girls. Interesting."	0.0
"This was recently on AMC's vibrant movie classics and I had to laugh. I had high hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of ""Voyage to the Earth's Core"" and ""Mysterious Island"". I was sorely disappointed not only in the acting credentials but in the silly story line that reads from a five year old's comic book. Be sure to catch sight of the wires that are holding on to the Pterdactyl's wings when they grasp ""Ogar"" a half idiot pre-modern man who befriends the lost adventurers. The ending left it open for further rehashing of the same effects in ""People that Time Forgot"". Don't waste your time."	0.0
"This was a better than average movie I thought	 for it being on cable. I had expected something along the lines of cheesy melodrama and bad special effects seen in such classics as Christmas Rush or First Daughter/Target/Shot	 etc.<br /><br />The cast was well chosen...I especially liked Ron Livingston as the hard pressed SWAT Commander. It's good to see him revisiting the same material he had so much fortune with in Band of Brothers. The producers and designers had done their homework because all the scenes and shots looked like they did on that day back in 1997.<br /><br />So	 if you get a chance to see this film	 and I am sure you will since FX reruns everything 50 times...take 2 hours and enjoy it."	0.0
"Jeff Wincott is not only a Hunk	 he can kick butt! This movie has some of the best Martial arts moves I've seen in a very long time. Ok	 so maybe Bridgette Nielson isn't the first person I'd hire to play a ruthless politician	 she did a GREAT job nontheless! And let's not forget that Wincott has a partner in this movie played by Martial arts expert/stuntwoman Karen Sheperd. So she's not Cynthia Rothrock	 Who CARES?! She's just as good	 if not BETTER! (just check out her fight scene at the end of the movie	 one word: OUCH!!). My suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible	 because if you haven't seen it	 you're really missing out on some great martial arts action."	1.0

"When I first saw a glimpse of this movie	 I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy	 the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball	 but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin	 nothing is similar in any way-her expression	 voice	 or movement.<br /><br />To top it all off	 Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny	 his accent is unreal	 and once again	 his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either	 they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky.<br /><br />Overall	 extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball	 I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi	 read the book from Lucille Ball herself	 or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama	 ""Before the Laughter"" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in ""Before the Laughter"" is much better compared to this. At least	 a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing."	0.0
"Having just recently re-viewed ""Lipstick"" for the first time in a few decades	 I backed it with ""Descent"" even though I have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mine.<br /><br />It's interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the Rape Revenge movie has evolved in the past 32 years	 from the full-on gore of ""I Spit On Your Grave	"" to the tawdry sensationalism of ""Lipstick	"" to the tasteful handling of the issue in ""The Accused."" But ""Descent	"" though making some important points	 never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning. No	 ""Descent"" is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make --- a message that	 when examined closely	 isn't that groundbreaking.<br /><br />I pretty much knew the plot going in. What I wanted to see *was* the ""descent"" or degeneration of Dawson's character. Being a big fan of Rosario's	 I was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted...you know	 the kind of portrayal DeNiro brings to ""Taxi Driver."" Unfortunately	 the script and the director/writer's choices don't provide any sort of believable transition.<br /><br />The biggest point of failure is the second act. It became obvious what the filmmaker's intentions were for this segment of club-hopping	 drug use	 and obsession with big black stallion Adrian (every white boy's nightmare	 natch) from a Q&A on the DVD	 but this excursion into Dawson's character is never believably rendered. We don't know exactly what the hell she's doing half the time	 what she's after	 or why she's doing it. The poor quality of the audio/video again don't help	 but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless. It destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well-done first act. By the time we get to the finale	 our interest has already waned.<br /><br />One point of success that Dawson does point out in the Q&A is that by the end ""revenge"" scene we are pumped for retribution	 then realize just how drawn-out and ugly the reality is. While that's certainly valid	 it doesn't make the scene any more intriguing.<br /><br />If you have the DVD	 check out the deleted ""classroom"" scene. This is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation (though all verbal) and really DOES show Dawson's slow crack-up materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor Francie Swift's prissy	 condescending dorm counselor. If more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down	 we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence.<br /><br />As the film stands in the final cut	 though	 all we get is what we've seen before	 only in a more graphic rendering. So what?"	0.0
"First love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema : the all-encompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or	 worse	 slightly ridiculous.<br /><br />Lifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and delivers a moving	 sexy	 thoroughly engrossing tale of love	 disaster and possible redemption	 while tangentially touching on some of the deeper themes in human existence.<br /><br />The core story is of Mathieu	 18	 a solitary	 introverted boy who meets Cédric	 brasher	 more outgoing but just as lonely	 while on holiday with his family. As the summer warms on	 they fall in love and	 when the holidays end	 decide to live together. A year later	 the relationship ends in catastrophe: Cédric cheats on Mathieu who	 distraught	 tries to take his own life. He survives and	 in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the seaside town where they first met	 this time cloaked in the chill of winter.<br /><br />If the tale was told like this it would never have the impact it does: much of it is implied	 all of it happens non-sequentially.<br /><br />The intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced	 through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective. Fortunately	 the three time-lines used (the summer of love	 the post-suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction) are colour coded: warm yellows and oranges for the summer	 an almost frighteningly chill blue for the hospital scenes and warming browns and blues for the winter seaside.<br /><br />Both main actors put in excellent performances though	 whilst it's a delight to see Stéphane Rideau (Cédric) used to his full capacity (I'm more used to seeing him under-stretched in Gael Morel's rather limp dramas)	 Jérémie Elkaim (Mathieu) has to be singled out for special mention: you can feel his loneliness	 then his almost incredulous passion	 then his character crumbling behind a wall of aphasia. Beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever could.<br /><br />The themes touched upon are almost classic in French cinema: our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling; our difficulty in communicating fully; the shifting sands of meaning The film's title ""Presque rien"" (Almost Nothing) points to all of these and	 indeed	 to one of the key scenes in the film: In trying to understand why Mathieu attempted to kill himself	 a psychiatrist asks Cédric if he had ever cheated on him ""Non enfin	 oui une fois	 mais ce n'était rien"" (No well	 yes once	 but it was nothing). Cédric still loves Mathieu  he brought him to the hospital during the suicide attempt (none of which we see) and tries desperately to contact him again once he leaves  but cannot understand that he has lost him forever	 because something that seemed nothing to him (a meaningless affair) is everything to Mathieu.<br /><br />Whilst the film is darker than the rather unfortunate Pierre et Gilles poster would suggest	 it is not without hope: we get to see Cédric's slow	 painful attempts to get back in touch with life	 first through a cat he adopts	 then through work in a local bar and finally contact with Pierre	 who may be his next love. But here the story ends: A teenage passion	 over within the year	 another perhaps beginning. So what was it? Almost Nothing? Certainly not when you're living it"	1.0
"Most people miss Hollywood's point of concept. If a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child	 within the confines of the law then I	 approve of the lessons being taught by Doc Savage.<br /><br />In all times of conflict or war	 the public and government look for heroes to decorate.

"Visually speaking	 this film is stunning. It has some delightful black comedic moments. But on the whole	 the plot is very clichéd	 as is its seeming message.

"This film is an excellent military movie. It may not be an excellent Hollywood Movie	 but that does not matter. Hollywood has a reputation of sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment	 but that is not the case with this movie. Other reviewers have found this movie to be too slow for their taste	 but  as a retired Soldier  I appreciate the pace the movie crew deliberately took to tell their story as completely as possible given the two hours and nine minutes allotted. The story itself has been told and retold several times over	 but it remains for a professional soldier  and an African American at that  to report on the story as presented by the movie crew	 and as it presents the US Navy to the world. The story of Brashear's work to become a Navy Diver	 and his life as a Navy Diver beyond his graduation	 is not the only story that is presented. There I also the story of how Master Chief Petty Officer Sunday defied the illegal order of his Commanding Officer that Petty Officer 2nd Class Brashear not be passed in his test dive no matter how well he did	 and paid the price of a loss of one Stripe and a change of assignment. It also told the true story how Brashear found the third Hydrogen Bombs lost in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Spain in the 1950's	 and how he saved the life of another seaman who was in the line of the snapped running line that would have snapped him in two if Brashear had not shoved him out of the way and took the shot himself. This was a complex story that was worth telling	 and I will admit that two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the full story	 and I can tell from the deleted scenes on the DVD that the crew tried their best to tell a story as full as possible. As a professional soldier	 I was proud to see such a great story told in such a comprehensive manner	 and to see the traditions and honor of the navy preserved in such a natural and full manner."	1.0
"Finally	 Timon and Pumbaa in their own film...<br /><br />'The Lion King 1 1/2: Hakuna Matata' is an irreverent new take on a classic tale. Which classic tale	 you ask? Why	 'The Lion King' of course!<br /><br />Yep	 if there's one thing that Disney is never short of	 it's narcissism.<br /><br />But that doesn't mean that this isn't a good film. It's basically the events of 'The Lion King' as told from Timon and Pumbaa's perspective. And it's because of this that you'll have to know the story of 'The Lion King' by heart to see where they're coming from.<br /><br />Anyway	 at one level I was watching this and thinking ""Oh my god this is so lame..."" and on another level I was having a ball. Much of the humour is predictable - I mean	 when Pumbaa makes up two beds	 a big one for himself and a small one for Timon	 within the first nanosecond we all know that Timon is going to take the big one. But that doesn't stop it from being hilarious	 which	 IMO	 is 'Hakuna Matata' in a nutshell. It's not what happens	 it's how.<br /><br />And a note of warning: there are also some fart jokes. Seriously	 did you expect anything else in a film where Pumbaa takes centre stage? But as fart jokes go	 these are especially good	 and should satisfy even the most particular connoisseur.<br /><br />The returning voice talent is great. I'm kinda surprised that some of the actors were willing to return	 what with most of them only having two or three lines (if they're lucky). Whoopi Goldberg is particularly welcome.<br /><br />The music is also great. From 'Digga Tunnah' at the start to 'That's all I need'	 an adaption of 'Warthog Rhapsody' (a song that was cut from 'The Lion King' and is frankly much improved in this incarnation)	 the music leaves me with nothing to complain about whatsoever.<br /><br />In the end	 Timon and Pumbaa are awesome characters	 and while it may be argued that 'Hakuna Matata' is simply an excuse to see them in various fun and assorted compromising situations then so be it. It's rare to find characters that you just want to spend time with.<br /><br />Am I starting to sound creepy?<br /><br />Either way	 'The Lion King 1 1/2' is great if you've seen 'The Lion King' far too many times. Especially if you are right now thinking ""Don't be silly	 there's no such thing as seeing 'The Lion King' too many times!"""	1.0
"This movie captures the absurd essence of an overbearing American patriot actor -- one that believes his work (and politics) are as crucial to the American people as the opinions of the President himself. Alan Bates captures this mindset perfectly as Michael Baytes	 and I will immortally remember Bates as this character. This is a movie for Canadians and Americans alike. It is a valuable piece of cinema	 that which is able to take its audience through the magic of making a film and reveal just how easy it is for the producer and director to lose complete control to the will of the actors and innumerable outside forces. Wonderfully	 ""Hollywood North"" does not suffer from the subject that it portrays: Peter O'Brian directs with precision and complete control	 and commands both the serious 'behind-the-scenes' portion of the movie	 and the movie-within-the-movie	 ""Flight to Bogota"" with clarity and insight. If you are at all interested in the wit and strength of Canadian cinema	 ""Hollywood North"" is a great place to start."	1.0
"How could I best express my feelings about this movie: hideous? a headache? lack of coherent writing? plain stupidity? Try all of the above for this travesty. And that just for the direction.<br /><br />Story? Well I guess there is a story. Two dumb blondes look for a job after they crash a plane into a golf course. They are mistaken for a 'world renounced assassin' (sarcasm) and are 'hired' by two 'mobsters'. One thinks ""taking him out"" means a date	 and the other gets the minor actor she dreams of. And of course	 the turtle reserve for the farting turtle	 that they build with the casino winnings.<br /><br />Sounds likes all this could be funny? Guess again. They try to make it funny	 but its not. Filming sequences aren't well done. I've seen better filming in Hong Kong movies. Visuals are average for a late 80s film. But the problem is that its a 2007 movie.<br /><br />Not worth my time to ever watch this again.

"Once upon a time some evil people made a movie about a guy that got shot into space	 supposedly to go to Saturn	 but really only to some stock footage of solar flares	 and then he gets a nose bleed	 and before you know it	 he's laying in a hospital bandaged head to foot	 and then an overweight nurse with an ill-fitting uniform comes in and gets eaten by the guy	 whose supposed to be melting all over the place but never seems to lose any mass	 and then NASA	 or at least one guy at NASA	 gets upset about it and calls one other guy in to hunt him down	 but the guy they sent to hunt the melting guy has to go home and have soup first	 and his oddly-shaped wife forgot the crackers	 so he can't have crackers	 and then he has to go out and look for the melting guy with a geiger counter	 and that doesn't really work	 so he really only follows the trail of half-eaten corpses	 and then there's something about a sheriff	 and two ugly old people in a lemon grove	 and a women with a meat cleaver	 and some kind of industrial plant with trigger-happy security guards	 and since I can't tell you how the movies ends	 all I can say is Jonathan Demme is in it somewhere with some guy with the stupid name of Burr DeBenning	 and if there's any justice in the world everyone connected with this movie died a hideous	 violent death and was unable to make more movies	 and the world lived HAPPILY EVER AFTER - THE END!"	0.0
"This film is pure Elvira and shows her at her breast... I mean best! The story (co-written by Cassandra Peterson	 Elvira's alter ego) is inspiring and captivating and is brought to life by Elvira's wit and charm. The viewer gets an opportunity to see Elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with the prejudices of the people of Fallwell	 Massachusetts (where she has travelled from Los Angeles in order to attend the reading of her Great Aunt Morganna's will) and at the same time tries to help the long-suffering teenagers who have been deprived of fun by the matriarchal Chastity Pariah and the rest of the town council. She also has to deal with her attraction to Bob Redding	 the owner of the local cinema	 and another woman (Patty) who has her eye on Bob as well but is not nearly as deserving of his love as Elvira. And	 later in the movie	 she also faces the complications of being descended from ''a major metaphysical celebrity'' and the charges of witchcraft brought against her which mean that she will be burnt at the stake. Elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable	 streetwise and naive in this film	 while cracking risque jokes and delivering off-beat lines with double meanings.<br /><br />This movie is inspiring because it gives out the message of never giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams. In the end Elvira's dreams finally come true	 which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman.<br /><br />I've seen this movie countless times and I never ever get tired of it! There are no unnecessary scenes and I found myself captivated throughout the whole movie. A review will not do justice to the actual movie	 so I can just tell you to PLEASE watch it because it is one of the best movies ever made! Meanwhile	 I wish you ''unpleasant dreams!''"	1.0
"I read one other review that expressed the view that Platoon was a never ending cycle of marines killing people	 being killed	 taking drugs and talking trash.<br /><br />I don't agree with that because the film actually had more to it	 but it a way	 I can see what this person is trying to say: this had no real plot - which is a point i agree with.<br /><br />It is self-indulgent Stone at his best. He really wanted to show	 not only how war leads to death	 but also how it is extremely traumatic on those who survive. Unfortunately	 the film seems to over ""glorify"" this aspect and the grand finale is just way too champagne	 grand-standing	 Oscar-hunting ""let's create an enduring image"" for my liking.<br /><br />The problem I have with Stone and other film-makers of his ilk is that they fail to understand this simply concept: depicting the terribly bloody deadly waste that war is DOES NOT PROVE OR EVEN REFLECT ON WHETHER it was an unjust or immoral war. We have seen the same thing emerge at the moment with Iraq. In case you're missing the point	 let me put it to you bluntly: if you saw how truly bloody the second world war was and how destructive it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers	 would you think it was an unjust war? If that fact alone doesn't convince you that it was an unjust war	 then why should depictions of the horrors of Vietnam convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that instance. <br /><br />Personally	 I do not support America's decision to go to war in Vietnam	 but i certainly don't subscribe to the ""this war is wrong because people died and suffered"" theory. I don't think that motivations are always wrong by default	 just because war in itself is terrible.<br /><br />This says nothing of the fact that the ending or the final big ""twist"" was a bit stupid. However	 this is not Stones first oddball departure. Wall street was a magnificent film	 up until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a dreadful ""wrong turn."" JFK is probably one of the few films Stone did that actually ended very well.<br /><br />But it hardly matters in this one because there was very little plot up until that point of the film to twist around. And this is why i gave it such a low mark. It was virtually story-less and ultimately boring - unless you fell for the manufactured poignancy."	0.0
"William Powell is a doctor dealing with a murder and an ex-wife in ""The Ex-Mrs. Bradford	"" also starring Jean Arthur	 Eric Blore	 and James Gleason. It seems that Powell had chemistry going with just about any woman with whom he was teamed. Though he and Myrna Loy were the perfect screen couple	 the actor made a couple of other ""Thin Man"" type movies	 one with Ginger Rogers and this one with Arthur	 both to very good effect.<br /><br />Somehow one never gets tired of seeing Powell as a witty	 debonair professional and ""The Ex-Mrs. Bradford"" is no exception. The ex-Mrs. B has Mr. B served with a subpoena for back alimony and then moves back in to help him solve a mystery that she's dragged him into. And this isn't the first time she's done that! It almost seems as though there was a ""Bradford"" film before this one or that this was intended to be the first of a series of films - Mr. B complains that his mystery-writer ex is constantly bringing him into cases. This time	 a jockey riding the favorite horse in a raise mysteriously falls off the horse and dies right before the finish line.<br /><br />The solution of the case is kind of outlandish but it's beside the point. The point is the banter between the couple and the interference of the ex-Mrs. B. Jean Arthur is quite glamorous in her role and very funny. However	 with an actress who comes off as brainy as Arthur does	 the humor seems intentional rather than featherbrained. I suspect the writer had something else in mind - say	 the wacky side of Carole Lombard. When Arthur hears that the police have arrived	 she says	 ""Ah	 it's probably about my alimony. I've been waiting for the police to take a hand in it	"" it's more of a rib to Powell rather than a serious statement. It still works well	 and it shows how a good actress can make a part her own.<br /><br />Definitely worth watching	 as William Powell and Jean Arthur always were."	1.0
"This movie should not be compared to ""The Sting""	 or other caper/heist/con game films. What makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships	 deceit and trust. It's also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry	 given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale. Has Mr Mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy? Highly	 hugely recommended!"	1.0
"I enjoyed this film. It was funny	 cute	 silly	 and entertaining. Had a fine cast and really got hammered by some critics for reasons that I truly don't understand. No	 it wasn't ""The Grapes of Wrath"" or ""Casablanca"" or even ""Moonstruck""	 but it was an enjoyable film.<br /><br />Julia was excellent playing the psychotic 'man behind the man'. The story is a little silly to be sure	 but it this isn't high drama	 folks. I happened to see a review of the film	 probably the only good one it got and then ran into it one night when looking for a movie. I never heard it was supposed to stink until after I saw it	 and I'm glad I saw it. Eventually bought the VHS tape on the bargain pile	 and I watch it a couple times a year."	1.0
"This would be a watchable Hollywood mediocre if it had a good editing. It relies on the typical American thriller plot - ""who is going to outsmart everyone"". Acting is below average	 but with shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is mostly responsible if the tension in the film rises. Film was completely suffocated by blank video and sound shots and most of it looks like raw film material. All in all	 if you don't mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project	 this is a film to watch. I guess that would be enough to say on this film	 everything else could really spoil the tension that is probably low enough."	0.0

Anthony Hopkins has to be completely mentally ill to have his name attached to this one - anywhere ! I will never see another movie with him in it	 directing it	 etc.	 etc. ! I can't believe the other actors & actresses that I liked	 (in this picture)	 that stooped so low to be a part of this disaster ! There must be some great drugs out there ! For anyone to not be embarrassed to be a part of such a film	 is beyond me ! Save your money on this one ! HUGE FLOP from beginning to end ! Shame on you Mr. Hopkins ! Also	 shame on Christian Slater ! I can't believe you put your reputations on the line for this one !"	0.0
"Extremely poor action film starring the ever wooden Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee trapped in a sidekick role that never seems to gel. The action is at best average	 a bit of nudity chucked in and yes Tia Carrera does use a body double! <br /><br />The set-up is the usual renegade cop forced to break in a new partner on a big case	 the makers at least try to give the formula a twist making Lundgren the cop with Oriental values and Lee the modern city slicker but there is zero character development making it almost comical	 Lundgrens oriental warrior outfit for the big showdown has to be seen to be believed. The action sequences are by the numbers and Lee(who would go on to make the excellent The Crow) is never given the scope to show off any particular martial arts brilliance. But given his illustrious parentage he must have been under a hell of a lot of pressure and was far better served not having to live up to his father by taking on a very different role in The Crow which showed what a unique actor he may have become if not for his tragic and early death.<br /><br />Unless your a hardcore Lundgren fan or a fan of poor 80's style action movies (think Cobra etc.) then avoid.<br /><br />Poor 3/10"	0.0
"One of the worst movies I ever saw. My only thought was: ""how can I get my money back from Hollywood Video"". This is no way worth four dollars	 or any dollars. I think it was an attempt to rip off The Mexican	 or Vin Diesel's movies	 but it failed miserably to do this.<br /><br />The acting was terrible	 I felt sorry for the actors that they couldn't find something better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We were calling out the lines ahead of the actors	 it was so predictable. The Mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated	 worse than a cartoon. <br /><br />Skip it."	0.0
"Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this version of ACC without a British accent	 he more than makes up for it with his over-the-top and larger-than-life interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge.<br /><br />Particularly effective is when he confronts Bob Cratchit in his office at the movie's end. As Scott stands before a large window	 sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him; all you can see is his silhouette. Augmented by Scott's voice	 a ponderous growl	 the effect is galvanizing...much like Marlon Brando's first scene in APOCALYPSE NOW. ""The Horror	"" indeed! <br /><br />However	 as they say	 the very thing that works for you can also work against you. Because Scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie	 it proves infectious. To put it another way	 the ""before"" Scrooge is almost as charismatic as the ""after	"" even though he really shouldn't be. It's what you might call the ""Doctor Smith"" effect	 since Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies (stage and screen alike).<br /><br />Actually	 I myself don't consider Scott's glib rage a liability. But other ""Christmas Carol"" purists might. See the film and judge for yourselves."	1.0
"The 1990's begun to have day time talk shows sprout up left and right. Every network had one	 and they all lacked one thing Originality. Ricky Lake was just another show to entertain the obese trailer park mother with a Marlboro cigarette hanging out of her mouth while breast feeding one of her dozens of toothless	 illiterate children. The English language and other cornerstones of mankind where ruined by this shows existence. Titltes ranging from Girl you a Pigeon Head and so on. How could anyone want to watch this pure and utter garbage? Has our society really became nothing more than a bunch of hill billy's and dead beat fathers? The people who appear on this show were Trash. The people who watched this show were Trash. Anyone that wishes to see this show re aired or put onto DVD is TRASH. People wonder why Americans are becoming huge piles of lard and too fat to even get jobs	 its having shows like this tell them Its OK to be 500lbs overweight	 and have 12 year old girls act like prostitutes. Having such trash on TV has ruined morals."	0.0
"This movie has it all. Sight gags	 subtle jokes	 play on words and verses. It is about a rag tag group of boys from different ethnic and social classes that come together to defeat a common enemy. If you watch this more than once	 you will find you are quoting it like Animal House (and yes I love Animal House also). I put in the top 15 funniest movies. The Major at a boys military academy is paranoid that every kid is bad and wants to cause trouble (in this movie he is right). He is sadistic	 uncaring	 cruel and has to be taken down. The group of boys that do not get along at first	 end up teaming together to survive and get rid of the Major with a wacky plan only Mad Magazine could of wrote. A must see - you will love it!"	1.0
"This movie is just boring.<br /><br />It tries to copy some effects borrowed to a creative director like Jeunet in ""Amélie Poulain""	 but it is too much. The dialogs are pretty bad	 some of the worst I have ever heard	 Guillaume Canet is not convincing (I have almost never found him very convincing)	 his father in the movie plays very badly	 the story is dumb	 the ending is... stupid.<br /><br />I think I have not dislike a movie so much since ""le pacte des loups"" (brotherhood of the wolf) from Christophe Gans (and I watch / see about 80-100 movies a year)	 but at least that movie had some action and lots of good actors.<br /><br />I had never commented here (only rated)	 and when I saw the rating and the comments	 I thought I had to write something down.<br /><br />I guess we won't have problems to sell the DVD we were offered : not such a bad movie in our (large) collection !!!<br /><br />I am open minded (I watch SF	 westerns	 drama	 comedies	 silents	 horror	 fantasy... movies !)	 but this movie was so boring that I felt like I had lost one hour and a half."	0.0

"This movie portrays Ruth as a womanizing	 hard drinking	 gambling	 overeating sports figure with a little baseball thrown in. Babe Ruths early life was quite interesting and this was for all intents and purposes was omitted in this film. Also	 Lou Gehrig was barely covered and this was a well know relationship	 good bad or indifferent	 it should have been covered better than it was. His life was more than all bad. He was an American hero	 an icon that a lot of baseball greats patterned their lives after. I feel that I am being fair to the memory of a great baseball player that this film completely ignored. Shame on the makers of this film for capitalizing on his faults and not his greatness."	0.0
"If the very thought of Arthur Askey twists your guts	 don't worry	 you can still watch and love The Ghost Train	 like the equally marvellous Back Room Boy	 it is a film that is simply too damn good to be sunk by a single performance	 even that of the lead actor. Personally	 I love Askey	 perhaps it's because I go into his world	 rather than unreasonably expecting him to come into mine	 which is a mistake too many people make. The Ghost Train is so intensely atmospheric that you couldn't conceivably watch it without being amazed at the deep	 dark world it transports you to	 it is immersive in a way that few cheap and cheerful flag-wavers managed to be during the desperate early '40s and it's a film that I would imagine few people have ever watched just the once. The cast are	 without exception	 extraordinarily good	 perhaps Linden Travers lays it on a bit thick	 but against the backdrop of a lonely railway station in wartime	 she could hardly play a nutter and not stand out. The sad passing of the lovely Carole Lynne earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible film and now it really is in the past	 but waiting patiently for us to press play."	1.0
"John Carpenter's career is over if this sad excuse for a movie is any indication. His excuse is that he only produced it. Jon Bon Jovi looks like a girl. In fact	 Bon Jovi and the two Vampire girls	 Natasha Wagner and Arly Jover probably all fit in the same clothes. In short	 it was hard to tell which one was cuter in an anorexic ramp-model sort of way. Bon Jovi has the most charisma. At least he looks happy when he is smiling. The two Vampire Girls on the other hand are all cramps and complaints. At one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss	 but stop. Amazing how each Vampire movie has some set of morays for the respective vampires. At one point	 Arly Jover is providing fellatio to a very dumb Vampire Hunter and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act. It would have been an erotic moment except that it was filmed like a total goof	 and the male actor looked mildly amused as he watched Arly Jover move her head to mimic something that was very obviously not happening. As far as gore is concerned	 a few heads are ripped off	 and the blood spurts profusely. These scenes have so little suspense or build-up that when they happen it is almost funny	 and there is no ""horror"" pay-off from the scene. All you get as a member of the audience is a feeling of ""Wow	 that sure was a lot of red paint splattering on the walls. I wonder who has to clean it up."" Throughout the movie	 these Vampire Hunters who are obviously trying to kill Arly Jover (the top vampire in the world??) keep reaching out to her. At one point	 Bon Jovi goes into the abandoned Church and after he just shot her with an arrow (and has done so on other occasions)	 he says ""I am not trying to hurt you. I just want to talk to you. I want to get to know you."" HUH?? Of course	 the dumb vampire Arly jumps out to say hello and Bon Jovi sticks her again with another impaling device. ""Why Can't We Be Friends"" the 1970s hit song by WAR should have been the theme song for this movie. Aside from all of the other silly moments	 there is a transfusion sequence when Natasha Wagner has all her Vampire blood removed	 and the town people all line up to donate blood for her transfusion. I guess Blood Type is not important? Anyhow	 all her Vampire blood is removed. Bon Jovi then decides that if that blood is transfused into him	 he can beat Arly by becoming a vampire also. Of course	 as the vampire blood is transfused into him	 none of his healthy blood is removed. So apparently Bon Jovi is walking around with twice as much blood as any human can have in his body. And just like the first VAMPIRES	 this one also has the vampires-bursting-into-flames special effect."	0.0
"Maybe television will be as brutal one day. Maybe Big Brother` was only the first step in the direction Stephen Richard Bachmann` King described the end point of. But enough about that. If I spend too much words talking about the serious background topic of this movie I do exactly what the producers hoped by choosing this material. It's the same with The 6th Day`. No matter	 how primitive the film is	 it provokes a discussion about its topic	 which serves the producers as publicity. Let's NOT be taken in by that. The social criticism that is suggested by that plot summary is only an alibi to make it possible to produce a speculative	 violent movie	 more for video sale than for cinema. <br /><br />I didn't read the book. I don't dare criticising Stephen King without having read him	 but when I saw the film I thought they couldn't make such a terrible film out of a good book: In a typical 1980s set with 1980s music and some minor actors Arnold Schwarzenegger finds himself as a policeman running away from killers within a cruel TV show. The audience is cheering.<br /><br />Together with Predator`	 this is definitely Schwarzenegger's most stupid movie. 2 stars out of 10."	0.0
"Corean cinema can be quite surprising for an occidental audience	 because of the multiplicity of the tones and genres you can find in the same movie. In a Coreen drama such as this ""Secret Sunshine""	 you'll also find some comical parts	 thriller scenes and romantic times. ""There's not only tragedy in life	 there's also tragic-comedy"" says at one point of the movie the character interpreted by Song Kang-ho	 summing up the mixture of the picture. But don't get me wrong	 this heterogeneity of the genres the movie deals with	 adds veracity to the experience this rich movie offers to its spectators. That doesn't mean that it lacks unity : on the contrary	 it's rare to see such a dense and profound portrait of a woman in pain.<br /><br />Shin-ae	 who's in quest for a quiet life with her son in the native town of her late husband	 really gives	 by all the different faces of suffering she's going through	 unity to this movie. It's realistic part is erased by the psychological descriptions of all the phases the poor mother is going through. Denial	 lost	 anger	 faith	 pert of reality : the movie fallows all the steps the character crosses	 and looks like a psychological catalog of all the suffering phases a woman can experience.<br /><br />The only thing is to accept what may look like a conceptual experience (the woman wears the mask of tragedy	 the man represents the comical interludes) and to let the artifices of the movie touch you. I must say that some parts of the movie really did move me (especialy in the beginning)	 particularly those concerning the unability of Chang Joan to truly help the one he loves	 but also that the accumulation of suffering emotionally tired me towards the end. Nevertheless	 some cinematographic ideas are really breathtaking and surprising (the scene where a body is discovered in a large shot is for instance amazing). This kind of scenes makes ""Secret Sunshine"" the melo equivalent of ""The Host"" for horror movies or ""Memories of murder"" for thrillers. These movies are indeed surprising	 most original	 aesthetically incredible	 and manage to give another dimension to the genres they deal with. The only thing that ""Secret Sunshine"" forgets	 as ""The host"" forgot to be scary	 is to make its audience cry : bad point for a melodrama	 but good point for a good film."	1.0

"Considering the lack of art with in African cinema (or Black American Cinema). The Idea offers a multidimensional look at a community assigned to hoods and dealers. But the funny thing is this is not at all the focus or even the subject of the short. But it is the unstated assertion of independence from these themes that is most sticking. The genre is unique and not the typical expectation. It is almost this departure which first catches the eye	 so watching it twice is critical. The film has an aesthetic quality which lends its self to the true art of cinema.<br /><br />And it is this true art that with an African voice that is extremely rare. The film doesn't copy to attain its message	 it innovates and provokes by pulling at subtle stereotypes (not racial but character based stereotypes)	 From a writers perspective the film is brilliant. It carries multiply messages which include a very rapid character development. It must be remember this film is less than 10 minutes and it manages to establish character very quickly. The usage of colour texture and music is also to be commended. But considering the director	 Owen Alik Shahadah's last venture 500 Years Later	 music is to be expected. But from a theme point-of view it seems like the idea is a departure but the satire eludes indirectly to a social problembrilliant stuff!"	1.0
"Hard to categorize the film - perhaps it's an avant garde spy thriller? Mother Night is a very good Vonnegut novel	 and most certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film. The film adaptation is very faithful to the original book. The ""indie"" approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big Hollywood studio financing it. These days	 I doubt an intelligent novel like Mother Night would ever get the green light from the big Hollywood grindhouses. And normally that is too bad	 but not in this case. Mother Night has tight direction and a solid cast. Nick Nolte who seems to be getting better roles as he gets older	 still has that ""everyman"" persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and great as always. I always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry. I guess making your debut as a dead girl (Twin Peaks)with little air time isn't the choicest of roles	 even if the TV show becomes a minor phenomenon. Anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you don't have to read the book to understand the movie. In fact	 given today's geopolitical realities	 the novel's premise may appear dated	 and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be utterly confused by the events unfolding (I am talking to you	 fellow Americans who are students and scoring the lowest in the industrialized world in geography	 history	 and lord knows what other subjects!)."	1.0

"I'll dispense with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic New Yorker persona	 because quite frankly	 to draw comparisons with bumbling loser Josh Kornbluth	 is just an insult to any such director. I will also avoid mentioning the spot-on satire `Office Space' in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe. I can	 however	 compare it to waking up during your own surgery  it's painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what they're doing. Haiku Tunnel is the kind of film you wish they'd pulled the plug on in its early stages of production. It was cruel to let it live and as a result	 audiences around the world are being made to suffer.<br /><br />The film's premise  if indeed it has one  is not even worth discussing	 but for the sake of caution I will. Josh Kornbluth	 a temp worker with severe commitment-phobia	 is offered a permanent job. His main duty is to mail out 17 high priority letters for his boss. But ludicrously	 he is unable to perform this simple task. My reaction? Big deal! That's not a story it's a passing thought at best - one that should've passed any self-respecting filmmaker by. <br /><br />The leading actor  if you can call him that  is a clumsy buffoon of a man	 with chubby features	 a receding	 untamed hairline	 and a series of facial expressions that range from cringe-making to plain disturbing. Where o where did the director find this schmuck? What's that you say he is the director? Oh	 my mistake. Playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing	 but I suspect that Mr Kornbluth isn't that convincing as a human being	 let alone an actor. Rest assured	 this is by no means an aimless character assassination	 but never before have I been so riled up by an actor's on-screen presence! My frustration was further confounded by his incessant to-camera monologues in between scenes. I mean	 as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel	 Kornbluth insults us further by `explaining' the action (first rule of filmmaking: `dramatize exposition' show	 don't tell). Who does this guy think he is? He has no charisma	 no charm	 and judging by his Hawaiian shirts	 no sense of style. His casting agent should be shot point blank!<br /><br />The supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom I felt	 with but one exception. Patricia Scanlon puts in a very funny appearance as Helen the ex-secretary	 who has been driven insane by her old boss	 and makes harassing phone calls from her basement	 while holding a flashlight under her face. This did make me chuckle to myself	 but the moment soon passed and I was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the film.<br /><br />The film's title is also a misnomer. Haiku Tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of Japanese poetry. Don't be fooled into thinking this is an art house film because of its pretentious-sounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and made no money at the box office there's a very good reason for that!<br /><br />"	0.0
"Some films just simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a bad film. But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is	 and most of the cast holds up	 with the exception of Owen Wilson	 who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke. But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more."	1.0
"I was pleased to see that she had black hair! I've been a fan for about 30 years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the stories.<br /><br />I was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer	 it didn't spoil it at all. In fact I watched the film twice in one day	 a sure sign that it was up to standard. This is what I do with books that I like as well.<br /><br />I thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of Modesty Blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip. I would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly. Has he actually read the books?<br /><br />I thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation."	1.0
"Certainly one of the finest movies I have seen for quite some time. Exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving film. Denzel Washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date	 and the rest of the cast perform beautifully. Christopher Walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as I would have liked. A story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love. This is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets	 rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener. All in all	 a truly gripping film from beginning to end. Highly recommended!"	1.0
"what can i say. oh yeah those freaking fingers are so weird. they scare the heck out of me. but it is such a funny film	 Jim Carrey works the grinch. if you havent already seen it then what you waiting for an invitation. go	 go and get watch it. you dont know what your missing."	1.0
"I have to say that this TV movie was the work that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart is. We are so used to	 now	 seeing her in a sitcom and I really hope that a TV station will show this TV movie again soon as it will show the Sabrina fans that MJH shines in a drama. Seen as we have watched her on Sabrina now for now 5 years and so to give the viewers a taste of her much unused talent would be a plus. Melissa plays her role so well in this wanting her parents ""done away"" with so she can be with the guy she loves. One thing that all Sabrina viewers will notice	 Melissa works with David Lascher in this	 well before he took the role of Josh on Sabrina. So it would be kind of neat to see this currently whenever it gets aired again. Hopefully MJH gets some good roles in movies or even in more TV Movies	 sort of like Kellie Martin who has always shined in TV Movies. Lots of unused talent waiting to bust out when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart	 you shine always Melissa!!!"	1.0
"After perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction movie-goers. There are the ones who are well read	 extremely literate	 and intelligent. They know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author. For many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature. Considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for pre-pubescent teenagers. Today's well read fan knows well this history	 and knows the great authors Asimov	 Heinlein	 Bradbury	 and Ellison	 who helped bring science fiction out of that basement. In doing so they created thought provoking	 intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition. This well informed fans are critical of anything Hollywood throws at them. They are not critical for it's own sake	 but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye. (As they should as Hollywood's record has been less than stellar.) To these fans the story must take supreme importance. They cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics	 and non stop action sequences. When the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudest.<br /><br />The second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre. (Look at many of the above comments that state ""Well I haven't read the book or anything by this author...) Their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the Scifi channel. They are extremely uncritical	 willing to overlook huge plot holes	 weak premises	 and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects. They are	 in effect	 willing to turn off their critical thinking skills (or maybe they never had them!) for the duration of the movie. Case in point	 I Robot. While supposedly based on Asimov's short stories and named after one of his novels	 it contains little of what Asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations. (Those of you that will run out and buy I	 Robot will be very much surprised-this movie isn't even based on that story at all!) <br /><br />The film has enormous plot holes	 that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity. I won't point them out. I won't spoon feed you. You need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself. The characters	 which are named after many of Asimov's characters	 do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories. The plot itself with all it's action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for. His belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds	 not their fists	 is vital to understanding his vision of the future. In short	 other than the name	 their is very little of Isaac in anything about this movie. There will always be those uncritical (i.e. unthinking) who will state: ""The movie doesn't have to be like the book. Due to the medium	 movies sometimes require that changes be made."" But what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book (or books) from the start? What if all they took from the written work was the title? This begs the question: Why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it's title on your vacuous piece of crap? Save money and don't buy the rights to the works. Title it something else. Don't use the character's names. Believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism. In fact it won't matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him. But it will upset those who read	 who think	 who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show. <br /><br />I	 Robot	 like much of Hollywood's take on the genre	 pushes Science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago. Hollywood could not do this alone. It takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this."	0.0
"As a veteran of many	 many pretentious French films I thought I'd taken the worst the industry had to offer and was able to stomach anything. But not this. Pointless	 relentless	 violent	 unpleasant	 meaningless ... The film has nothing to offer and is random hatred and aggression dressed up as pretentious art. Avoid at all costs."	0.0
"I was dreading taking my nephews to this movie	 as I didn't think it was going to be well done. The kids	 ages 6 and 10 were set on seeing it	 so I caved. I must admit that it was not nearly as bad as I had thought	 but was still a far cry from the book. The movie seemed right on with the 10 year old's understanding and sense of humor. I found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place. I eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies don't show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the ""silly"" or ""stupid"" choices."	0.0
"This is truly one from the ""Golden Age"" of Hollywood	 the kind they do not make anymore. It is an unique	 fun movie that keeps you guessing what is going to happen next. <br /><br />All the actors are perfectly cast and they are all great supporting actors. This is the first movie I saw with Ronald Colman in it and I have been a fan of his ever since. Reginald Gardiner has always been a favorite supporting actor of mine and adds a certain quality to every movie he is in. While he played a different kind of character here	 he still added something to the movie that another actor cast in this character would not have added."	1.0
"This movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites. The voices for the animals are wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both brilliant as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch	 but the real standout is Don Ameche as the old	 faithful golden retriever. This movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults. Humorous and suspenseful	 and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry! (happy tears!)"	1.0
"I saw this on DVD ( It`s known as CORRUPT in this format ) and the blurb on the casing really hyped up how Harvey Keitel`s character Frank is so much like the one he played BAD LIEUTENANT in "" This gritty and powerful police thriller "" . What the casing didn`t mention was that this is an old Italian movie . How old is it Theo ? Well when a character plays music he doesn`t put on the CD player 	 he pulls out a big plastic pancake thing 	 puts it on a sort of revolving hob where a sort of mechanical arm touches the pancake thingy causing music to be heard . You see my point about this being an old film ? The DVD case gave no clue this was a movie made 20 years ago . It`s also a film with poor production values like so many other Italian films masquerading as American ones . With the exception of Keitel the cast are awful though Johnny Rotten`s performance is bizarre rather than terrible 	 the cinematography is static with the picture and sound quality giving the impression that I was watching a fourth generation pirate copy ( I don`t know if it`s down to a dodgy DVD or if it`s a very bad film print ) and worst of all is Ennio Morricone`s score . It`s impossible to belive the man who did the irritating intrusive incidental music for CORRUPT is the same one who did the music for those Clint Eastwood westerns.<br /><br />All of this is a pity because CORRUPT does have its moments . It`s by no means the greatest psycho thriller ever devised but it did hold my interest and as always Keitel puts in a good performance as a violent nutcase cop . Just a pity the rest of the movie didn`t match up to his high standards"	0.0
"""Vanilla Sky"" was a wonderfully thought out movie. Or rather	 ""Abre Los Ojos"" was well thought out. I watched that movie late one night	 excited about what was to come. I wasn't disappointed. By the end of the movie	 I was awstruck. I couldn't get it off my mind. The whole idea of it just blew me away. The ending	 was more of a surprise than Shyamalan could ever do. The plot line was also something that kept me interesting through and through. The cast	 superb. It was an all around wonderful movie. The kind of movie you can watch again and again and always find something new. I've seen it four or five times and I'm always finding something new. It's a movie to keep you interested forever."	1.0
"I love science fiction	 I am fascinated by Egyptian mythology and I appreciate digital animation. I figured a movie that combines these three would be at least enjoyable. I could not have been more wrong: The story (or actually the lack there of) was completely uninspired and lacks imagination - while imagination usually is the biggest component of any science fiction story. The dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porno movie. Especially Thomas Kretschmann gives new meaning to the term 'bad performance'. Bad acting wouldn't have been such a huge problem if only 'director' Bilal didn't take himself so seriously; all the lines sound like they are supposed to be poetic	 it looks like Bilal really thinks he has made a piece of art here. Well	 there's no art or poetry to be found in this piece of junk	 only pretentiousness! This man should really stick to making comics	 since he fails on all possible accounts as a director. Worst of all is the terrible digital animation	 which is so ugly that it actually turns watching this movie into a physically painful experience. The graphics look so fake they even make the werewolves in 'Van Helsing' look like live actors! And since half the characters are CGI-animated	 it is quite a problem that the CGI-effects look so fake. If the Egyptian Gods actually exist then Bilal's a dead guy	 since they will no doubt take gruesome revenge on him for the ridiculous way in which he portrays them in this disastrously bad movie."	0.0
"Years ago I did follow a soap on TV. So I was curious about this movie	 and I was so rewarded for finding it. It's a marvelous spoof of soaps	 with jealousies	 the usual actors' insecurities	 and all sorts of lovely excesses. But more than anything - an amazing cast and an incredible script. How did someone get all those top-notch actors to play in such a silly sort of movie? And how did this little movie get writers to write the perfect lines? I never hear anyone talk about this movie or even admit hearing of it	 but it's marvelous and I highly recommend seeing it. Sometimes I'll throw it on while doing housecleaning	 and end up sitting on the couch	 watching	 laughing and thoroughly enjoying the whole wonderful thing. Many congrats to all who made it."	1.0
"I have to mention two failures for you to understand that this movie brilliantly succeeded where they failed: ""A Scanner Darkly"" and ""Immortel Ad Vitam"". If you were excited by the concepts of these two movies and felt woefully disappointed (like me)	 you will probably enjoy Renaissance. It immerses you into the world of a future Paris. It is not quite dystopian. They did the animation so well that I thought it was rotoscoped	 but from what I can tell	 it was not	 it was merely motion capture. The facial expressions are amazing! Not since TRON have I seen a fantasy world so well displayed in an animation/live hybrid. The Black and White medium is used to slowly direct your attention to the subject of the scene; my favorite effect was what they did with headlight beams	 watch for it. The director plays with your attention and confusion but you are satisfied eventually by finding the thread that he wants you to find. The overall effect is a harsh and gritty urban world filled with small surprises.<br /><br />The plot is secondary	 but it isn't terrible. It is noir-ish. There is a backstory for most of the major characters giving them some depth. There is weather. There are ""sets"" so you can feel like you are in different places in Paris. There is some action	 and even a car chase. I am going to have to see this one again to get everything. I also recommend a very large screen to view it as the ""sets"" are detailed and the credits are small."	1.0
"I can't believe others took such a serious view of all this. God	 it was a lot of fun rooting for Hop-a-long Cassidy. It was a great tribute to the Western serials of years ago.

"Previous comment made me write this. It says that Muslims are blonde and Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed).

So what?I might add that I am not 100% Serb	that I have some Austrian and Croat blood within me but whats the point.I'm dark	 half-breed?Is that so?

"This was on the 30th Anniversary DVD for Blazing Saddles	 itself brilliant	 but not this. Nowhere did I see Mel Brook's name on here and I can guess why	 he's got a lot more sense to not be associated with this pilot. My gawd	 who would find this funny. Sure there may be a race issue but for me it just wasn't funny	 well cause it's simply not funny. It's like the writers didn't even try to be funny	 just to cash in on being tied with Blazing Saddles. Did they expect this show to go for several seasons when they made this pilot? Flat out	 they didn't care. It was a quick cash cow which thank god didn't cash out. I guess it's useful for historical purposes only	 or only to demonstrate how stupid and unimaginative Hollywood writers can be."	0.0
"This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. This is saying quite a bit	 considering some of the choices I've made in film rentals.<br /><br />I got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone I went to high school with is topless in it. The topless scene lasted all of about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven underneath my toenails whilst being forced to listen to Roseanne sing Big Spender.<br /><br />The ""skits"" are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker-room gags	 and it's such a blatant (and poor) rip-off of The Kentucky Fried Movie that you'll be begging for Big Jim Slade to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of ""Vince Offer"" (whoever that is).<br /><br />Unless you are a masochist	 avoid this pile of rubbish."	0.0
"Ignoring (if possible) the tediously gratuitous marijuana smoking (which seems to be mandatory in Australian government-funded films) the cast of this movie gives a reasonably credible performance. That's a far as it goes. The rest is simply awful. The plot's overburdened with ""wow"" symbolisms which are meant to look good on film but go nowhere. A gross example is the giant peach float	 obviously left over from a town parade and donated by the local canning factory. It was just too tempting to waste what was hopefully a free	 but nevertheless irrelevant	 prop! The peach is given a cursory	 unexplained wash-down at one stage but that's where it ends.<br /><br />Similarly	 the contrived ""black spot"" road sign where Steph's parents were killed	 is intended to symbolize the eventual escape from her past	 but her escape to what? She's had a pretty good deal where she was	 especially considering her visual disability and the unending	 loving patience and care of her understanding young female guardian.<br /><br />The Guinness' prize for corny melodrama	 however	 goes to the characterization of Alan. Alan successfully aspires to the noble role of trade union shop steward but ""rats"" on his fellow workers by becoming a supervisor for a wicked multi-national - hiss! hiss! As a supervisor	 Alan performs the boss' villainous dirty work. He implements redundancies until	 surprise	 surprise	 the whole plant is closed and Alan himself is left as a pathetic	 unemployed failure. No cliché-free zones here	 mate! Not only this	 but Alan also loses the seductive Steph from the most unlikely relationship you'd encounter. If you think the plot is melodramatic and didactic	 don't ask about detail. What's the significance of the shaving cream on Steph's seductive leg? Why doesn't the hotel	 where the couple makes love	 eventually twig that someone's gaining illegal entry to one of its grandest bedrooms and	 among other pandemoniums	 the sheets are regularly soiled - quite spectacularly on one occasion. Summing this movie up in one word: Avoid	 Avoid	 Avoid."	0.0
"Basing a television series on a popular author's works is no guarantee of success. Yorkshire Television learnt this the hard way when in 1979 they bought the rights to the books credited to Dick Francis	 three of which were broadcast under the collective title 'The Racing Game'. Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley	 a former jockey turned private eye following an accident in which he lost his right hand	 only to have it replaced by an artificial one. Gwilym suffered from an acute lack of charisma ( and looked like one of the bad guys ) while Mick Ford ( who played the irritating Chico Barnes ) made me think of a horse's arse whenever he was on screen. For six weeks	 this less-than dynamic duo charged about the countryside	 foiling nefarious plots to fix races	 usually by the same methods - blackmail	 kidnapping riders or doping horses. Yorkshire Television threw money at the show	 but to no avail. Violent	 sexist	 far-fetched and repetitious	 it was quickly carted off to the knackers yard."	0.0
"I'm sure this was one of those ""WOAH!"" attractions in 1982 when Epcot opened	 but now it's just silly. The film's message is cliché. The Circle-Vision is disorienting. And that awful song at the end is grating. And I really wish they'd install seats. After so much walking	 all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes. And when you hear there's a film to see it sounds pretty glamorous! You get entertained while sitting down	 right? WRONG! You're standing there for 18+ minutes leaning against a short little railing. Disney should make a newer Maelstrom like attraction to liven things up and replace this dull	 lackluster film. NOT FUN. Skip it. In fact	 skip Canada altogether unless you're eating there. Move directly to the United Kingdom."	0.0
"The memory of the ""The Last Hunt"" has stuck with me since I saw it in 1956 when I was 13. It is a movie that was far ahead of others at the time in that it addressed the treatment of the natives	 the environment	 and the ever present contrast between the short and long term effects of greed. It is as relevant today as in 1956	 a cinemagraphic discussion of utmost depth and relevance. To top it off the setting is beautiful and the cinematography excellent. The memory of this movie will be with me to the end of my days."	1.0
"Twist endings can be really cool in a movie. It's especially interesting when the twist is right in front of our eyes	 but we just don't pay attention. Those type of twist endings are the one's that make people think. Then we've got twists like this film has. Twists that	 whether or not you pay attention	 you have no clue what's going to happen. When they reveal this kind of random twist	 instead of shock	 it's somewhat a dumbfounded reaction. This film starts off like it's going to be an interesting take on horror	 but after about 20 minutes	 it's nothing but boring dialogue and a stupid twist.<br /><br />Three young women are going to a concert	 so they get lost traveling through the woods	 and hit a tree trunk. They end up at some old creepy lady's house	 who hates men	 and they are greeted by her homely daughter Marion (Laurel Munson). Strange goings on happen as these girls stay at this house for several days instead of trying to leave or get home	 and the suspense progresses into a dumb slasher.<br /><br />This film is too caught up in it's dialogue	 and it's always between only a few characters. We have the main three girls	 the creepy spinster and the old lady	 and conversation of any importance does not go beyond these five. To make matters worse	 they never have anything interesting to say. It's actually quite maddening sitting through their conversations. We want to know what's going on	 and instead they just talk and talk and talk (about nothing).<br /><br />Plot holes are abundant here. The house these girls stay at when they get in their car accident is apparently three miles from anywhere...wow	 three miles! A two hour or less walk will kill them. Why didn't they get a ride with the worker for this household who was driving into town? Did he have a one seater? How come these girls never question leaving and just willingly stay	 rarely even checking up on each other? Why did this have to have so many dumb twists? Maybe the answers are in the boring script.<br /><br />Having a slasher film with five characters is really a bad idea. It's not thrilling	 it's not scary	 and the ending is definitely out there	 but undoubtedly dumb.<br /><br />My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 79 mins. R for nudity and violence."	0.0
"A doctor and a policeman in New Orleans have only 48 hours to locate a killer infected with pneumonic plague.<br /><br />An effective	 and classy	 little thriller directed by Elia Kazan that blends documentary realism with a race against time pulpy heartbeat. Set and filmed in and around New Orleans	 Panic In The Streets is taken from the story Quarantine	 Some Like 'em Cold by Edna and Edward Anhalt who won an Oscar for original story. It also boasts a fine ensemble cast that deliver top rate performances for their director. In turn	 Richard Widmark {bringing the method a year before Marlon did for Kazan in A Streetcar Named Desire}	 Paul Douglas	 Jack Palance (as Walter Jack Palance) & the wonderfully named Zero Mostel	 all get sweatily moody as the pursuers chase the pursued to halt the onset of a potential Black Death epidemic.<br /><br />Where the film scores its main suspense points is with Kazan's astute ability to cut back and forth between the protagonists without altering the flow and mood of the piece. From Widmark's Public Health doctor	 with hypodermic needle in hand	 running around trying to locate the bad guys so he can do good; to the bad guys themselves who are bemused as to why there is such a wide scale hunt for them; the tension is stacked up to fever breaking point. To which thankfully the final thirty minutes becomes a cracking piece of cinema. With Palance excelling as a nasty villain that ironically puts one in mind of Widmark's own Tommy Udo from Kiss Of Death three years prior.<br /><br />It's an imaginative and intelligently written story	 one that cunningly links rats and criminals to being carriers of disease. A blight on society as it were. It's noirish elements	 such as paranoia	 blend nicely with its basic procedural thriller being. While some memorable scenes are suitably cloaked by the stifling atmosphere that Kazan has created. Although some of the early character psychologizing threatens to steer the film down some over talky based alleyway	 this definitely is a film worth staying with to the end. Not essential film-noir	 and maybe not even essential Kazan	 but certainly a highly recommended film that begs to be discovered by a new generation of film lovers and reappraised by the old guard who may have missed it back in the day. 7.5/10"	1.0
"The Order starts in Rome where the head of a special order of priests who deal in ghosts & demons named Brother Dominic (Francesco Carnelutti) is found dead	 cut to New York City where one of his order Alex Bernier (Heath Ledger) is contacted by top-brass Cardinal Driscoll (Peter Weller) who ask's him to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding Dominic's death. Along with his girlfriend Mara Willims (Shannyn Sossamon) & fellow priest Thomas Garrett (Mark Addy) Alex travels to Italy to delve into his mentor's death	 as the truth begins to emerge it appears that Dominic was a 'Sin Eater' someone who absorbed other's sins & lived with the burden of them so they could die peacefully & that the Church wasn't happy about his activities. Alex must do what's right even if it goes against what he believes...<br /><br />Also know under the title The Sin Eater this American German co-production was written	 produced & directed by Bian Helgeland & didn't really do that much for me if I'm honest & I usually am	 honest that is. Anyway lets start with the mess of a script that has some OK ideas but it's throughly predictable	 excruciatingly dull & boring	 really silly at times & it takes itself far too seriously. The whole concept is daft & while it thinks it's clever with it's oh so neat twist ending that ties everything up & brings the story full circle I thought it was the most obvious & lazy way to end things. There's the usual religious themes here	 morality	 sin	 forgiveness	 faith	 belief	 prophecy's	 blah	 blah	 blah you know the sort of thing. Then there's the twists which aren't hard to see coming	 there's the abuse of power by high ranking clergymen	 corruption	 greed	 evil	 etc. you know the sort of clichéd Hollywood ideals & themes that get reused every time it deals with the Church. The Order has nothing new to say & as a serious piece of film-making it sucks	 a lot. I'm not too sure who The Order is meant to appeal to	 as a die-hard horror fan I didn't see much horror in this at all	 as a thriller it's less than thrilling	 as a mystery it's too predictable & there's nothing here to really grip or maintain ones interest & for some reason I cannot figure out the IMDb also lists The Order as an action film which is absurd as it's as exciting & action-packed as the average episode of Sesame Street (1969 - present)	 harsh maybe but it's what I think...<br /><br />Director Helgeland does an OK job	 the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme & it all looks a bit drab	 grayish & dull. For a supposed horror film The Order is very light on scares or horror elements	 in fact there aren't any of either apart from two evil kids who can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason	 don't ask. Forget about any gore or violence as there isn't any which is fine but it would have helped at least make The Order somewhat watchable. According the IMDb's 'Trivia' section the release date of The Order was put back so some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny	 all I can say is judging by the finished film the effects must have been really bad to start with because they aren't exactly brilliant as it stands now.<br /><br />I was amazed to see The Order had a budget of about $28	000	000 which is a hell of a lot of money & I just can't see where it all went apart from the sets & production design which are good. The whole film looks & feels very average & utterly forgettable. The acting is OK although the annoying fat guy who seems to be some sort of foul-mouthed comic relief irritates	 a good actor such as Peter Weller deserves better than this.<br /><br />The Order	 I prefer the title The Sin Eater actually not that it matters too much	 misses all of it's intended targets by the proverbial mile as far as I'm concerned & is a pretty dull way to waste 100 odd minutes of your life so don't do it! Not recommended."	0.0

"There are so many comments on this film	 yet I found them to be misleading. This a corner-cutting	 over-used scenario where a normal human being becomes a partner in crime to someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason. Boy meets girl. Girl holds boy up at gunpoint for something ridiculous. Boy is intrigued. <br /><br />You know the drill: The antagonist turns out to be a wild	 free spirit instead of a sociopath... Toss in a few words of wisdom from Alice Drummond and you have a recipe for Love. Sheedy's 'is she crazy or does she just need a hug?' role from The Breakfast Club simply reeks as a lead character. And all that is left is a truly ghastly turkey of a movie."	0.0
"I did not expect the performances of Gackt and Hyde to be as well done as they were	 nor did I expect them to be cast in such an artistic well-developed movie with enough plot to keep you interested and enough diversity to make it original. This movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me	 and I'll be on the lookout for the next movie like it. I especially like the fact that it is a vampire movie	 but it wasn't a cheesy vampire flick	 nor did it over embellish that fact. The characters all had human traits. The way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasteful	 and it makes you actually feel sorry for them throughout their lives. I give this movie two thumbs so far up. Definitely the best movie I have seen in the past five years."	1.0
"What a waste of time! I've tried to sit through 'Sky Captain.."" about 6 times	 and every time	 within about 3 minutes	 I start doing something else - anything else! It's a downright boring movie	 the acting is terrible	 the writing dull	 and obviously a first-time director	 because it's stiff. And I wanted to love it. I love sci-fi	 the old cliffhangers	 and I can appreciate the attempt at nods to Flash Gordon	 and Metropolis	 but my God	 what a waste of money. I used to work for Paramount Pictures	 and I had written Sherry Lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests. She told me they'd never have an interest or need to do it. 10 years later	 Paramount releases this piece of crap. Sherry was right in 1993	 but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog. Blue screen an effect shot	 but not an entire movie. Let's not forget	 neither Jude nor Jolie are terrific actors (but easy on the eyes). Paltrow's performance reminds me of a high school effort. Too bad - it could've worked	 but only under a skilled director. the funny thing is	 Sky Captain's director will keep getting work	 even after this dreck. It's commerce	 not art!"	0.0
"I really enjoyed this drama from Sidney Lumet. The best word I could come up to describe it with is insane. It throws the viewer around for an hour and fifty minutes and doesn't let you breathe until the credits start to roll at the very end. Trust me	 this movie will keep you guessing the entire way through.<br /><br />The story is very well crafted and almost brilliant. It's almost like a more complicated Tarantino type story. The acting is all amazing from all of the leads and even the small parts	 excellent cast. I also loved the cinematography	 it gave it the real feeling as if it were an independent film. It was all great.<br /><br />This movie is excited	 exhausting and heartbreaking. It's almost hard to watch but you'll be glad that you did."	1.0
This film has good characters with excellent performances from the cast. David Strathairn is diabolically sincere as the child molesting salesman and Danny Vinson plays a perfect pussy-whipped southern husband. The slick soundtrack betrays the murder ballad tone of the film.	1.0
"On the surface	 ""Written on the Wind"" is a lurid	 glossy soap opera about the sexual dysfunctions of a Texas oil family. But underneath it all is a deep	 social commentary on 1950's life. Director Douglas Sirk scores again with another Univeral sudser. Robert Stack falls in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that Stack's best pal	 Rock Hudson	 loves her too. When Stack finds out he's sterile and Bacall ends up pregnant	 the fireworks fly. And	 the all-too-good Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for her portrayl of Texas' biggest nympho who is shunned by Hudson. Good epic soap opera."	1.0
"Could anyone please stop John Carpenter from continuously and deliberately ruining his reputation? How low can you go? It seems this man has lost any self respect.<br /><br />This episode looks like it has been done by a film student	 it isn't even worth beginning to talk about WHAT was bad	 because it was just a borefest	 directed by somebody with no talent as a filmmaker or without any motivation...<br /><br />Come on	 Mr. Carpenter	 please retire immediately with a rest of self-esteem and stop spilling out trash like this in a bad tradition from Escape from L.A. to Ghosts of Mars.<br /><br />Get drunk instead."	0.0
"I had quite high hopes for this film	 even though it got a bad review in the paper. I was extremely tolerant	 and sat through the entire film. I felt quite sick by the end.<br /><br />Although I am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema--I thouroughly enjoyed both Woody Allen's 'Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex	...' and Michael Hanneke's 'Funny Games'--I found the directors' obsession with this ten-year-old wanting to drink women's milk totally sickening. And when the film climaxed in an ""orgy"" where the boy drinks both his mother's milk	 as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film	 I almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and sentimental pap that it is.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong	 I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema	 as well as independently made films	 so this flick should have pleased me enormously. Avoid this film at all costs	 it should be relegated to the annals of History as a lesson in bad cinema."	0.0
"Reviewed at the World Premiere screening Sept. 9	 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).<br /><br />This had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of eWaste (recycled computers	 keyboards	 cables etc. shipped over to China by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back) and other desolation.<br /><br />The filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to Chinese censorship. Still	 what was there was interesting. The bits of a Shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens	 intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking. The opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was quite something as well. Scenes of the activity at the Three Gorges Dam project were also a complement to the Jia Khang-je films at TIFF (the feature Still Life/Sanxia Haoren & the documentary Dong) which were also built around that subject.<br /><br />Director Jennifer Baichwal	 Producer Nick de Pencier	 Cinematographer Peter Mettler and subject Edward Burtynsky were all there on stage for a Q&A after the world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in China itself."	1.0
"This is one movie that will take time to get out of your head once you have seen it. The dialogs are close to perfect	 which was to be expected as it has been adapted from a play. The actors are simply giving their best	 the story is simple and attractive. 88 minutes of pure bliss!<br /><br />Yvan Attal is totally credible in his role	 Sandrine Kiberlain is still the beautiful blonde (but not so dumb) providing as much pleasure to the eyes as to the ears	 Jean-Paul Rouve is providing an excellent approximation of the total jerk (and proud to be such)	 and Marina Fois is the dumb friend who is always blundering when you expect it least.<br /><br />Thumbs up to Bernard Rapp and associates for adapting this excellent play	 and all the best for future productions!<br /><br />I wish there were more of these in nowadays production. If you liked it	 you will also probably enjoy: ""Un air de famille""	 and ""Cuisine et dependances"". Both were written and played by the couple Bacri/Jaoui."	1.0
"Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels with her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and their baby son Alex to spend a couple of days with her family in Savage Island	 an island of their own. The couple expects to resolve their issues along the weekend in the remote island. While waiting for the boat	 Julia and Steven meet two weird men in the harbor	 and when her brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives	 he explains that a family of hillbilly squatters is living in the island. The reckless Peter smoke pot while driving the truck in the night and turns the headlight off to show off; however	 he accidentally runs over the young son of the Savage's family	 but in the dark he believes he has hit an animal. Later	 the Savage family claims Alex as a compensation for their lost son. The Young family does not accept the trade	 and they initiate a deadly war between families.<br /><br />""Savage Island"" is a very low-budget movie	 with a stupid screenplay	 amateurish cinematography but surprisingly good acting. The flawed story is totally absurd	 and there are many unbelievable situations. For example	 how could two men leave two women with the baby alone in the road during the night with the menace of the deranged family? The logical procedure would be going immediately to the continent and bringing police force to rescue Peter. Then the Young family vanishes; Julia and Steven leave their car in the continent and their house and friends	 and nobody chases them? Peter calls his sister Julia of Alex when he arrives with the boat in the beginning. There are so many flaws in this flick that I could spend many lines writing about this subject. I believe this film was filmed with a home video camera so awful the images are. The good cast deserved a better material to work. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Ilha de Sangue"" (""Island of Blood"")"	0.0
"A FROLICS OF YOUTH Short Subject.<br /><br />A teenager	 embarrassed by his fear of dogs	 runs away from home. The abandoned spaniel he finds helps to change his mind.<br /><br />PARDON MY PUPS is an enjoyable little film	 with Shirley Temple stealing all her scenes as the hero's lively kid sister. The opening gag - dealing with bedwetting - is in poor taste	 but is quickly forgotten. Highlight: the climactic fisticuffs	 which look impressively realistic.<br /><br />Often overlooked or neglected today	 the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents	 both in front & behind the camera. The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film	 something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel. Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material	 short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios' feature films."	1.0
"The '60s is an occasionally entertaining film	 most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film. It is extremely uneven	 and includes many annoying elements. Take for instance the switch between black & white	 and color. If done right	 this could of been fairly effective	 but because it was done poorly 	 it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience; much of the film had an odd feel to it. The acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for TV flick	 but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were not coherent	 and ending up being confusing. How did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's? The ending was much too sappy for my tastes; because it was hollywoodized	 everything had to turn out right in the end. I would advise you to not waste your time on The '60s and do something else with your time. I'm glad I watched this in class	 and not on my own time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. Those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick. I hope you take my advice	 and stay away from this."	0.0
"Greatly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman	 Nina Foch	(Julia Ross) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position. Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes	 (Dame May Witty) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job. George Macready	 (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives. This was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery. This strange family all live in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England and there is secret doors and plenty of suspense."	1.0
"As did others in this forum	 when ""Fobidden Planet"" was offered in 1956	 I rushed to see it. This story is an interesting phenomenon I suggest because young	 old	 male	 female	 sci-fi experts and people who find such fare 'way out"" all can follow and enjoy this film's story and plot lines very well. This is the first movie set on a planet other than Earth in the 20th Century other than serials such as ""Flash Gordon"". Leslie Nielsen was vocally a bit weak for his role	 at that time	 but Walter Pigeon	 Marvin Miller	 Anne Francis	 Richard Anderson	 Earl Holliman and especially Warren Stevens all acquitted themselves very well. There are so many visual splendors in this one	 it's hard to choose a favorite from the film's scenes. The approach to Altair-4	 the starship itself	 the landing on the planet's alien surface	 the descent via extensor stairs	 the first view of the landscape	 the approach of the rocket-sled	 Dr. Morbius's house seen from without and from within	 the underground complex and its wonders	 the setup of the weaponry	 the battle with the monster	 the final approach of the unseen destroyer	the escape from the doomed planet--all these scenes are etched into the viewer's mind because we discover them along with the participants. Veteran Cyril Hume's literate script was filmed intelligently by long-time director Fred McLeod Wilcox with clarity and imagination. it is a shock to realize there's no music at all; the film is carried by the words	 the actors and the mystery-revelation storyline. It can be watched again and again with pleasure--I have been doing so for nearly fifty years. Until this famous and well-loved film was created	 no film had tried to imagine a world beyond Earth; and for decades afterward	 ships kept crashing back on the planet--as if the writers' imaginations were failing and causing the crashes. Still the best	 many say. That says something negative about this nation's so-called intellectual leaders' imaginations--and something very positive indeed I suggest about those who made this gem."	1.0
"This is the best series of its type I've seen all year. I can't help thinking it's just my luck - a series I love gets 6 episodes (and more next year) and the constant stream of cookie-cutter cop shows get never ending episodes.<br /><br />I think the reasons New Tricks succeeds are many. The scripts are good	 and the mix of characters superb	 The acting is top flight	 and the blend of comedy and drama works a treat. The stories aren't all that memorable	 but that's not the reason I watch shows like this one. <br /><br />The theme song is a favourite	 and we were disappointed to find it isn't available in any published edition. Great stuff	 BBC- a triumph of sense over sex-appeal (aside from the young constable nobody's there as eye-lolly	 and even if he IS	 he can still act!)."	1.0
"When I was a kid	 I remember watching this while visiting a friend of our ""Uncle"" Phil. We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story is a silly cartoon about a dinosaur called Rex (voiced by the wonderful John Goodman). He tells a little boy dinosaur the story about how the dinosaurs came back to Earth to live. He explains that he was part of the thing that brought them back	 along with some friends. The Doctor/Professor villain of this film I think might have been responsible for them being them back	 but I don't care about him. The kids might like this	 but personally it is just too cheesy. John Goodman was probably the only decent thing. Poor!"	0.0
"This movie was very funny	 I couldn't stop smiling when watching this and have already watched it twice in a period of 2 days! The movie is distinctively unique in it's humor and visuals	 both are terrific and on par with Natali's other (more serious) movie gems Cube and Cypher. I have become a huge Vincenzo Natali fan ever since watching Cypher and everything he's made is very interesting.<br /><br />Very likable about this movie are the music and ""loser"" characters Dave and Andrew	 portrayed by David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (co-writer of the story)	 actors I both like very much. Also cool are the X-Box Dead Or Alive fights (you even see Dave playing Halo at a point) and Andrew's amazing guitar solo	 among many other things.<br /><br />All in all a great feel-good film about friendship.

"hi.. I consider Just Cause one of my favorite Sean Connery's movies	 it is a tense psychological thriller with excellent performances from the Cast	 especially Connery..it also has one of the best lines i have seen in movies	 so the dialog is pretty good in this one.. It also has one of the best scenes in movies ever	 when Sean interviews Ed Harris's character in prison is just fantastic..i enjoyed this one a lot and i can not recommend this enough	 really do not miss this one !

"If you want mindless action	 hot chicks and a post-apocalyptic view of Seattle	 then this is the show for you!<br /><br />The concept of Dark Angel isn't anything new (in fact	 there's controversy over whether James Cameron stole the idea from a book)	 but I spend the entire hour watching it every Tuesday from start to finish.<br /><br />Jessica Alba is smoking and Max' friends (original Cindy	 Kendra) are just as hot. <br /><br />The fight scenes are getting better	 but the dialogues between Original Cindy and Max need to be a little bit better (the slang sounds forced and it sounds like someone living in the suburbs wrote it).<br /><br />In my opinion	 Dark Angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for	 but if you're looking for hard hitting	 award-winning drama	 go watch ""The West Wing"" or something."	1.0
"This movie was made in Hungary i think. anyway	the countryside is gorgeous	the people who play the farming folks were totally fascinating. their horsemanship is awesome. I got more into the native people	 the farm life	 and how heroic they were trying to hide Brady from the evil Nazis who where looking for these parachutists. They even sacrificed their life in several instances. the young orphan lad that Brady befriends was a sweet kid. you will marvel at the riding i think	 and the action of trying to evade the Nazis. it is entertaining and comic in some spots and very tragic in others. Ladies have hankies handy	 as you will be devastated at the end. i own it	 and have watched it several times. in other words	 not just a one time around flick. its a keeper...."	1.0
"I first saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school	 and the film has stuck with me through the years. It's not about the soundtrack	 or cinematography	 or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting	 it's about the educational purpose	 and the message behind that is the most important. It's not a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school	 and it's not really a bad thing	 either	 but it is a problem. Tons of girls I knew are all having children now	 and I guess they never watched this great movie	 and if they did	 they clearly didn't get the message behind it all. It's about not taking chances when you're in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant the first time. It's not a myth. You don't necessarily lose out on your dreams	 but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first.<br /><br />This movie has a clear message behind it: JUST SAY NO!"	1.0
"First	 the CGI in this movie was horrible. I watched it during a marathon of bad movies on the SciFi channel. At the end when the owner of the park gets killed	 it's probably one of the worst examples of CGI I have even seen. Even Night of the Living Dead had better animation.<br /><br />That said	 the movie had almost no plot. Why were they on that island in particular? Well	 it wasn't stated in the movie. And	 why would the people keep coming into the cat's area? Makes no sense.<br /><br />One thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting. In what could be called a ""B made for TV movie"" movie	 the acting was very good. Parry Shen stood out in particular.<br /><br />If you have absolutely nothing to do on a Saturday	 watch this movie. It may be good for some memorable quotes."	0.0
"The 1960's were a time of change and awakening for most people. Social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spoke-out about their views. Racial tensions	 politics	 the Vietnam War	 sexual promiscuity	 and drug use were all part of the daily fabric	 and the daily news. This film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie	 and largely succeeded.<br /><br />In this film	 two families are followed: one white	 one black. During the first half of the film	 the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles. Unfortunately	 the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family. Admittedly	 there are more characters in this family	 and the story lines are intermingled	 but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century.<br /><br />On the whole	 the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie. The movie is a work of fiction	 but clips of well-known historical figures are used to set the time-line.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one-sided."	0.0
"This review is for the extended cut of this movie.<br /><br />I first watched Dragon Lord when I bought it on DVD many years ago. I always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of it to get the general idea.<br /><br />That being said. I've always found the storyline a bit confusing. The movie is	 after all	 a love story. And it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20 minute fight scene.<br /><br />Well	 in the extended version this is no longer so. The old ""original"" version begins off with a huge barrel-climb/rugby-like sequence which is the new ending sequence in the extended version. The opening sequence is Dragon(Jackie Chan) hanging around his house and pretending to be training and reciting whenever his father is around.<br /><br />Other sequenced have also been shift or prolonged in the extended cut and the story makes a lot more sense when you watch it. The pacing is also better and overall it just works better. It feels more like a love story and doesn't leave you asking questions about why it ends so drastically and dramatically as the regular version does.<br /><br />I suggest everyone who is a Hong-Kong cinema	 or just plain Jackie Chan fanatic to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intended.(Or at least that's how I think it was intended. Why else would they make it and rearrange some of the scenes) When I was done watching it	 I felt like I had watched a completely new Jackie Chan movie although most of the sequences were the same."	1.0
"""Xizao""	 is the tale about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions	 and its effects on a family in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu)	 is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) makes him believe that his father Liu (Xu Zhu)	 has died. He founds that his father is still alive	 as well as his old neighborhood and his father old business	 the public bathroom.<br /><br />The movie centers around Da Ming's family	 and how he has to learn the importance of his father's job	 something he always had considered an old tradition that had to die soon. Also	 the movie explores his relationship with Er Ming	 who is mentally challenged	 and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies	 but also their souls.<br /><br />The two main themes of the movie	 the family and the problems of progress	 are incredibly well handled	 and the movie never loses the point it is trying to make	 both themes are very good developed and we get a glimpse of Chinese society and customs.<br /><br />The director	 Yang Zhang	 tells his tale in a simple way	 letting the characters characters do the job. It is a very simple approach	 but it fits the movie perfectly	 and I highly doubt that another style would fit the movie this good. Zhang has enormous potential	 as he can tell a story without the aid of visual flare or camera tricks.<br /><br />The acting is outstanding in its naturalistic approach	 everyone acts in a very natural way and it almost looks as if they were real persons being filmed. The three lead characters give remarkable performances	 and Wu Jiang as Er Ming surely steals the show.<br /><br />Even when the movie could had sticked to a patronizing ""old days were much better"" message	 instead it takes an attitude of equilibrium	 like saying that progress is good	 and we must move on	 but we must not forget where we came from	 and keep an equilibrium between modern life and the traditions of old.<br /><br />An awesome	 and touching film. 8/10"	1.0
"Perhaps being a former Moscovite myself and having an elastic sense of humor prevents me from tossing this movie into the 'arthouse/festival crap' trashcan. It's not the greatest film of 2005	 nor is it complete garbage. It just has a lot of problems. I also sincerely doubt this movie was banned due to any 'ideological fears'	 or 'conservative taboos' or any other reason this movie might conversely be called 'courageous' and 'uncompromising' abroad. It was banned because the censors knew 99% of the Russian film-goers would find it offensive because of the bad taste exercised during the shooting and editing of this otherwise dull film.<br /><br />So we have a strong opening shot. Wonderful sound design	 excellent premise - laden with meaning and symbolism. The usage and placement of symbols will consistently be of the film's strongest aspects (not that the number 4 is a daunting visual challenge). Over the next 40 minutes we have an equally strong setup. An amusing and well-written bar conversation among the 3 (main?) characters	 and we feel pathos for these people	 the great country of Russia	 the human condition and all that. Then the movie starts slowing down. We begin to wonder what -yawn- lies ahead.<br /><br />The rest is quite boring	 simply put. Sure	 the guy in the village tugs the heartstrings	 and there are some slightly amusing moments. Nice sound	 sure. But the enjoyment of this movie	 not to mention the plot	 are seriously compromised by the pacing problems. And this	 this lack of a payoff for sitting through all the (nicely-shot) abject misery and bleakness	 is what ultimately will make people angry at the 'offensive' stuff (personally	 the main offensive scene bordered on being endearing	 in that pathetic way harmless drunks can appear).<br /><br />If you want to watch an enjoyable movie where Russians get wasted for prolonged periods of time (the entire film)	 watch Particulars of the National Hunt. Much more rewarding post-Soviet stuff. So yeah	 a 4 out of 10 for 4	 nice and symbolic of my post-mediocre-film condition."	0.0
"Having read the reviews for this film	 I understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good. However	 this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time. The majority of reviews that i had read	 said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow. And whilst some parts do leave you confused	 the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you've missed so much. It's not like ""Lock	 Stock..."" or ""Snatch""	 in the sense that it isn't that funny (in fact	 it's pretty dark)	 and it is a lot more intelligent	 in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints (and	 in one of the best scenes of the film	 Jason Statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself). The way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned	 is that it is full of memorable characters	 specifically Statham	 who gives a fantastic performance as the lead	 and Ray Liotta	 who spends most of the film in Speedos	 but gives a great performance none the less. If you've got time	 and have time afterwards to think about the film	 and even watch it again	 you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film. I think it's fantastic	 and that Guy Ritchie is a director on top of his game."	1.0
"I think I usually approach film festival comedies with the low expectation that they will invariably be ""quirky	"" and that any intended humor will be derived solely at the expense of the characters' simplicity in the face of a complicated context. What was exceptional about Big Bad Swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film while still finding laugh-out-loud humor in scene after scene. There was a sophistication	 maybe due also in part to the sharp work of the DP	 I've rarely seen in an indie film	 and even more rarely in a comedy. Of special note here: Paget Brewster's turn as Amy the math teacher. After seeing this performance I cannot understand why Brewster hasn't been ""discovered"" by a larger audience. She brings the necessary mix of anger and likability to the role that really helps this picture reach its potential. This is a terrific work deserving of a larger audience. I look forward to more from the director and this cast!"	1.0
"I had intended to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Marcello Mastroianni's passing with numerous unwatched films of his that I own on VHS; however	 given my ongoing light-hearted Christmas marathon	 I had to make do with just this one! As it happens	 it features one of his best performances - and he was justly Oscar-nominated for it (with the film itself being likewise honored). This was also one of 14 collaborations with that other most widely-recognized star to emerge from Italy	 Sophia Loren; both	 incidentally	 are playing against type here - she as an unglamorous housewife and he a homosexual! <br /><br />By the way	 the film's title has a double meaning: the leading characters are brought together on the historic day in which Hitler came to Italy to meet Mussolini (the event itself being shown in lengthy archive footage)	 but it more specifically refers to the stars' 'brief encounter' in which they share moments of friendship	 revelation and	 briefly	 passion - though each knows that a return to their normal existence is inevitable	 which leads to the film's abrupt bittersweet ending. This is virtually a two-hander (with all other characters - save for the nosy concierge of the apartment block in which the story takes place in its entirety - which include Loren's gruff and fervently patriotic husband	 surprisingly played by John Vernon	 appear only at the beginning and closing sequences); still	 the cramped setting doesn't deter director Scola (for the record	 this is the 7th film of his that I've watched and own 3 more on VHS) and cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis	 so that the result - though essentially low-key - is far from stagy: the camera is allowed to prowl the various sections of the large building	 observing the proceedings intimately or dispassionately as the situation requires	 but always keenly.<br /><br />The narrative	 of course	 depends entirely on the performances of the two stars for it to be convincing	 and they both deliver (their on-screen chemistry is quite incomparable); it's interesting	 however	 that while Loren walked away with the prizes in their home turf	 it's Mastroianni's moving yet unsentimental outsider (the film	 somewhat dubiously	 does seem to equate his sexual deviance with Anti-Fascism!) who generally impressed international audiences!"	1.0
"Okay	 I've always been a fan of Batman. I loved the animated series	 and even Batman Beyond. I even read a batman comic now and then. So as can be imagined--I was a little excited when I heard about this series	 and then I was SEVERELY disappointed. This series is nothing. It doesn't even begin to compare with the original series. It's like one long TOY commercial. No depth whatsoever. And what the heck was with the Joker? Who	in my most humble opinion	 is the best Batman villain of ALL time and they KILLED him. I wish I could say his design was the worst part. Actually	 I wish I could say there was anything about this series that was remotely creative or interesting. In short (because believe me I could say so much more)do NOT waste your time on this show	 or your money."	0.0
"I saw this film earlier today	 and I was amazed at how accurate the dialog is for the main characters. It didn't feel like a film - it felt more like a documentary (the part I liked best). The leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as any fifteen year-old girls I know.<br /><br />All in all	 a very enjoyable film for those who enjoy independent films."	1.0
"i couldn't help but think of behind the mask: the rise of leslie vernon (a massively more amazing film) when watching this because of the realistic feel to it as well as the great innovative idea. this could have been a GREAT film. the acting is...from some of the actors alright. from others...it's downright horrible.<br /><br />that aside the idea is great and the format is great. the story is pretty good as well	 though suffering often from big blows to the logical mind.<br /><br />nevermind that though right? it IS a horror movie after all.<br /><br />i really want to see this remade...i really want it to be the fantastic film that it wants to be.<br /><br />however (and you can't really fault the minds behind the movie for this) this is obviously built upon a shoe string budget. and the fx really hurt the film overall.<br /><br />great movie. ...if you were to swap out for some better acting and slightly better fx.<br /><br />whoever wrote it should keep going though	 great idea here."	0.0
"Highly implausible	 unbelievable	 and incoherent Spanish production about...well	 let me see just how close I can get to it. The film opens with a woman having one of her cat's killed by a young girl. She then begs her lover to take her somewhere on his vacation. He calls work and demands that he loses his vacation time and she says he will pay for this. What relevance this plays out to is anybody's guess at the film's end	 because the guy	 a swarthy photographer	 spies a beautiful Patty Shepard	 queen of Spanish horror films it seems	 taking her bikini top off momentarily so he can snap a picture	 ask her out to lunch	 and then to his assignment to Witches Mountain - for reasons again we are never privy to. Before they go	 Patty must stop by the house and loud	 ""eerie"" chanting echoes in our hero's ears. Again	 this is never explained. The film goes on with these two stopping at an inn	 going on to the mountain	 and finally realizing why the mountain is called Witches Mountain. You know	 there are several aspects to this film which make it better than a bad film. It has some atmosphere	 some of the character actors are really quite good(especially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman)	 the leads are at least adequate	 and the climax - though it makes absolutely no sense at all - is well-choreographed(literally) with the witches in white brassieres and long black hair. It just doesn't make any sense though	 and that is a huge detractor to me. I could watch the film another ten times and still not know more now than I did after the first viewing. That is a major problem. The Witches Mountain is a curious film from the long line of cheap	 atmospheric European horror films that blanketed that decade. If you can get more out of it than me	 better power to you."	0.0
"I am frankly surprised how little has been done in film on the Columbine Massacre. There isn't a major documentary	 very puzzling. Fortunately we are graced with the talent of Ben Coccio who directed ZERO DAY	 and Gus Van Sant who did the equally fine ELEPHANT. Two different takes on the event	 which have in common the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery	 that there's something ultimately baffling and unknowable about the motivations of the two killers	 and what actually drove them to carry it beyond fantasy into horrible reality. ZERO DAY	 purportedly made up of videotapes made by the shooters and found after the event	 is absolutely riveting. Even if you know where it's going	 you still harbor hope that it WON'T ""go there"" ... and the tension in the final minutes of the movie is excruciating. The film is terrific from top to bottom	 from director to script (not much improvised	 though it appears very spontaneous) to the two lead actors	 and the supporting players as well. There is only one aspect of ZERO DAY that troubled me. Okay	 so we can't fathom why the shooters would do what they did	 but certainly one of the contributors was their ANGER. Yet these boys don't really seem angry. They may say some things to indicate that they are	 but in fact they didn't convince me that they had SOMETHING inside them that compelled them to kill innocent people. But this still leaves me with the sense of ""why???"" that director Coccio wants me to have. Anyway	 rent or buy this movie	 it will creep up on you and stay with you for a long time. The BLAIR WITCH folks could only WISH for the kind of success these guys had at making a mock documentary."	1.0
"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** From its very opening credits this fantastic movie sets the record straight: it's an instant classic. It doesn't take long to realize that this movie is big	 bigger than `Kindergarten Cop' or `Police Academy 7.' The sheer greatness of it left me speechless as I walked out of the movie theater and proceeded right back to the ticket counter to purchase myself another dozen of tickets.<br /><br />This is a movie that simply requires multiple viewings. The first watching will surely leave you with that strange `Huh?' feeling	 but don't feel embarrassed - it happens to the best of us. The story is so diabolically clever that one has to wonder about the mortality of its authors. What seems to be a simple story of an idiot infiltrating the FBI	 turns out to be an allegorical story that works on several levels and teaches us all about the really important things in life. The complexity of the plot structure will baffle you on your first viewing	 but don't give up! Not until my sixth or seventh viewing did I only begin to unravel some of the hidden mysteries of `Corky Romano.' And watch out for the unexpected twist at the end	 otherwise you might be caught completely off guard when it is revealed that FBI agent Brick Davis is FBI's most-wanted criminal	 Corky is not a real FBI agent	 Pops Romano is innocent	 Peter Romano admits he's illiterate and Paulie Romano comes out of the closet as a homosexual. Surprised the hell out of me	 I can tell you that much.<br /><br />Chris Kattan's comedic talents are unmatched as he leads his character Corky Romano through a maze of totally unpredictable situations. Reminiscent of John Reynolds' performance in `Manos	 the Hands of Fate	' Kattan takes on innumerable multiple personalities and tackles all scenes with perfect comedic timing. However	 Kattan is not just about comedy. He is a master of drama as well	 as he controls the audience's feelings with the slightest moves of his face. His facial expressions reflect life itself	 in a way. For example	 in the scene in which he farts into his brothers' faces	 you can see the expression of social injustice and alienation clearly reflected on his anguished face. At a moment like that	 it's hard to find a dry eye in the house.<br /><br />Screenwriters David Garret and Jason Ward are the real heroes of `Corky Romano.' With a story of such proportions	 it's easy to understand why two experienced writers had to be employed to complete this ambitious project. Their skillful storytelling and unorthodox structuring makes `Pulp Fiction' look like a mediocre Saturday Night Live skit. Garret and Ward's story is so compelling and alluring that it grips you by your hair	 swallows you entirely	 shakes you around and spits you right out. At the end of the out-of-this-world experience known as `Corky Romano' you find yourself a different person with different worldviews and different ideas	 and with only one question on your mind:<br /><br />Why	 God? Why?!?"	0.0
"A ""friend""	 clearly with no taste or class	 suggested I take a look at the work of Ron Atkins. If this is representative of his oeuvre	 I never want to see anything else by him. It is amateurish	 self-indulgent	 criminally shoddy and self-indulgent rubbish. The ""whore mangler"" of the title is an angry low budget filmmaker who murders a bunch of hookers. There is a little nudity and some erections	 but no single element could possibly save this from the hangman's noose. The lighting is appalling	 the dialog is puerile and mostly shouted	 and the direction is clueless. I saw a doco on American exploitation filmmakers during the recent Fangoria convention. Atkins was one of those featured. He spoke like there was something important about his work	 but after a viewing of this	 I see nothing of any import whatsoever. There is no style	 either	 and the horrible video effects (like solarization) only enhance the amateurishness. Not even so bad it's fun. Avoid."	0.0
"Knowing how old a film is	 ought to prepare the viewer for a few things	 and	 with those things in mind	 perhaps the movie'll be more tolerable. So it was when I watched Revolt of the Zombies. The heavy reliance on tedious dialogue and corny movements should be expected	 as should the primitiveness (or absence) of special effects in those days. A great deal is asked from the imagination of the onlooker - maybe too much	 in this case. And the plot isn't easy to follow: Some zombiefied southeast Asian soldiers in WWI performed very admirably. Although skeptical as to why	 if true	 the explanation should stay out of the wrong hands	 so	 off goes a group to archaeologically investigate. The key to long-distance hypnosis is learned by a member of the expedition	 who uses it to	 among other purposes	 temporarily dispense with the beau of the gal for whom he has the hots. To prove his love for her	 he gives up his hold on everybody	 which he shouldn't have done 'cause	 once they're all unzombiefied	 many want to kill him so that he'll never control them again. Below average	 even with precautionary forethought. Recommended for only the extremely patient."	0.0
"I'd passed this title 15 or 20 times while in Blockbuster	 looking for something halfway decent to watch. All I can say is that they were all out halfway decent films the night I chose to rent this.<br /><br />I will give it credit for being leaps and bounds better than ""Dracula 3000""	 but in actuality that's pretty easy to say since this one DIDN'T have Caper Van Dien in it. The other things it lacked in spades were: an interesting cast	 interesting story	 good dialog and originality	 but I suppose you can't have everything.<br /><br />***SPOILERS AHEAD*** The misfit crew of vampire hunters (one of which was a vampire... go figure) flew around from mining colony to mining colony trying to wipe out all the vampires it could find. The crew consists of: the cocky	 ne'er-do-well captain (who dies early on)	 his by-the-book	 yet inexperienced first mate	 the aforementioned vampire vampire hunter (not a typo)	 a wannabe cowboy and a REALLY	 REALLY butch Asian commando	 ""tough guy"" female... it almost sounds like the cast for MTV's 'The Real World'. After the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a mob of bloodsuckers (and as it turns out	 lovers of the finer parts of human anatomy) his first mate takes over... blah	 blah	 blah... everyone hates him... blah	 blah	 blah... I could go on	 but as I said it's the same storyline used in about a hundred other 'films' of the genre.<br /><br />The effects were cheese and why Michael Ironside was in this movie is beyond me. The vampire vampire hunter (still not a typo) was pretty hot	 but of course if you're waiting for her to expose more than just her cleavage	 look elsewhere.<br /><br />I can't say that it was the worst film I've seen	 as I actually rented 'Starship Troopers 2'	 but wait for this one to come on the Sci-Fi Channel."	0.0
"I thought ""What's New Scooby-Doo"" was pretty bad (yes	 I'm sorry to say I didn't like it)	 since Hanna-Barbera didn't produce it and it took a drastic step away from the old series. When I heard ""Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue"" was in the works	 I thought it could be better. But when I saw a pic of how Scooby and Shaggy were going to appear	 I knew this show was going to be bad	 if not worse. I watched a few episodes	 and believe me	 it is just yet another ""Teen Titans"" or ""Loonatics Unleashed""-wannabe. No longer are Scooby and Shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool	 creepy monsters that rob banks. Now they are going after a typical super-villain whom wants to destroy the world. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo have become more brave	 too. Also	 since Shaggy IS NOT going to be a vegetarian in this series	 Casey Kasem (whom actually IS a vegetarian)	 the original voice of Shaggy	 will NOT voice Shaggy. He will only voice Shaggy if he doesn't eat meat	 and that was just a stupid corporate-done change to update the franchise	 as if the Internet jokes weren't enough. So Scott Menville (whom previously voiced Red Herring on ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo"") voices Shaggy here. Believe me	 the voice is REALLY BAD! It makes Shaggy sound like a squeaky 10-year-old	 and I must agree the voice definitely fits his new ugly look. However	 Kasem DOES voice Shaggy's Uncle Albert	 which is a sort of good thing. Scooby-Doo	 on the other hand	 does not look that well. He seems to have been designed to look more like the CGI Scooby-Doo from the live-action movies. Also	 Scooby's Frank Welker voice (need I mention Brain the Dog again?) still hasn't improved. Robi	 the robotic butler	 is practically worse than Scrappy-Doo! He tries to be funny and does ""comical"" impressions and gives safety tips (""Remember kids	 don't stand under trees during a thunderstorm!"")	 but it just doesn't fit into a Scooby-Doo cartoon. Again	 the Hanna-Barbera sound effects are rarely used here. However	 on one episode	 ""Lightning Strikes Twice	"" they use the ""Castle thunder"" thunderclaps during it	 almost extensively! (Although they DO still use the newly-recorded thunder sound effects	 too.) Scooby-Doo hasn't use ""Castle thunder"" sound effects since 1991. But my question is	 why use ""Castle thunder"" on ""Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue	"" while NOT use it on the direct-to-video movies or even on ""What's New Scooby-Doo!"" (Two episodes of WNSD used it	 and it wasn't enough	 unfortunately.) If WNSD and the DTV movies used it	 then they might be better than this crappy cartoon. The day this show premiered	 I watched the first episode	 and it was SO bad I turned it off after only five minutes! To get my mind off of this poor show	 I rented ""Scooby-Doo	 Pirates Ahoy!"" which came out around the same time. And you know what? The ""Pirates Ahoy"" movie was actually BETTER than ""Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue"" (and even better than ""What's New	 Scooby-Doo!"") And it looks like the new designs that the characters have isn't permanent to the franchise. The direct-to-video movies coming out while this show is being made use the regular character designs	 thankfully. But	 whether you loved or hated ""What's New Scooby-Doo	"" I don't recommend it. But if you HATE the old series	 THEN you'll love it! (Oh god	 I hope the old Scooby-Doo cartoon stay better than this new $#*%!) Anyways	 like WNSD	 a really bad addition to the Scooby canon."	0.0
"No redeeming features	 this film is rubbish. Its jokes don't begin to be funny. The humour for children is pathetic	 and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package. Sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next. I couldn't enjoy the film at all. Although my child for whom the DVD was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new DVD	 neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again	 unlike with Monsters inc	 Finding Nemo	 Jungle Book	 Lion King	 etc. which all get frequent requests for replays."	0.0
"Don't waste your time on this dreck. As portrayed	 the characters have no redeeming values and watching them interact is sheer torture. ""Gothic"" was entertainment at least	 this is crap. If you like watching pretentious and spoiled poets straining to outwit each other	 this may be right up your alley. Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete jerk	 and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly bewildering. Mary Shelly appears to be the only character with any spine whatsoever	 but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without an ounce of respect. What a waste of time. See Gothic instead. I also remember seeing another superior movie based on the same subject matter	 but didn't catch the title. I was hoping this was it	 but no such luck. Not recommended."	0.0
"How this film could miss so many of the fascinating	 complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable. An unbelievably thin and unengaging plot	 ankle-deep characterisation/motivation and a really awful soundtrack (replacing tension with vast swathes of noise	 replacing the arcane musical references of the original for digitised crashes and roars. Then there are the specific references to the original which are merely ""plastered on"" over the cracks... Dreadful. In a world where gormless	 brain-dead Amerikan remakes of The Italian Job (a tear appears)	 Get Carter (sobs uncontrollably) and Alfie have desecrated our screens recently	 this one takes the proverbial biscuit. Execrable nonsense. How Ellen Burstyn ever got involved is a wonder... Rubbish."	0.0
"This is one of the very worst films Clark Gable made. Only PARNELL was obviously worse. It is just so painfully clichéd and the dialog is so lousy that it is something neither Gable nor Jean Harlow should have been proud of making.<br /><br />Gable is a heel whose illegal activities result in his girl going' to the slammer (like the gangster talk?). She holds out hope that he'll do the right thing but he just leaves her there--unknown to either of them	 gosh	 that she's ""in the family way"". Eventually	 the rogue returns to do the right thing and somehow they tie this all together into a happy ending! They seemed to have forgotten about Gable's needing to take the rap and spend several years in the hoosegow. Leonard Maltin says ""the stars are at their best here"". By what standard? Best at producing unintended chuckles? Gimme a break!<br /><br />PS--after saying this	 my wife thinks Leonard Maltin is going to find me and kick my butt. Hmmm. However	 despite my comment	 I think Mr. Maltin is the finest reviewer and human being on the planet (I hope that appeased him).<br /><br />UPDATE--2/2/08. Because I disliked this film so much the first time (especially the ridiculous ending)	 I decided to watch it once again. After all	 sometimes when I watch a film again I like it much more and realize that I was a bit too harsh. While that has been the case with several films in recent months	 I still disliked this film--even the second time. Most of it was not because of the first half of the film. In the first half	 Harlow's character was amazingly stupid but at least it was believable. But when she was sent to prison	 it was all clichés until the final ridiculous marriage scene occurred. The bottom line is that this sequence is embarrassingly dumb--it just makes no sense at all and is akin to turning the movie into some wacky fairy tale instead of a love story about two cons. I stand by my original review (despite all the ""NOT HELPFULS"") and think that aside from PARNELL and possibly POLLY AT THE CIRCUS	 it might just be the worst Gable film."	0.0
"Although I don't usually go for relentlessly heartwarming fare like this	 I happened to catch the 1994 version of ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD (AitO) on cable one Saturday morning just as it was starting. Being an Adrien Brody fan	 I was curious to see what Brody was like as a youth of 21 (20 when he filmed it	 I suppose) in this early role as Danny Hemmerling	 utility infielder for the California Angels (in the 1951 original	 the hard-luck baseball team was the Pittsburgh Pirates. The name change is a nice touch	 since it turns the title into wordplay). I decided to give the flick a chance	 and it turned out to be a pretty painless	 even amiable experience	 with a decent balance of laughs	 tears	 sweetness	 and baseball-based excitement. Also	 my 7-year-old daughter liked the angel effects! :-) Directed by Mike Nesmith's frequent collaborator William Dear	 AitO is the story of Roger (Joseph Gordon-Levitt)	 a foster child who prays real hard after his ne'er-do-well dad (the convincingly sleazy Dermot Mulroney) sarcastically says they'll be a family again once the last-place California Angels win the pennant. Soon Roger starts seeing real angels at the Angels' games	 led by Christopher Lloyd	 whose usual zany	 eccentric irreverence keeps AitO from plummeting irretrievably into The Schmaltz Zone. Crusty manager George Knox (Danny Glover in world-weary	 exasperated mode) is a hard sell	 but once the team starts winning	 he believes Roger's angel sightings	 and soon Knox has Roger and his cute li'l pal and fellow foster kid J.P. (the adorable Milton Davis Jr.) at every Angels game for good luck. Knox even starts toning down his own temperamental outbursts and profane language	 as much to appease the angels as for the kids' sake	 resulting in a funny bit when he starts dressing down an umpire in his usual way but starts editing himself as he goes along. Predictable obstacles ensue	 such as obnoxious sportcaster Ranch Wilder (Jay O. Sanders) trying to make trouble for Knox because of the angel angle. Sure	 it all works out fine for our heroes in the end	 but they're so darn amiable you don't mind! :-) Baby-faced Brody has a couple of good lines (I especially like his exchange with Glover about the emotional impact of the National Anthem at a ballgame) as well as a cute bit where a pretty blonde angel massages his shoulders before he goes up to bat. Brody isn't the only future star in AitO's lineup: his teammates include Matthew McConaughey and Neal McDonough	 and of course	 young Gordon-Levitt went on to co-star in TV's 3rd ROCK FROM THE SUN as well as such films as 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU. The always-amusing Taylor Negron and Oscar winners (but not for this film :-) Brenda Fricker and Ben Johnson lend able support. If you're a baseball fan who wants to rent a movie appropriate for the kids and check out some notable young actors before they became stars	 AitO '94 will do nicely."	1.0
"In 1692 Salem	 a devious child's lies about a slave's involvement in witchcraft sends an entire community into an uproar. Costume drama starring Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray isn't stuffy	 though neither is it a vivid depiction of contagious hysteria. Worked on by three writers (Walter Ferris	 Durward Grimstead	 and Bradley King)	 the story elements are rather interesting (especially coming out of Hollywood in 1937)	 though to anyone who has since read Arthur Miller's ""The Crucible""	 the hoked-up melodrama on display here won't be tolerated for very long. Biggest problem with the picture may lie in the casting: Colbert and MacMurray are an ill-matched pair of lovers hindered by the witch-hunt	 MacMurray being far too contemporary a presence for these surroundings. *1/2 from ****"	0.0
"Like the characters in this show	 I too was a teen during the 70s. The producers really nailed the whole zeitgeist	 of being a suburban teenager in the 70s. The 70s fashions	 cars	 home furnishings	 foods	 and fads	 are all very authentic in this show.<br /><br />The show boasts a very talented ensemble cast	 who all mesh together very well on camera. I really like the unique	 psychedelic-style film sequences. No other show does camera tricks like this. These cutting-edge film sequences	 really help to convey the campy hipness	 that characterized the 70s era.<br /><br />Overall this is a very funny sitcom. The one thing that bothers me about this show	 is it's over-reliance on cruel humor	 to generate laughs. In this way	 I think that this show tries to be too much like Married With Children. While Married with Children is a great sitcom in its own right	 it's tacky that the creators of That 70s show	 keep trying to imitate it. <br /><br />I do recommend That 70s Show	 mainly due to it's nostalgia factor. It could be an even better show though	 if the writers relied more on witty dialog	 rather than bawdy	 tasteless jokes and pranks."	1.0
"I am a massive fan of the book and Orwell is certainly my favourite writer ever since studying Animal Farm at GCSE. I bought the DVD out of sheer curiosity	 Burton is an actor I hold in high regard so when I heard that he played the role of O'Brien I was swung.<br /><br />I watched the trailer on the DVD first and some fears started to set in	 mostly regarding the frankly terrible ""Theme song""	 hearing the Eurythmics mechanically shouting ""1984!"" over and over again to an electronic beat is as bad as it sounds.<br /><br />The acting on a whole is pretty good	 Burton and Hurt play their roles well and the tension that exists in the Ministry of Truth towards the end can be felt	 especially in the harrowing Room 101 scene. However this is also where the movie is let down. The movie spends too much time focusing on the Love affair between Winston and Julia	 which frankly isn't what Orwell was writing about. He was writing about a harrowing future	 about how Ingsoc build up a mans beliefs and then shatter them all in the name of him being made to love Big Brother. The movie skips over what is essentially the most important part of the book	 Winstons coming to terms with his position in life and the world	 and his re-education via O'Brien.<br /><br />The comment on IMDb at the moment states that the movie sticks to the book is completely incorrect. Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien	 they do not commit themselves to Goldstien's Brotherhood and confess their crimes. There is no obvious mention of the initial instances where Winston finds the article with the Unpersons but it does get mentioned near the end	 if you have not read the book it is completely confusing.<br /><br />A terrible screenplay	 which some excellent acting cannot rescue. Michael Radford seems to have completely missed the point Orwell was trying to make	 and the electronica sound track is frankly terrible."	0.0
"John Wayne & Albert Dekker compete for oil rights on Indian territory	 and for the attention of Martha Scott in this Republic Pictures film shot out of Utah	 USA.<br /><br />An interesting Western of sorts due to its characters and its more modern setting	 with Wayne & Dekker playing the old and new factions of the West. It's based on a story by Thomson Burtis who co-writes the script along with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career. A pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third	 where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse. The light hearted approach to the romantic strand doesn't sit quite right	 and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by Rogell being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work. But hey	 stunt men deserve their moment of glory always. Solid support comes from George 'Gabby' Hayes and Wayne as usual has much screen charisma	 particularly when rattling off his pistol. But in spite of its better than usual Republic budget	 it remains a film of interest only to 1940s Wayne enthusiasts. 4/10"	0.0
"This is almost the worst film you will ever see! 2012 Doomsday currently pulls the rug from under this one	 for me. The props are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa once referred to as 'cheepnis.' It looks as if the space scenes were made in a 1950s power station	 just prior to demolition. The music really sucks. The acting is wooden and ham. The characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing. The plot is predictable. It is immediately and brazenly obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other films. The quality of direction beggars belief.<br /><br />But you have to see it	 if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest wastes of a tiny budget ever. This is a priceless example of a stupid movie!"	0.0
"Collusion Course is even worse than the typical ""evil white male corporate capitalist"" movie of the week. This movie is less pleasant than a toothache. Jay Leno can act.

This movie is so bad Leno's character	 a sanctimonious buffoon	 is less annoying than Morita's character	 a sanctimonious fool."	0.0
"""Panic In The Streets"" is an exciting and atmospheric thriller in which director Elia Kazan achieved a great sense of realism by shooting the movie in New Orleans	 using a number of local people to fill various roles and making intelligent use of improvisation. As a result	 the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable. An important deadline which has to be met in order to avoid a disaster	 provides the story with its great sense of urgency and pace and the problems which delay the necessary action from being taken	 then increase the tension to a high level.<br /><br />Following a dispute between the participants in a card game	 a man called Kochak (Lewis Charles) is shot and his body is dumped in the dock area. When the body is found and the coroner identifies the presence of a virus	 U.S. Public Health official Dr Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) is called in and his examination confirms the presence of pneumonic plague. Reed insists that all known contacts of the dead man must be inoculated without delay because the very infectious nature of the disease means that without such action	 anyone infected could be expected to die within days.<br /><br />As the identity of the dead man is unknown	 the task of finding his contacts is expected to be difficult and this situation is not helped when city officials and the Police Commissioner are not fully convinced by Reed's briefing. They doubt that the threat to the public is potentially as serious as he claims it is and their initial lack of commitment is just the first of a series of obstacles which prevent action from being taken urgently. The investigation that follows is hampered by a lack of cooperation from the immigrant community	 a group of seamen	 the proprietor of a restaurant and also some illegal immigrants before the man's identity and his contacts are eventually found.<br /><br />Kochak	 an illegal immigrant	 had been in a gang with Blackie (Jack Palance)	 Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Vince Poldi (Tommy Cook) and when gang leader Blackie becomes aware of the ongoing police investigation	 he presumes that Kochak must've smuggled something very valuable into the country. As Kochak and Poldi were related	 Blackie assumes that Poldi must know something about this and goes to find out more. Poldi	 however	 is very ill and unable to provide any information. Blackie brings in his own doctor and together with Fitch starts to move Poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with Reed and an exciting chase follows.<br /><br />Richard Widmark gives a strong performance as an underpaid public official who copes efficiently with the onerous responsibilities of his job whilst also dealing with his domestic preoccupations as a family man. In an unusual type of role for him	 he also portrays the determined and serious minded nature of Dr Reed very convincingly. Jack Palance's film debut sees him giving an impressive performance as a ruthless thug who misjudges Kochak's reason for leaving the card game and also the reason for the intense police investigation. His distinctive looks also help to make his on-screen presence even more compelling.<br /><br />In typical docu-noir style	 expressionist cinematography and neo-realist influences are utilized in tandem to effectively capture the atmosphere of the locations in which the action takes place. Elia Kazan directs with precision throughout but also excels in the memorable chase sequence in the warehouse and on the dockside."	1.0
"I am Curious (Yellow) (a film	 in near Seussical rhyme	 is said right at the start to be available in two versions	 Yellow and Blue) was one of those big art-house hits that first was a major sensation in Sweden then a big scandal/cause-celebre in the United States when the one print was held by customs and it went all the way to the Supreme Court. What's potent in the picture today is not so much what might offend by way of what's revealed in the sex or nudity- the director/""actor"" Vilgot Sjoman films the various scenes in such a way that there is an abundance of flesh and genitalia and the occasional graphic bit but it's always more-so an intellectual expression than very lust-like- but the daring of the attempt at a pure 'metafilm' while at the same time making a true statement on the state of affairs in Sweden. Who knew such things in a generally peaceful country (i.e. usually neutral in foreign affairs and wars) could be so heated-up politically? At least	 that's part of Sjoman's aim here. <br /><br />Like a filmmaker such as Dusan Makavajev with some of his works like W.R. (if not as surreal and deranged) or to a slightly lesser extent Bertolucci	 Sjoman is out to mix politics and sex (mostly politics and social strata) around in the midst of also making it a comment on embodying a character in a film. The two characters	 Lena and Borje	 have a hot-cold relationship in the story of the film	 where Lena is a ""curious"" socialist-wannabe who demonstrates in the street for nonviolence and 'trains' sort of in a cabin in the woods to become a fully functioning one	 while at the same time maybe too curious about her car salesman boyfriend. And as this is going on	 which is by itself enough for one movie	 Sjoman inserts himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film (there's even a great bit midway through where	 as if at a rock concert	 title cards fill in during a break in shooting who the crew are	 negating having to use end credits!) Then with this there's a whole other dynamic as Sjoman gives an actual performance	 not just a ""hey	 I'm the director playing the director"" bit.<br /><br />At first	 one might not get this structure and that I am Curious (Yellow) is just a film where Lena is a documentary interviewer asking subjects about their thoughts on class	 socialism	 Spain and Franco	 and once in a while we see Lena's father or Bjore. But Sjoman does something interesting: the structure is so slippery as the viewer one has to stay on toes; it's impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative	 documentary	 film-within-a-film	 and even a serious interview with Martin Luther King	 who also acts as a quasi-guru for Lena. It might not always be completely coherent analysis politically	 but it doesn't feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a Godard picture; the satire Sjoman is after is akin to a Godard but on a whole other wavelength. His anarchy is playful but not completely loaded with semantics or tricks that could put off the less initiated viewer.<br /><br />If I Am Curious (Yellow) stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a full-blown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors	 it isn't entirely successful	 I think	 as an emotional experience. Where Bergman had it down to a T with making a purely emotional film with deconstruction tendencies	 Sjoman is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors. Occasionally it works if only for the actors	 Lena Nyman (mostly spectacular here in a performance that asks of her to make an ambitious but confused kid into someone sympathetic and vulnerable even) and Borje Ahlstedt (a great realistic counterpoint to the volatile Lena)	 but some 40 years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the inner-film of Lena and Borje since (perhaps intentionally) Sjoman fills it up with clichés (Borje has a girlfriend and kid	 will he leave her	 how will Lena reconcile her father) and a heavy-handed narration from his starlet of sorts.<br /><br />And yet	 for whatever faults Sjoman may have	 ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself	 I Am Curious (Yellow) holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in Swedish cinema	 or testing what couldn't be and bending it for provocative and comedic usage. I'd even go as far as to say it's influential	 and has probably been copied or imitated in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time (a specific technique used	 with the film rewinding towards the end	 is echoed in poorer usage in Funny Games)	 and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avant-garde or meta-film-making. If it's not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as W.R. or Last Tango	 it's close behind."	1.0
"As predictable as a Hallmark card	 but not without merit	 The Rookie makes for a solid outing. Dennis Quaid	 the most reasonable jock actor working today	 is absolutely perfect as the science teacher turned baseball player Jimmy Morris. The film is never dumbed down for the children	 as would be expected from a G rated film. As a sports film	 The Rookie is one of the best I have seen since Any Given Sunday."	1.0
"Finally	 after years of awaiting a new film to continue the sexual mayhem of ""Basic Instinct""	 we have been given a great sequel that is packed with the right elements needed for a franchise such as this! I remember everything about the original	 the steam	 the romance	 the sex	 the interrogation	 the music (by the master Jerry Goldsmith)	 and everything else from violence and murder	 to intense confrontations of all kind! Make no mistake	 ""Basic Instinct"" was a real winner for audiences everywhere. I can remember in 2001 when we were first given the news about such a sequel. Five years later	 we have it. I never would have thought it to end up such as this. When it was declared a dropped project	 time sure couldn't tell if it was ever a real possibility to begin with. Well	 I guess we now know anything's possible in this case. Even if the original director	 or writer are not present	 all we need is the glamorous	 always reliable Sharon Stone	 and we have a done deal! Please	 hear me out...<br /><br />When people say that this film is bad	 I think it is only due to the fact that the style is extreme	 and slightly dated. I use the word ""dated"" only because we have not seen a certain film of the like in many years	 and audiences have become adapted to the pointless	 boring storytelling seen in other movies that actually make money	 and the only reason they make such big numbers is because those films are family friendly. Who needs hole some and clean? Of course it's a pleasant thing to have	 but c'mon! Escapism is really seldom these days	 and ""Basic Instinct 2"" gives us real fans what we've been expecting. This film is not an Academy Award winner	 nor does it try to be. It simply delivers the die-hard fans what they have been expecting. It's a film for fun. Movies today seem to take themselves way too seriously	 but this film is just loose and fun	 not taking itself seriously	 not too seriously anyway. That said	 I shall evaluate the film.<br /><br />The film is a fast-paced film from the first second	 as we see Cathernine Tremell in a car	 speeding at 110 MPH-and enjoying lustful thrills doing so. Perhaps sex and driving does not mix	 because our sexy novelist takes a bad turn and...well	 she gets away unharmed	 but her studly partner doesn't fare too well. Once again	 Tremell is the primary suspect of the accident	 and will be put under analyst's and psychiatrists. Dr. Michael Glass (Morrissey) is automatically drawn to to her from the first moment he meets her. Like another criminal investigator before him	 he is entranced and seduced	 slowly	 and surely. His denial of it all begins to crumble around him as she weaves a spell only she has the power to do. Tramell is possibly more dangerous now	 than she was before	but like the first one	 we'll never really know	 will we? Once the seduction is in motion	 jealousy	 rage	 drugs	 and a plateful of erotic scenery ensues!<br /><br />This film does not recycle the first one	 but rather mentions the previous films incidents briefly from time to time. This is a good thing. It lets us as an audience know that the script has been written to bring the level up a notch or two. Sharon Stone dazzles us again	 as though 14 years has not come to pass. Her second run of the deceitful novelist is right on the spot as earlier. Just awesome! David Morrissey is well cast	 and manages pretty well. The fact that a non-popular star was chosen	 makes his performance all the more enjoyable because we as an audience have no background on him	 just what we see him perform. My final thought-8.5 to 9 out of 10. So it's not the first one	 nor can it live up to the first ones prize winning place. It can	 however	 live up to the standards set by the first film	 and it does folks! It does."	1.0
"Judging from this film and THE STRONG MAN	 made the same year	 I would not place Harry Langdon at the top of the list of great silent screen comedians. There simply is not enough there. Perhaps he was on his way to developing his style but sabotaged himself by taking his first big successes too seriously. In any event	 all of his tricks are reminiscent of the greater funny men	 but he lacks the acrobatic skills of Keaton and the prodigious ingenuity of Lloyd. He also undermines his own persona by dressing and walking like Chaplin's tramp character. His trademarks are childlike innocence	 timidity of approach and a tendency to under-react to calamity by looking perplexed	 batting his eyes or touching his pursed lips with the tip of his forefinger. The comedy in Langdon's films results from fate throwing various obstacles in his path which he tries to overcome in wimpy or naïve ways or with a minimum of physicality	 such as throwing rocks at an approaching tornado to drive it away	 propping up a collapsing building with a two-by-four or dodging boulders by lifting a leg so that they roll under him. In this story	 about the son of a shoemaker who joins a cross-country walking race to publicize a rival company's footwear	 he manages to win by sheer luck. There is nothing here that hasn't been done far better by the Big Three."	0.0
"<br /><br />As with the other episodes in this made-for-TV series expanding on the many adventures of the sea legend	 Horatio Hornblower's super human infallibility ruins all chance for suspense.<br /><br />As little Wesley Crusher ruined many seasons of THE NEXT GENERATION	 Horatio Hornblower invincibly saves every situation. Each and every clever solution inevitably comes only from the lips of Horatio Hornblower. Immeasurably superior	 Hornblower's main trouble in this movie series seems to be tolerating the many error ridden characters above and below him in the chain of command. A perfect being makes for dull story telling. So superior is our hero	 that even those who attempt to help him are powerless to do something correctly unless Hornblower is there to direct and control their every move.<br /><br />What is the sense in telling a story about any person who cannot do wrong and will repeatedly win at everything every single time?

"This has to be one of the best comedies on the television at the moment. It takes the sugary-sweet idea of a show revolving around a close family and turns it into a quite realistic yet funny depiction of a typical family complete with sibling and parent spats	 brat brothers	 over-protective fathers and bimbo sisters. I'm almost surprised it's Disney!<br /><br />To its credit	 '8 Simple Rules' knows it's a comedy and doesn't try to be more. Too many shows (eg	 'Sister	 Sister' and 'Lizzie McGuire') think just because its lead characters are now teenagers then they should tackle social issues and end up losing their humour by being too hard-hitting. This is a trap '8 Simple Rules' has avoided; it does tackle some issues (such as being the school outcast) but it has fun while doing so. In fact the only time it has really been serious was understandably when it sensitively handled the tragic death of John Ritter and his character.<br /><br />And I think	 although John Ritter will be sadly missed since he was the reason the show made its mark	 '8 Simple Rules' can still do well if it remembers its humour and doesn't make Cate's father a second version of Paul Hennessy."	1.0
"I was always a big fan of this movie	 first of all have you seen the cast	 the acting is superb and help make this movie move along very well. Cybill Shepherd was given great reviews for her role	 and they were well deserved. The beginning of this movie starts in the past when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill) whose picture-perfect marriage comes to a shattering halt when her husband Louie dies unexpectedly. Fortunately	 Louse gets a second shot at life when he agrees to be ""recycled"" back to earth as the newborn Alex Finch (Robert Downey	 JR). Alex goes on to live his new life forgetting his past life while Corinne tries to get on with hers. But fate crosses Alexs path 23 years later when he meets Corinne's daughter Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) and is suddenly flooded with a wealth of unwanted memories (this is where the fun begins	 and embarrassing situations occur.) The music is great and the scenes are heart felt and very cute. You wont be disappointed if you give it a chance	 Chances Are you'll like it. Very funny and sweet!"	1.0
"I read some gushing reviews here on IMDb and thought I would give this movie a look. Disappointed. On the plus side the male leads are good	 and some interesting photography but as a whole this movie fails to convince. Seems to be full of its' own self indulgent importance in trying to say something meaningful but falls way short and all in all the picture is an unconvincing mess.<br /><br />It is one of those films classified as a film noir which can be defined as follows:<br /><br />""A film noir is marked by a mood of pessimism	 fatalism	 menace and cynical characters"".<br /><br />Well that is the story here: 3 losers stumble upon each other with their collective problems that include mental illness	 alcoholism	 laziness	 indebtedness etc and together they conspire to kidnap a child and outwit each other.<br /><br />Would have been a much better movie if the story was confined more to the kidnap instead of the character failings of the kidnappers. I thought the female lead was way out of her depth and came across as an amateur actress.<br /><br />Whilst some good moments	 I finished up feeling I had wasted my time.<br /><br />4/10."	0.0
"Ridiculous-looking little boogers that spawn foam and reproduce themselves. So far for the horror-elements this movie has. All the rest of MUNCHIES plays out like a really retarded comedy that's so stupid you won't find it funny anymore after about 15 minutes. I can imagine little kids cheering for these little boogers	 but adults will be left with only those supposedly ""smart"" references translating to on-screen stuff like Capt. Kirk's log entries from STAR TREK	 the most well-known scene from E.T.	 a blatant statement from the filmmakers going ""Look! We're cashing in on GREMLINS' success here!"" and a cardboard cut-out of Clint Eastwood telling us... what about his western movies exactly? That last one was totally lost on me... Oh yes	 and chemical waste disposal in caves seems to be a bad thing. Don't know where they got that idea from.<br /><br />Not to say that MUNCHIES is the most insufferable film to sit through	 for that matter. It's just really	 really dumb. And if you manage to crack a smile while watching it	 you'll probably feel as dumb yourself for having done that after the film's finished.<br /><br />Good Badness?

"Yet again	 Madhur Bhandarkar takes you on a ride to the wild side.

"""Bye Bye Birdie"" isn't one of the best musicals of all time	 but it's great fun	 and accessible to many audiences. The original film could have been wonderful	 with Dick Van Dyke reprising his signature Broadway role	 but instead they tinkered with the plot	 so the film is very unsatisfying. This re-make	 which aired on ABC in 1995	 is far more faithful to the original script	 and includes some original songs as well that were used in a national tour which this film took off from which starred Tommy Tune and Ann Reinking (who choreographed this film.)<br /><br />Jason Alexander is a very different type from Dick Van Dyke	 but he is well cast as Albert	 (before his ""Seinfeld"" days	 he started in Musical theater.) Vanessa Williams is a perfect fit for Rose. Their is also great work from Tyne Daly as Mae and Mark Kudisch as Conrad Birdie ( a role he played on the national tour).<br /><br />This film is not without it's problems though. A major liability is Chynna Phillips	 who	 however appealing	 simply looks and seems too old to be teenage Kim. And George Wendt is somewhat bland as her father	 somewhat throwing the number ""kids"" away (a number original cast member Paul Lynde stole the show with.)<br /><br />But all in all	 this is a delightful	 well-done film which the material deserved."	1.0

"The ""Trivia"" page on IMDb claims the filmmakers protested because this film was re-cut by the studio to ""simplify the plot"". If so	 that effort was a total failure	 as this is one of the most incoherent narratives I've ever seen in a film -- I'd hate to have seen it before the plot was ""simplified.""<br /><br />It's sad to see Warren with so little character to go on that even he can't do anything with the inept material. It's interesting to see Caron in '70s mode instead of her Hollywood-era glamour garb and persona	 but it's sad to see her haplessly wander through this doing-a- favor-to-her-producer-husband dreck. She would actually later hook up with and marry the director	 instead -- who	 you'll note	 never directed anything again	 but did strictly 1st or 2nd A.D. work in TV from here on out. That oughta tell you enough right there.<br /><br />I call this ""interesting"" because I have an automatic fondness for American films of this period	 and this role does add perspective to Oates' otherwise fantastic 1971 output (Two- Lane Blacktop	 The Hired Hand). But the ""1940s detective as fish-out-of-water in 1970s L.A."" theme	 which is the only thing the movie really has to say	 is sold in way too heavy- handed a manner. A similar theme would be far more effectively handled two years later in Altman's The Long Goodbye.

"Contrary to its title	 this film offers no spice and thus audience is subjected to a tasteless dish. All Humor appears forced	 theatrical	 mechanical	 staged	 reminiscent of those Pakistani plays available on video	 including even the mannerisms. Everybody is screaming	 shouting and doing odd things for no reason. The premise looks interesting as it is a straight lift from Hollywood's 'Boeing Boeing"". John Abraham who is so natural in almost all his films is a complete misfit here. If we keep morality factor aside	 even then the bizarre events looks trite. Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal	 two experienced stalwarts try hard to lift the film by being natural but in vain. At least	 the characters of three girls should be made contrasting in order to bring some interesting elements but sadly here too all of them appears those brainless	 buxomed bimbettes (3Bs) who talk	 behave and even scream in quite similar fashion. The major hole in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls at his same home pretending that they will never get to know about each other? Just to do some Sex	 what else? The same could be done in hundreds of other ways. Therefore so much dramabaazi for no reason is not something audience will digest easily. But surely	 great flesh show and tempting promos always gives such films a great initial. Now for those who call it a situational comedy	 I call it a pathetic taste. Sense of humor of such cinema going audience is surely gone corrupted and demented to the extent that they are connecting to a sadistic	 weird and maddening type of humor	 where it is not the characters that they laugh at but rather at themselves and at their own frustrations that look how senseless we have become that in order to laugh we have to bear with such things?"	0.0
"Bo Derek might have had a career had she not let her late husband	 John	 take over as her director. It's a real shame	 no really	 with the right direction and the right part (see ""10"")	 Bo was okay. She wouldn't win any awards even at her best	 but she is no worse than many an actress who has made it big in the past 15 years or so based on looks alone. But therein lay the problem	 John was determined to ride the wave that Bo created with her appearance in 10	 that of Bo being the ""perfect 10	"" ""the hottest woman in America	"" ""the sex symbol of the 1980s."" Problem is	 in John's hands	 this wave crashed with a resounding thud in only a few year's time. Maybe he knew her limitations as an actress	 perhaps that is why he fashioned movies for her that concentrated on her body	 not her acting skills. But it got old real quick. It didn't help matters any that the films of John and Bo Derek are (let's be honest) really	 really bad. And bad sums up their take on Edgar Rice Burrough's literary icon	 the Lord of the Jungle	 Tarzan of the Apes.<br /><br />You know what's worst? This film is boring! Make me laugh	 make me cry	 just don't bore me. Not even Bo's stunning looks and figure can rouse any interest	 and that is what the film is of course built around. Richard Harris (God bless his soul	 he and Bo were previously in Orca btw) hams it up and makes his scenes at least a little interesting and Miles O'Keefe makes a physically impressive Tarzan. Maybe he got the last laugh	 after being hit with a ton of venom from the critics over this film	 Miles went on to a solid career as a B movie icon	 in films that were not great art	 but a million times more fun than this one. But other than that	 it's Bo's body	and you can only see it so many times before you long for something else to go with it. Tarzan the Ape Man has nothing else. John Derek was a truly dynamic actor	 he was not a director. He should have stayed with his strength. This film unfolds at a mind numbingly slow pace and nothing really happens in the action scenes. Burrough's Tarzan was all about excitement and wish fulfillment (who wouldn't want to be as agile	 strong and good looking as Lord Greystoke?) and fun! You get none of that here. Watch it	 and you will have wasted 107 minutes of your life. On second thought	 you may come away with a valuable lesson	 how not to handle someone's movie career. <br /><br />Bo Derek is all right in my book though. She stood by John until his dying day	 has a true love of animals and nature and even looks back with a giggle at her time in the spotlight. She has also proven that she is not the dumb blonde many want her to make her out to be. If she could survive Tarzan and Bolero	 she can survive anything. So come back Bo	 all is forgiven.<br /><br />And as an aside	 is the Steve Strong who plays the bad guy the same Steve Strong who a brief pro wrestling career?"	0.0

"To some	 this Biblical film is a story of judgment and condemnation... Others see it as a story of grace	 restoration	 and hope... It is actually both  Henry King illustrates the portrait of a mighty monarch almost destroyed by his passion	 his downward spiral of sin	 and his upward climb of healing..<br /><br />'David and Bathsheba' is an emotional movie full of vividly memorable characters who attain mythic status while retaining their humanity... Henry King handles the powerful story	 taken from the Old Testament	 with skill...<br /><br />David	 'the lion of Judah	' having stormed the walls of Rabgah	 saves the life of one of his faithful warriors Uriah (Kieron Moore)	 and returns to Jerusalem... <br /><br />Back at his court	 his first wife complains of neglect	 and offends him for being a shepherd's son	 distinguishing herself for being the daughter of King Saul...<br /><br />One evening	 and while walking on the terrace of his palace which evidently held a commanding view of the neighborhood	 David's eyes happened to alight upon a young lady who was taking a refreshing bath... She was beautiful and attractive... David could not take his eyes off her... He finds out later on that she was the wife of one of his officers... <br /><br />Sending for her	 he discovers that she	 too	 is unhappy in her marriage... By this point	 it's apparent that David's intentions shift from an interest in taking Bathsheba as a wife	 to just plain taking Bathsheba... As usual	 sin had its consequences	 and David hadn't planned on that possibility...<br /><br />When a drought sweeps the land and there is a threat of famine	 David suspects that the Lord is punishing him and his people for his sin... But when Bathsheba tells him that she is pregnant and fears that she may be stoned to death according to the law of Moses	 David tries to cover up his sin... <br /><br />He sends word to Joab	 the commander of his army	 and ordered him to send to him Bathsheba's husband... David did something that was abominable in God's sight... He sends the man to the front line where he would be killed... <br /><br />The soldier is indeed killed and with him out of the way	 David marries his beloved Bathsheba in full regal splendor...<br /><br />God punishes the couple when Bathsheba's child dies soon after birth... Meanwhile	 a mighty famine has spread throughout the land and the Israelites - led by Nathan - blame the King for their plight... They storm the palace and demand that Bathsheba pays for her sin...<br /><br />Peck plays the compassionate king whose lustful desire outweighed his good sense and integrity.. <br /><br />Hayward as Bathsheba	 is a sensitive woman who begins to believe that every disaster occurring in her life is the direct result of her adultery... The sequence of her bath which could have been a great moment in Biblical film history	 is badly mishandled	 and the viewers eyes are led briefly to Hayward's face and shoulders...<br /><br />Raymond Massey appeared as Nathan the Prophet	 sent by God to rebuke David after his adultery with Bathsheba; Gwyneth Verdon is Queen Michal who tries to resist the ambition and greed that have become integral to David's personality and kingship; ex-silent screen idol	 Francis X. Bushman	 had a brief part as King Saul... <br /><br />The best moments of the film were: The Ark en route to its permanent home when God breaks a young soldier who tries to touch the sacred object; the defining moment in David's life when he confesses his sin and is prepared to accept his punishment of death; and for the film's climax	 inserting it as a flashback	 David remembering his fight with the giant Goliath... <br /><br />With superb color photography and a masterly music score	 'David and Bathsheba' won Oscar nominations in the following categories: Music Scoring	 Art and Set Direction	 Cinematography	 Story and Screenplay	 and Costume Design.."	1.0

They should make this the official and only true real Hamlet -movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being overshadowed by Kenneth Branagh's ""Hamlet"".<br /><br />It's a perfect	 complete version of the play	 potent	 massive	 earthshaking first-class masterpiece Shakespeare would have been proud of. They've packed over a dozen of world-famous top actors in the same film and everyone of them is having one of the greatest performances of their career. Every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of satisfaction.<br /><br />The cameras embrace gracefully the enchanting coulisses. Branagh is phenomenal in the leading role. His sharp	 irresistible performance is the only one of it's kind and will be permanently part of the glorious movie history. Every second in this presentation is feast for the movie lover from beginning to the very end. Branagh's version of ""Hamlet"" is among the ten best motion pictures ever."	1.0
"Kenneth Branagh attempts to turn William Shakspeare's obscure	 rarely-produced comedy into a 1930s-era musical	 with the result being both bad Shakespeare and bad musical comedy as the actors are rarely adept at one or the other of the two styles and in some cases flounder badly in both. Particularly painful is Nathan Lane	 who seems to be under the impression that he is absolutely hysterical as Costard but is badly mistaken	 and Alicia Silverstone who handles the Shakespearean language with all the authority of a teenaged Valley Girl who is reading the script aloud in her middle school English class.<br /><br />The musical numbers are staged with the expertise of a high school production of ""Dames at Sea	"" leaving the cast looking awkward and amateurish while singing and dancing	 with the lone exception being Adrian Lester who proves himself a splendid song and dance man. The only other saving grace of the film are Natascha McElhone and Emily Mortimer's contribution as eye candy	 but they have given far better performances than in this film and you'd be wise to check out some of the other titles in their filmographies and gives this witless mess a pass."	0.0
"I was really impressed with this film. The writing was fantastic	 and the characters were all rich	 and simple. It's very easy to get emotionally attached to all of them. The creators of this movie really hit the nail right on the head when it comes to creating real life characters	 and getting the viewer sucked right into their world. Further	 the music is terrific. They employed some independents to do the score	 and some of the soundtrack	 and they do a fantastic job adding to the movie. If you have a chance to catch this movie in a small theater or at a film festival (like I did)	 I highly recommend that you go see it. Also	 on a personal note	 Paget Brewster is beautiful in this movie. That's reason enough to go check it out."	1.0
"If I'm going to watch a porn movie	 I prefer it to have some sort of plot	 and a descent dialogue. Behind Bedroom Doors is one of the few I've come across with those attributes.<br /><br />The new girl next door scams on the neighbor's human nature and weaknesses where seduction and sex concerned. Chelsea Blue	(I mean Brooke LaVelle) is the choice actress to play the part of the blackmailing seductress	 and plays the part magnificently. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress. The movie get's an overall 10 just because she is in it. Her partner in the movie	 Monique Alexander is a definite cutie. The two should do more work together. In this movie	 though	 Monique	 who plays Gigi	 doesn't have a whole lot to do or say. That's too bad. She seems like she has more talent to be shared. I like the girl who was the (possible) DA's wife next. I forget her name	 but she's pretty good looking	 and not a bad actress. Nicole Sheridan...I'm still trying to figure out what some people are so excited about. It's obvious there are parts of her bought an paid for. Which is okay	 but is she finished? Sorry	 but come on! I'm afraid her performance here would have dropped the rating some	 except Chelsea's talent and beauty overrides any negatives. Overall	 This movie is a good one."	1.0

"Saw it yesterday night at the Midnight Slam of the Festival des films du Monde in Montreal. What a disappointment. This movie is clearly over rated by IMDb fans. The acting was only but regular. The directing didn't bring anything new or interesting. The plot lacks considerably : the movie is all about those college grads and the game they play making prank calls(7eventy 5ive). And on top of that	 you can predict the movie's end in the first five minutes. If you like prank calls and a slasher with an axe that makes you jump only once or twice during the whole movie	 you might like it. If you don't	 this movie is not worth it."	0.0
"Some wonder why there weren't anymore Mrs. Murphy movies after this one. Will it's because this movie totally blew snot. Disney was not the right studio to run this film. MAYBE Touchstone (well	 they're owned by Disney	 but it'd be more adult). The film is too kid-ish	 as the book series is not. The casting is all wrong for the characters. The characters don't even act the way they do in the books. And why was Tucker changed to a guy? He's a girl in the frigging books! Was this done to make the film appeal to boys? Sheesh. And where was Pewter	 the gray cat? One of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer	 but letting Disney blow her work was wrong. An animated feature film	 perhaps in the vane of Don Bluth's artwork would suit a better Mrs. Murphy film. Overall	 I give this a 2	 because at least Disney made a film from an under-appreciated book series. But	 I wish they did better. Either way	 I still have my books to entertain me."	0.0
"when you add up all the aspects from the movie---the dancing	 singing	 acting---the only one who stands out as the best in the cast is Vanessa Williams...her dedication	 energy and timeless beauty make Rosie the perfect role for her. Never have i ever seen someone portray Rose with such vibrancy! Vanessa's singing talent shows beautifully with all the songs she performs as Rose and her acting skills never cease to amaze me! Her dancing is so incredible	 even if as some people say the choreography was bad---her dancing skills were displayed better than ever before! I'd recommend this version over the '63 just because i find that although lengthy the acting by Vanessa is superb-----not to mention the fact that Jason Alexander and the rest of the cast are very impressive as well (with the exception of Chynna Philips...what in hell were they thinking when they cast her?)<br /><br />All in all I'd say this version is wonderful and I recommend that everyone see this version!"	1.0
"I'm a huge Steven Seagal fan. Hell	 I probably weigh as much as he does although I don't have the street cred to sport the frizzy-mullet-ponytail. Having stated my own bias and affection for America's favorite corpulent stage and screen hero	 it is with a heavy heart that I must declare this to be his worst movie ever. I'm not sure he could make a movie any worse than this.<br /><br />In his defense the major problems with this film seem to occur in post-production. It's painfully obvious that this movie was supposed to have a different storyline. That results in woeful voiceovers in which Steve's voice doesn't nearly sync up with that of the dubbed voice. The editing is pisspoor and overall this starts bad	 gets even worse	 and by the end you'll wish you had rewatched The Da Vinci Code instead. Yes	 it's that bad.<br /><br />After this I don't know what to expect from Steve. My friends still laugh at me for listening to his CDs. Is it time I start checking out some of the Van Damme direct to DVD nutty logs? If you are tempted to watch this movie	 rip your eyeballs out and flush them down the toilet. A lifetime of darkness is better than 89 minutes of this."	0.0
"John Cassavetes' 1977 film Opening Night is	 what critics usually call the work of such a significant artist	 'overlooked'. It is an excellent film	 in its own right	 and one of the best portraits of a midlife crisis ever put to film. It's not a perfect film	 in that	 at two hours and twenty four minutes it's about a half hour too long	 and there's a bit too much emphasis on the drunkenness of the lead character Myrtle Gordon	 played by Gena Rowlands	 the wife of Cassavetes	 long after we've gotten the point. But only Woody Allen's masterpiece	 Another Woman	 which also starred Rowlands	 eleven years later	 is a better portrait of the internal conflicts of an aging woman. Yet	 Rowlands did win the Best Actress Award at the Berlin Film Festival for this portrayal	 and it was well deserved. Often this film	 written by Cassavetes	 is easily compared to his earlier- and inferior- film	 A Woman Under The Influence	 but it's a spurious comparison. Rowlands' character in that film is severely mentally disturbed from the start	 as well as coming from a blue collar background	 while her characters in this film and in Allen's film are both artists who are haunted by apparitions. In this film it's the ghost of a dead young woman who can be seen as Myrtle's younger doppelganger	 while in Allen's film it's her character's own past . Many critics have taken this film to be a portrait of an alcoholic	 seeing Myrtle surround herself with enablers	 such as a stage manager who tells her	 during opening night	 'I've seen a lot of drunks in my time	 but I've never seen anyone as drunk as you who could stand up. You're great!'	 but this is wrong	 for alcohol isn't her problem- nor is her chain smoking. They are merely diversions from whatever thing is really compelling her to her own destruction	 and much to Cassavetes' credit	 as a storyteller	 he never lets us find out exactly what's wrong with Myrtle	 and despite her coming through in the end	 there's no reason to expect that she has really resolved anything of consequence. This sort of end without resolution links Cassavetes directly with the more daring European directors of the recent past	 who were comfortable in not revealing everything to an audience	 and forcing their viewers to cogitate	 even if it hurts.<br /><br />Yet	 the film recapitulates perfectly the effect of a drunk or fever lifting out of the fog	 and as such the viewer again is subliminally involved in its drama. Whether or not Myrtle Gordon does recover	 after the film's universe irises about her is left for each and every viewer to decide	 and as we have seen before that lid closes	 one's choices do matter."	1.0
"Just picked this up on DVD and watched it again. I love the bright colors vs. dark imagery. Not a big Beatty fan	 but this is an excellent popcorn movie. Pacino is astounding	 as always	 and well	 this movie marked the period where Madonna was her absolute sexiest. I wish she had stuck with the ""Breathless"" look for a while longer. Charlie Korsmo's first really big role	 other than ""What about bob?"". The makeup effects were cutting edge then and still hold up for the most part. Beautiful scenery and mood transport you directly into a comic strip environment. The cars	 wardrobe	 buildings	 and even the streetlights et a great tone	 not to mention the perfect lighting	 although the scenes with a lot of red can get a tad annoying	 as it tends to blur a little. Just wish Beatty had gotten the chance to make a sequel. All in all	 a fun few hours."	1.0
"Secret Sunshine (2007) is famous for its awards at the Festival de Cannes in 2007 and other film festivals. Jeon-Do Yeon	 who played the newly widowed Shin-ae	 won the best actress trophy at the 60th Cannes festival. Secret Sunshine was also a winner of best feature film and Jeon-Do Yeon received a best actress nod from Asia Pacific Screen Awards. In addition	 this movie won the best film awards in virtually all Korean film festivals. Masterfully written and directed	 and uniquely photographed	 Secret Sunshine expressed the hope and salvation that can be found when life is painful because of continuous tragedy. This film also talked about the forgiveness of God and people. Lee Chang Dong	 director and writer of this movie	 said in an interview	 ""In a vast sense	 I wanted to express what love is and this movie could be a melodrama in a sense. Without love	 we can't talk about hope and salvation."" Lee acknowledged that Secret Sunshine had no apparent genre. This movie is not a movie about religion	 but it drew attention from many Christians in Korea because there were a lot of Christian elements in the movie.<br /><br />The turning point in Secret Sunshine comes when Jun	 Shin-ae's son	 is kidnapped and killed. The kidnapper asks for money because he presumes that since she can buy land	 she must be rich. Her lie causes much sorrow.<br /><br />Shin-ae becomes a church-goer and wants to forgive the murderer. She decides to visit her son's murderer in prison and forgive him. Jong-chan	 Shin-ae's guy friend	 says	 ""Just forgive in your heart. Do you have to go to the prison?"" Her church fellows cheer for her and say they will pray for her. Her pastor agrees with what she wants to do. That is a sad moment because it is too early for her to do an action. The result of the meeting with the murderer is another turning point in Shin-ae's life. The murderer says with a peaceful smile that he has already been forgiven by God. This sparks anger in her toward God. She says	 ""How could You forgive the man before I forgive?"" <br /><br />She begins to fight against God. She looks up to the sky and proclaims	 ""I won't lose to You."" She becomes a snare	 her heart is a trap	 and her hands are chains. It is more bitter than death. She becomes crazier and crazier and is sent to a mental hospital. On the day Shin-ae is discharged from the hospital	 she goes to a beauty shop and sees a familiar face. The daughter of her son's murderer works in the shop and cuts her hair. The murderer's daughter has helped kidnapped Shin-ae's son. While she cuts Shin-ae's hair	 the protagonist can't understand what's going on and gets out of the shop quickly.<br /><br />It is difficult not to talk about Jong-chan in the movie. Jong-chan does his best to be by Shin-ae's side. Although Shin-ae doesn't care about him at all	 he is beside her all the time. Shin-ae leaves church quickly	 but Jong-chan	 who started attending church because of Shin-ae	 stays there because he feels peace with God. Lee Chang-dong	 the director of Secret Sunshine	 says that Jong-chan is like Milyang( secret sunshine)	 the rural city or vice versa. He seems to ""be too secular and frivolous	 but he is always two steps behind her and takes care of her. Milyang is like him."" Mr. Lee adds	 ""Someone joked that Jong-chan could be an angel. I think that he could be the angel. Who knows? We can't say for sure that there is no angel."" If there is a person like Jong-chan who forever accompanies his lover's twists and turns	 we can defend ourselves against the overpowered. The life of Shin-ae is full of meaninglessness. Her husband died after he cheated on her	 and her only son was killed cruelly by a murderer after she moved to her husband's hometown. And her soul was damaged because she learned Christianity in a wrong wayand that makes her crazy	 literally. It is too easy to say that her life is filled with meaninglessness. Does she still have hope in her life? Can she find meaning in her life? The final scene gives us hope. Shin-ae tries to cut her hair by herself: we walk our life's journey by ourselves. She	 however	 realizes that it is hard to do it by herself	 and we know that we can't do everything by ourselves. We see Jong-chan holding the mirror for her while she cuts her hair. That's her hope. She has Jong-chan beside her and he is willing to help her in whatever situation she is. As I mentioned earlier	 Jong-chan is like an angel for her. If we feel that an angel is always beside and behind us	 we can find joy in life even though we face adversity in our lives. <br /><br />Secret Sunshine was a hot topic of conversation in Korea. It is like Da Vinci Code. While Da Vinci Code helps us discuss the early church history	 Secret Sunshine prompts us to deal with life's messiness and find meaning when life seems unbearable. With a shallow interpretation of the movie	 people misunderstand Christianity and its theology. With a deeper interpretation	 this movie will help us see beneath the surface. Some people say they quit attending church worship service after they watched Secret Sunshine	 and Lee Chang-dong responds by saying	 ""They were already anti-Christ before they watched this movie. Secret Sunshine is a life story of a woman and we can interpret our life through Shin-ae's life."	1.0
"What a great gem this is. It's an unusual story that is fun to watch. Yes	 it has singing	 but it is very nicely crafted into the story and is very melodic to hear. It was so pleasant to watch; I enjoyed it from start to finish! <br /><br />The movie takes place in England during World War II. It is about an apprentice witch who is searching for a missing portion of a spell that she needs. She uses her rough ""magic"" to transport her and 3 children under her care to various destinations to find it. They are joined by her correspondence teacher	 who is surprised to learn that the lessons from his school actually work! <br /><br />Although the special effects may seem a little dated at first	 once you get used to them they become part of the charm of this movie. In fact	 the movie won an Oscar for these effects! <br /><br />The movie is innocent and fun - and it's hard not to like the tuneful songs. The characters are wonderfully interesting to watch. I think anyone at any age could find something to like about this movie."	1.0
"We have high expectations with this one . . . because its Zombi 3 the official sequel to Zombi 2 and directed by Lucio Fulci . . . however . . . its co-directed by Bruno Mattei (from Night of the Zombies) and not written by Dardino Sachetti but by Claudio Fagrasso (Night of the Zombies) and its shot in the Phillimines like Night of the Zombies and resembles Night of the Zombies (Hell of the Living Dead) a lot. as a result its more like a companion to Hell of the Living Dead than Zombi 2. Fabrazio DeAngelis who produced Zombi 2 and its editor Tomassi (?) and efx gianetto De Rossi gave Zombi 2 its magic . . . Zombi 3 is not magical . . . its like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the peanut-butter. But over the years	 I've grown to accept Zombi 3. I could swear I saw a version where a soldier was bitten on the arm and went to the hotel room . . . there was a senseless Fulci-cut and the Mattei/Fulci-cut is the one on DVD."	1.0

"If you have ever seen a movie by Brian Avenet-Bradley and compares it to the feedbacks it gets on IMDb	 you know that most of the comments and votes are faked. TRUST ME: you will be bored! People of the production team write their feedback themselves (sometimes they even admit it). But that's not enough: They also click constantly ""no"" whenever there is a negative comment on the movie. That's why negative critics are always placed behind the hyped ones.<br /><br />The movie itself is bad	 bad	 bad: bad acting	 bad lighting	 bad script	 bad ending. Believe me now! If not	 you will believe me later!<br /><br />Brian Avenet-Bradley might be quite a good business man. Otherwise it cannot be explained that he finds people who still finance his movies. (Okay	 they are cheap	 but nevertheless.) But as a creative person	 he is a complete failure."	0.0
"I finally got myself set up on mail order DVD rental so I could find movies not available to me in the stores. I chose The Souler Opposite because I love Christopher Meloni	 and also like small	 often ignored films.<br /><br />This one is such a treat! Meloni has such charm in this part. It's easy to pigeon hole him is you only ever see him as his alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this film	 Meloni is an out of step unattached mid-lifer who is hitting the skids in many ways	 only to find a path to happiness in someone unexpected.<br /><br />The relationship drawn between Barry (Meloni) and Tim Busfield's character is realistic and not over done. I haven't seen Busfield since 30something	 and he was fun to watch. But it was all Chris' film. I became such a fan girl all over again.<br /><br />It is a bit slow in the beginning	 I will admit. I thought some of the ""flashbacks"" could have been edited down. But overall	 this film will delight you - male or female - as it has an honest	 refreshing view of relationships today."	1.0
"Film critics of the world	 I apologize. It is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on. But I ignored your advice and I have been deeply hurt. However	 my decision to see ""The Cat in the Hat"" wasn't made haphazardly. You see	 three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the ""calamity"" known as ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"". Then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful	 funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat. So when the critics unleashed their fury against ""The Cat in the Hat""	 another big budget Seuss update with a big name star in the title role	 I thought that it must be the same old song. How wrong I was.<br /><br />For five whole minutes I thought I was in the clear. The opening credits are clever	 the kids are charming and the production values are top notch. Then the cat showed up. There are many problems from this point on	 but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of Mike Myers. Where ""The Grinch"" was saved by the inspired casting of Jim Carrey	 ""The Cat"" was destroyed by Myers. He can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong	 comic sketches. Every movie he's made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch	 from ""Wayne's World"" to ""Austin Powers"". So he tries to do the same thing here	 it's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of SNL	 not funny	 just painful. Not that the writers helped him out any. After the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags	 poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor. This movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience I have ever had. Period. So much talent and work went into something so vile. I know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess	 I just hope that the wonderful Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies. If you are a parent	 please avoid this like the plague. With movies like ""Elf"" and ""Brother Bear"" currently in theaters	 you have far better choices."	0.0
"The ""movie aimed at adults"" is a rare thing these days	 but Moonstruck does it well	 and is still a better than average movie	 which is aging very well. Although it's comic moments aim lower than the rest of it	 the movie has a wonderful specificity (Italians in Brooklyn) that isn't used to shortchange the characters or the viewers. (i.e. Mobsters never appear in acomplication. It never becomes grotesque like My Big Fat Greek Wedding) The secondary story lines are economically told with short scenes that allow a break from the major thread. These are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary movies where their immediate value cannot be impressed upon producers and bigwigs. I miss these scenes. It also beautifully involves older characters. The movie takes it's own slight	 quiet path to a conclusion. There isn't a poorly written scene included anywhere to make some executives sphincter relax. Cage and Cher do very nice work.<br /><br />Moonstruck invokes old-school	 ethnic	 workaday New York much like 'Marty' except Moonstruck is way less sanctimonious."	1.0
"I read somewhere that Hollywood should concentrate on remaking bad movies and leave the classics alone. We can only hope. While this remake wasn't a total waste	 I still wish I had the six bucks back to go toward a DVD of the original. Lots of violence and one of the worst endings I've ever seen. This version doesn't add anything new. It only reiterates why Hollywood should leave the good stuff alone."	0.0
"Of the three titles from Jess Franco to find their way onto the Official DPP Video Nasty list (Devil Hunter	 Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars) this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety	 being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore	 a gratuitous rape scene	 and loads of nudity.<br /><br />Gorgeous blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays movie star Laura Crawford who is abducted by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the 'devil god' that lurks in the jungle (a big	 naked	 bulging-eyed native who likes to eat the hearts of nubile female sacrifices).<br /><br />Employed by Laura's agent to deliver a $6million ransom	 brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his Vietnam vet pilot pal travel to the island	 but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a double-cross. During the confusion	 Laura escapes into the jungle	 but runs straight into the arms of the island's natives	 who offer her up to their god.<br /><br />Franco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks: crap gore	 murky cinematography	 rapid zooms	 numerous crotch shots	 out of focus imagery	 awful sound effects	 and ham-fisted editing. The result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish (It took me a couple of sittings to finish the thing)	 and even the sight of the luscious Buchfellner in all of her natural glory ain't enough to make me revisit this film in a hurry."	0.0
"**SPOILERS** Since the disappearance at sea of her favorite niece Phyllis murder mystery writer Abigail Mitchell	 Ruth Gordon	 has strong suspicions that it was Phyllis' husband Edmund Galvin	 Charles Frank	 who was responsible for her death. In fact Abigail is convinced that he murdered her and made it look like a tragic accident.<br /><br />Knowing that there's no evidence to have Edmund arrested for Phyillis' death and deciding to take the law into her own hands Abigail cooks up this elaborate plan to do him in and make it look	 like Phyllis' death	 a tragic accident. Getting Edmund to secretly come over to her mansion to give him the combination to her walk-in safe	 as she's about to leave on vacation for New York City	 Abigail tricks him into going inside locking the startled and surprised Edmund in. With the safe being soundproof nobody at the mansion the butler maid and Abigail's personal secretary Veronica	 Mariette Hartley	 hear him screaming for help and the next day Edmund is found suffocated to death. Veronica discovered Edmund's body as she was about to put away	 for safe keeping	 Abigail's latest murder mystery manuscript.<br /><br />Lt. Columbo	 Peter Falk	 is called on the case involving the strange death of Edmund Garvin to determine if it's a murder or a tragic accident. Going through Edmund's apartment Columbo is puzzled to find out that he doesn't have a single photo of his late wife	 who's been missing for just a month! This ties into what Abigail always felt about him in Edmund not being in love with Phyllis and also a suspect in her	 in Abigail's mind	 murder. <br /><br />Columbo a big fan	 together with his wife	 of Abigail's murder mystery novels has a hard time realizing that she in fact was responsible for Edmund's death. All the evidence points to Abigil including a pair of missing car keys that was Edmunds. This all proved that Abgail was in fact in the house	 not on her way to the airport	 when Edmund was locked inside the walk-in safe.<br /><br />Going through all the evidence Columbo comes up with this strange conclusion that Edmund must have left some evidence inside the safe in writing to who his killer is. That conclusion is quickly checkmated when it's found out that Edmund didn't even have a pen or pencil as well as light	 with the safe light-bulb burned out	 on him to write it. There's also something very odd that's inside the safe that has been on Lt. Columbo's mind ever since he came on the case. This has to do with the black paint residue that was found under the dead Edmund's fingernails and on his belt buckle! <br /><br />It's that evidence	 when put together with a number of other items in the safe	 that in the end hangs Edmund's murder on the tricky and very cunning mystery writer Abigail Mitchell. Edmund let Abigail unknowingly convict herself in his final attempt as the air in the safe was being used up	 by his breathing	 in using burnt out matchsticks to write on Abigail last manuscript who murdered him: Abigail Mitchell!"	1.0
"If you want Scream or anything like the big-studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother. This well-written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say. Importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense	 how children interpret the world (and the violence in it)	 our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends.. all here	 but not flatly on the surface. You could technically call it a ""monster movie"" even though the Wendigo does not take physical form until the end	 and then it's even up to you and your beliefs as to what's happening with the legendary spirit/beast. Some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores	 though in fact the less you see of the creature	 the better. Fessenden successfully continues George Romero's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out."	1.0
"This is a direct sequel to 'The Mummy's Hand' (1940)	 because the lead character	 Stephen Banning (played by Dick Foran) is now thirty years older and is relating the story (with the help of archival footage) to his son's fiancé. There are only two unusual aspects to the film: the early death of Banning	 and the presence of Turhan Bey.<br /><br />Lon Chaney as the mummy Kharis gets top billing	 though given the nature of his role	 he has little more to do than limp along or thrash his arms about. There's nothing scary about his presence	 except for his attempt to carry off the fiancé	 Isobel (Elyse Knox). Dick Foran gets second billing	 but he's killed off within the first fifteen minutes! We'd have to wait until 'Psycho' (1960) when a lead character (Janet Leigh) dies way before the end of the movie! Banning's buddy from the first film	 Babe Jenson (now Henson)	 shows up a little later looking much	 much	 older and not doing any of the comic shtick he did in the original. It's hard to believe it's the same actor! Unfortunately	 this great acting job is wasted because he gets killed by Kharis after only two brief scenes. It's then left up to Banning's son John (played by bit player John Hubbard) to led the chase to the cemetery--NO! The sheriff leads a torch wielding mob to Banning's house to burn it down and kill the mummy. Sound Universally familiar? <br /><br />Turhan Bey is introduced to audiences as the new High Priest	 Mehmet Bey	 to care for and feed tana leaves to Kharis. With his 'exotic' voice and appearance	 it's too bad he gets so easily killed. A better movie would have had 'Babe' take Von Helsing type charge of things in tracking down the mummy	 with a final decisive battle with him and Mehmet Bay. But instead we have a pedestrian rehash of different set pieces from previous Universal horror films	 put together by the hack Griffin Jay who wrote many of Universal's other clunkers	 although he also did 'Don Winslow of the Navy' (1942) as well as 'Don Winslow of the Coast Guard' (1943) which also featured Elyse Knox.<br /><br />Elyse Knox played Anne Howe in six Joe Palooka movies (1946-1949)	 and of course	 Turhan Bey	 with 43 movie and TV credits	 is great in the title role of 'The Amazing Dr. X' (1948).<br /><br />The cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric (with lots of noirish shadows in the sheriff's office) than the first 'Kharis' mummy film	 but there's little else of interest or excitement.<br /><br />I'll give it a 3."	0.0
"Yeah	 the poster is quite a horrible piece of work.<br /><br />I thought the movie was OK...nothing really outstanding...I just was hoping that he would be a hardcore druggie and totally trash his life.<br /><br />Ahh	 but that can't happen to rich kids now can it? Not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds big ballroom parties and has a nice manicured lawn on the front of the mini mansion.<br /><br />No...the kid is too good to have his life totally trashed. After all	 who will drive the brand new SUV and who will go to law school? <br /><br />Ah	 the poor little rich kids...in their quaint pretty house	 with their ivy league schools	 ultra clean homes and socialite parties...what will the world do without them? <br /><br />I hope they all get addicted to drugs	 pass-away their life and end up in jail...so maybe we can see movies that don't all revolve around the poor little rich boys and girls of the surreal world."	1.0
"If you want to watch something that is for 'him' and 'her' so to say then this is the film to pick. I am a sucker for rom coms but my husband is not always so keen (what a guy!!!). Anyway I managed to get him to watch it because I told him it was about sport	 and you know what	 he loved it!!!<br /><br />Drew Barrymore is very funny and her leading man (sorry but can't remember his name) is equally as good. When I watched the film it was called 'The Perfect Match' but I think the title was changed for the UK as it is based on the book Fever Pitch and there was already a film made about football with that title (the same film but the UK version - phew!)	<br /><br />Anyway all of the reviews on here will tell you more details if you need them buy girls	 take it from me	 get your hubby/boyfriend in front of the television on a Saturday night and you will both laugh and cry together. A real gem."	1.0
"I couldn't relate to this film. It failed to engage me either intellectually	 emotionally or aesthetically. The dialogue was very dense and uninvolving. I couldn't connect with and hence care about any of the characters and I'm finding it hard to find much that's positive to say about it.<br /><br />I've read that to understand it properly one needs to be familiar with some of the more obscure aspects of Catholic theology. I'll admit that	 as an atheist	 I probably am unfamiliar with many of the finer details of Catholicism	 but I have also seen many films dealing with religious issues that have touched me because their themes are still universal to the human condition and don't rely on specialised knowledge or beliefs."	0.0
"I've been watching ""Dick Tracy"" for years	 and as a result it's become a vital part of my life - it was with me throughout childhood and I used to see it quite often. Seeing it now	 as an adult	 it's still a very good movie - dark	 satiric and incredibly misunderstood. About the only thing that can be said is the Oscar nomination Pacino received - other than that it is rarely discussed and didn't make much of a fuss when it came out.<br /><br />Pacino is over-the-top but to good effect as he's clearly having loads of fun. Beatty is great as Dick Tracy and behind the camera manages to capture the atmosphere of a film noir comic book better than any other film	 possibly	 I have ever seen. Just taking a look at one scene from the film is breathtaking. The lighting	 velvet overtones and smog/smoke combine to create a great effect.<br /><br />There are some really funny cameos including one by Dustin Hoffman as ""Mumbles	"" and I don't think there are any flaws at all in terms of acting - even the mandatory kid-character is far better than expected.<br /><br />Overall	 a really fine movie that has become misunderstood over the years since its release and is incredibly underrated with only 5.7/10 average on IMDb. The critics' reviews are very positive (check out RottenTomatoes.com) and after seeing the film once again it's not hard to see why - this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book	 from style to eccentricity.<br /><br />Highly recommended. 4.5/5 stars."	1.0

"The two things are are good about this film are it's two unknown celebrities.<br /><br />First	 Daphne Zuniga	 in her first appearance in a film	 young and supple	 with looks that still encompass her body today	 steals the very beginning	 which is all she is in	 and that is that. She is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projects.<br /><br />Second	 the score by then known composer Christopher(Chris) Young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one star...yeah	 I know one star more is not much	 but in this movie's case	 it is a lot.<br /><br />The rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down	 getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer	 blah	 blah	 blah...we all know where this is going.<br /><br />Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga	 then turn it off."	0.0
"Corridors of time. The movie you can watch if you're looking for a sophisticated way of suicide. Some use guns	 ropes	 or gas	 but you want to ruin your brains ? Do not wait any longer ! Corridors of time is probably one of the biggest possible mistakes : thinking Christian Clavier is able to act and to bring you fun. I do not miss the 45 francs this poor thing cost me : sometimes	 one has to reset its evaluation system looking at the absolute zero. This film deserves a 2/10	 but that's only because I like Jean Reno. Too bad for him	 he also stars in Ronin. I think I'm gonna dislike him..."	0.0
"This is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic achievement. From the very start I was utterly hooked into the (true) story when Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) weeps while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. This then is the compelling story of Andrei Chikatilo	 wonderfully played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact	 he plays it so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost starts to pity him	 until we remember what he is. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky	 wonderfully played by Max Von Sydow was utterly believable in every detail	 and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union	 is made all too apparent by the behaviour of the local Communist Commissar Bondarchuk played by Joss Ackland. For me though	 the outstanding performance was from Donald Sutherland	 proving once again what a superb character actor he really is. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work. This film puts Silence of the Lambs into the shade	 from the atmospheric and bleak Soviet landscape	 to the superlative performances by everyone involved. <br /><br />I rate this film 10/10"	1.0
"This is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes	 THE MONEY PIT and ARE WE DONE YET?	 only points out all the more how the 40's movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since	 regretfully	 been lost.<br /><br />I was 15 when I first saw this and even at that tender age	 there was much I could laugh at. Now of course being familiar with adult frustrations	 I see a whole lot that I missed as a youth.<br /><br />The three main actors...Cary Grant	 Myrna Loy	 and Melvyn Douglas...interacted perfectly	 but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream. It's never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisions.<br /><br />All in all	 this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it."	1.0
"A young solicitor in sent to a remote area to wrap up the estate of a recently deceased client. When he arrives he finds that he is made less than welcome by the local villagers and that his deceased client was not liked. To speed things up he decides to move from the local inn and take up residence in her home	 a house that is usually fogbound and approached only by a causeway that is blocked off by the sea most of the day. Once there he sees visions of a woman in black	 is she real or imaginary	he is also subjected to the blood curdling cries of a woamn and child apparently drowning in the marshes	 these events take their toll on him and he soon becomes quite terrified. Atmospheric TV adaptation of a famous play by Susan Hill	 that spends it first third building up its characters	 before moving to the creepy country house	 its poor colour contrast give away its TV roots immediately	 this really should have been in black & white	 but still as a ghost story it had a couple of unsettling moments	 still though after waiting so long to see it I must say I was sadly just a little underwhelmed."	1.0
"Weak scripts at times? Yep! Cheesy special effects at times? Yep! Deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time? Yep! More about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yep! I always enjoyed science fiction as a kid	 but found so much of the Dracula/Frankenstein/Mummy/horror stuff as just so much crap. It took Abbott and Costello to give me a new perspective on the classic Universal monsters	 and it took Carl Kolchak to win me over to the ""dark side"" of entertainment. The Duke had Rooster Cogburn	 Eastwood had Dirty Harry	 Garner had Maverick and Rockford	 Selleck had Magnum	 and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak. Mixed in with all those weak scripts	 cheesy special effects	 that baroque group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars	 there was Darren McGavin as Carl Kolchak. He had a wry sense of humor in spite of the danger	 was an idealist in his pursuit of the truth	 and a realist when it came to accepting the obligatory incompetence and eventual cover-up by government officials. Additionally	 unlike 98% of us	 Kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done	 even if it meant his demise	 the end of his journalistic career	 or jail time. For all his faults	 including no taste in clothes	 Carl Kolchak was a man of charm and wit who drove a beautiful classic yellow Mustang (which was an old used car at the time) on his way to save the day for humanity. As good as any other fictional hero Carl Kolchak was the everyman hero brought to life every week for one season thanks to Darren McGavin. Now that he's passed on and his show is on DVD	 I hope he's having as much fun watching me watch him have fun playing Kolchak The Night Stalker all over again!"	1.0
"There's a good reason that Walter Pidgeon is warning off Leslie Nielson and his crew from the relief ship	 stuff he dare not dream about.<br /><br />As Doctor Edward Morbius	 Pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier. Since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter	 Anne Francis. They are the only humans left on this planet which was once the home world of an ancient civilization known as the Krell.<br /><br />The records as deciphered by Pidgeon indicate the Krell came to a cataclysmic ending of unknown origin. The machinery they left behind is still functioning.<br /><br />Maybe functioning too well as members of the relief party start dying and in a particular gruesome fashion. <br /><br />I see all kinds of speculation about a remake and this is one film not to remake because it's as fresh as it was in 1956. The terms would change	 we would now say warp speed instead of hyper drive	 courtesy of the enduring popularity of Star Trek.<br /><br />We might not see the men in the relief expedition in a flying saucer like space ship. It might look a lot more like the Starship Enterprise or the Ship from 2001 A Space Odyssey. It's interesting to look at science fiction films from different generations and see how are conceptions of the future do change.<br /><br />The story behind Forbidden Planet is a timeless one	 about mortal beings trying to play God.<br /><br />You can't write about Forbidden Planet without commenting on Robby the Robot. This mechanical marvel	 put together by Pidgeon with the knowledge he gained from studying the Krell was quite the hit back in the day. He got a new lease on life in the sixties with the character of the Robot from Lost In Space. His scenes with Earl Holliman who plays the cook on the space ship and his complying with Earl's request for some home spirits are very funny.<br /><br />Robby and the other special effects were nominated for an Oscar	 but lost to The Ten Commandments and the parting of the Red Sea. Forbidden Planet's bad luck to run up against a Hollywood founder like Cecil B. DeMille.<br /><br />Classicists among you will recognize Forbidden Planet as a futuristic reworking of The Tempest which when you think about it could have been Shakespeare's one venture into science fiction. <br /><br />My favorite among the cast is Warren Stevens who's sacrifice enables Leslie Nielsen to learn exactly what he's dealing with.<br /><br />Never miss this one whenever it's broadcast."	1.0
"A recent post here by a woman claiming a military background	 contained the comment ""A woman's life is no more valuable than a man's"".<br /><br />This mantra of the politically correct is not true as history as well as biology show. Societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population	 sometimes with astonishing speed. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914- 1918 war in which over two million of her men were killed. In South America's War of the Triple Alliance (1865)	 Paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the 1932 Chaco War against much larger Bolivia.<br /><br />No society	 however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population. Only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight. Israel faced that situation in 1948 but since then has never considered coed combat units for its Defense Forces despite the popular image of the Israeli girl soldier.<br /><br />""G.I. Jane"" is Hollywood fluff."	0.0
"When I read MOST of the other comments	 I felt they were way too glowing for this movie. I found it had completely lost the spark found in the earlier Zatoichi movies and just goes to prove that after a long absence from the screen	 it's often best to just let things be. I completely agreed with the Star Trek analogy from another reviewer who compared the FIRST Star Trek movie to the original series---millions of excited fans were waiting and waiting and waiting for the return of the show and were forced to watch a bland and sterile approximation of the original.<br /><br />The plot is at times incomprehensible	 it is terribly gory (though the recent NEW Zatoichi by Beat Takeshi is much bloodier) and lacks the heart of the originals. I didn't mind the blood at all	 but some may be turned off by it (particularly the scenes with the severed nose and the severed heads). In addition	 time has not been good to Ichi--he seems a broken and sad man in this film (much	 much more than usual)--and that's something fans of the series may not really want to see.<br /><br />This was a very sorry return for Zatoichi. Unless you are like me and want to see EVERY Zatoichi film	 this one is very skipable. See one of the earlier versions or the 2003 ALL-NEW version."	0.0
"I have seen a couple movies on eating disorders but this one was definitely my favorite one. The problem with the other ones was that the people with the eating disorders towards the end just automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help and thats it. this movie I thought was more realistic cause in this one the main character Lexi doesn't automatically just get better. She gets better and then has a drawback. I think this movie shows more than the others that I've seen that getting better doesn't just happen	 it's hard work and takes time	 it's a long path to recovery. I think this movie shows all of that very well. There should be more movies like this."	1.0
"PROM NIGHT (2008)<br /><br />directed by: Nelson McCormick<br /><br />starring: Brittany Snow	 Scott Porter	 Jessica Stroup	 and Dana Davis<br /><br />plot: Three years ago	 Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher (Jonathan Schaech) who has a bit of a crush on her. Now	 she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends. Once there	 they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn Donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt. <br /><br />pros: I got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves.<br /><br />An example:<br /><br />Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her (she doesn't seem that great) has escaped from prison. Their reason: They don't want to embarrass her in front of all her friends. LOL<br /><br />cons: Let me start off by saying I'm a huge slasher fan. Usually I can have fun with even the bad ones. I even like some PG-13 horror films. TOURIST TRAP (1979)	 one of my favorites	 was originally rated PG. I also enjoy POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated PG-13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie.<br /><br />First of all	 I had a big problem with the story. I like slasher films that don't even have stories. At least they can be entertaining. This is about a teacher who falls in love with his student	 so he kills her entire family. A few years later	 he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends ...? Then there were subplots that I doubt anyone cared about. Claire (Jessica Stroup) is fighting with her boyfriend	 she has cramps	 and I couldn't care less. This should have been a Lifetime feature	 not a remake of PROM NIGHT. <br /><br />And then ... this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes. I don't even care that it's not that gory	 some of my favorite slashers (HALLOWEEN	 CURTAINS	 the original PROM NIGHT) were not that gory but they still had effective murders. Here	 we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen	 a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds	 and a closeup on a bad actor's face as he screams in agony. I'm sure that 10 year-old girls were terrified	 but not me.<br /><br />I also hated the characters. There was Donna's unrealistically sensitive boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and I can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life	 unless you are a gay male. Then we had Donna's annoying friends Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis)	 and the token mean girl Chrissy (Brianne Davis). If you thought the characters in DEATH PROOF were annoying	 try watching this movie. And don't get me started on Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and the DJ (Jay Phillips) who gave me flashbacks to Usher's performance in SHE'S ALL THAT.<br /><br />Add to all that predictable plot turns	 a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material	 and you have quite a stinker."	0.0
"MY LEFT FOOT	 in my opinion	 is a great biopic about one of the world's most talented authors and painters. The performances were smashing	 the soundtrack was great	 and the casting was perfect. I thought that Christy (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented man	 although I couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time. In addition	 when he threw a tantrum	 I got a little scared. Also	 it's just so sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy. In conclusion	 if you are a die-hard fan of Daniel Day-Lewis or like biopics	 I highly recommend this great biopic about one of the world's most talented authors and painters. You're in for a real treat and a good time	 so don't miss this one."	1.0
"Leonard Maltin compared this film to a Mel Brooks comedy. He was far too kind to Ms. Rivers	 and far too cruel to Mr. Brooks. Not even the raunchiest Mel Brooks films are this tasteless	 and at least they're genuinely funny. This picture deserves a place on the hundred-worst list."	0.0
"I would like to comment on the movie April Love. It's one of my all time favorites because my father	 Nelson Malone plays the horse trainer. I remember distinctly when Hollywood came to Lexington	 KY	 where we were living at the time to make April Love. My Dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man. I talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered	 and lo and behold he came home w/the script. How exciting is that! Also	 a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes -- especially the ones shown at the amusement park. It's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown once again	 and the song April Love by Pat Boone is still played on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today w/all the sex	 foul language and violence. It would be refreshing to see more movies like April Love come back into focus..."	1.0
"After watching a dozen episodes	 I decided to give up on this show since it depicts in an unrealistic manner what is mathematical modeling. In the episodes that Charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models	 I thought that my profession was being joked about. I am not a mathematician	 instead a chemical engineer	 but I do work a lot with mathematical models. So I will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to ""make-believe"" of fairy tales.<br /><br />First	 choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task. Charlie Eppes is shown as a genius	 but even him would have to spend considerable time researching for a suitable model	 specifically for trying to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future. Individuals are erratic and haphazard	 there is no modeling for them. Isaac Asimov even wrote about that in the 1950's. Even if there were a model for specific kind of individual	 it would be a probabilistic (stoichastic) one	 meaning it has good chance of making a wrong prediction.<br /><br />Second	 supposing the right model for someone or a situation is found	 the model parameters have to be known. These parameters are the constants of the equations	 such as the gravity acceleration (9.8 m/s2)	 and often are not easy to determine. Again	 Charlie Eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses. And after the model and the parameters are chosen	 they would have to be tested. Oddly	 they are not	 and by miracle	 they fit exactly the situation that is being predicted.<br /><br />Third	 a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected	 not only by Numbers	 but also by sci-fi movies: the computational effort required for solving these models. Try to make Excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find doing a Herculean job. Even if Charlie Eppes has the right software to solve his models	 he might be stuck with hardware that will be dreadfully slow. And even with the right software/hardware combination	 the model solution might well take days to be reached. He solves them immediately! I could use his computer in my research work	 I would be very glad.<br /><br />As a drama	 it is far from being the best show. The characters are somewhat stereotyped	 but not even remotely funny as those in Big Bang Theory are. The crimes are dull and the way Charlie Eppes solves them sometimes make the FBI look pretty incompetent.<br /><br />For some layman	 the show might work. For others	 the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow!"	0.0
"Xizao is a rare little movie. It is simple and undemanding	 and at the same time so rewarding in emotion and joy. The story is simple	 and the theme of old and new clashing is wonderfully introduced in the first scenes. This theme is the essence of the movie	 but it would have fallen flat if it wasn't for the magnificent characters and the actors portraying them.<br /><br />The aging patriarch	 Master Liu	 is a relic of China's pre-expansion days. He runs a bath house in an old neighbourhood. Every single scene set in the bath house is a source of jelaousy for us stressed out	 unhappy people. Not even hardened cynics can find any flaws in this wonderful setting.<br /><br />Master Liu's mentally handicapped son Er Ming is the second truly powerful character in the movie	 coupled with his modern-life brother. The interactions between these three people	 and the various visitors to the bath house	 are amazingly detailed and heart-felt	 with some scenes packing so much emotion it's beyond almost everything seen in movies.<br /><br />With its regime-critical message	 this movie was not only censored	 but also given unreasonably small coverage. It could be a coincidence	 but when a movie of this caliber is virtually impossible to find	 even on the internet(!)	 you can't help getting suspicious.<br /><br />So help free speech and the movie world	 buy	 rent	 copy this wonderful movie	 and if you happen to own the DVD	 if there even is one	 then share share share!"	1.0
"Again	 it seems totally illogical	 to me at least	 that ""Arthur"" merits a mere 6.4 out of 10 possible. Steve Gordon's one-shot masterpiece herein is the totally ""unlikely"" if not quite ""impossible"" melding of wildly disparate elements. That he managed to make alcoholism laugh-friendly rather than tearjerking tragic is	 in itself	 wonderful. That he gave Dudley Moore his finest role	 and every other cinematic element herein its optimal impact	 including the score	 seems to me patent and egregious. I challenge ANYone to sit through this film and not laugh out loud. But	 apparently	 nearly a third of its audience has so managed. Well	 I	 for one	 found and find Gordon's effort both laughable AND lovable	 and the iikes of Geraldine Fitzgerald's great-aunt and Stephen Elliott's murderous would-be father-in-law absolute gems of background characters. Even the black chauffeur managed to escape patronization	 and the late	 sniffish Sir John Gielgud was right about accepting his fee	 but wrong about undertaking his role. ""Arthur"" makes no effort to ""Underztand	"" much less rationalize	 the scourge of ""alcoholism"" (hey	 iFit ain't booze	 it's other drugs of choice	 including meth	 and addictions are merely symptoms	 not targets)	 it simply observes in its own quizzical manner."	1.0
"HOLLOW MAN is one of the better horror films of the past decade. The sub-plot is original and the main plot is even better. The special effects are brilliant and possibly the best I have ever seen in a horror film. Kevin Bacon proves again that he can handle any role that comes his way.<br /><br />Claude Rains shocked the world with THE INVISIBLE MAN in 1933	 well now	 Kevin Bacon has shocked *us* with HOLLOW MAN. One of the most thrilling horror films ever. The action is intense and the chills are true. You may actually find yourself jumping if you are watching it in the dark on a stormy night. The supporting cast includes Elizabeth Shue	 Josh Brolin	 Kim Dickens	 Joey Slotnick	 Greg Grunberg	 and Mary Randle. All of whom do an exceptional job. <br /><br />---SPOILERS---<br /><br />Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team have discovered the secret to making someone invisible. After animal testings	 they move on to human testing. But someone has to be the subject. Volenteering	 Caine is turned invisible. But when his team is unable to bring back into visibility	 Caine is driven mad by his condition as he seeks his revenge...*end spoilers*<br /><br />The film has created memorable shock sequences and is destined to become a classic well into the next century. Becoming the basis for a spoof joke in SCARY MOVIE 2	 this film grabs you by the throat and never lets go. The first 45 minutes or so are slow	 developing the characters and showing how their experiments work. The second half is exciting and appealing to most action and horror fans. Think of DEEP BLUE SEA. Then change the sharks into an crazy invisible man. And then change the water into fire and explosions. A rehashing of a killer shark movie. Interesting... HOLLOW MAN gets 5/5."	1.0
"I am a great fan of David Lynch and have everything that he's made on DVD except for Hotel Room & the 2 hour Twin Peaks movie. So	 when I found out about this	 I immediately grabbed it and...and...what IS this? It's a bunch of crudely drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and foul mouthed and unfunny. Maybe I don't know what's good	 but maybe this is just a bunch of crap that was foisted on the public under the name of David Lynch to make a few bucks	 too. Let me make it clear that I didn't care about the foul language part but had to keep adjusting the sound because my neighbors might have. All in all this is a highly disappointing release and may well have just been left in the deluxe box set as a curiosity. I highly recommend you don't spend your money on this. 2 out of 10."	0.0
"I'm a rather pedestrian person	 with somewhat lowbrow tastes. However	 I occasionally try to raise the bar on my cultural awareness. This movie was one of my attempts. I was in awe throughout the entire movie. I liked it so much that I got my own tape so I could see it again. This is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking movie. I saw it as a huge question to the viewer: What is the depth of sacrifice to duty one can accept	 can be asked to accept	 should accept? As a military member	 this is of course an important question to me. This question weighs heavily on the viewer of this movie.<br /><br />Recommended."	1.0
"This is the last time I rent a video without checking in at the IMDB reviews. The Limey is directed by Steven Soderbergh who also wrote wrote the truly awful Nightwatch with Ewan Macgregor and directed such trash as Out of Sight with the anti-talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a fine actor and it is a shame he involved himself in such a bad film. There is frequent confusing editing that seems like it was a last minute decision in order to make up for the lack or story	 filming and just plain common sense. This film does everything wrong.

"A truly	 truly dire Canadian-German co-production	 the ever-wonderful Rosanna Arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term ""problem child"" - a few uears prior to the ""action"" the child murdered her father	 and mum took the fall for the offspring. Now she's moved up to the Northwest US to start over	 but her child still has a problem in that she's devoted to her mother. So devoted in fact that she kills anyone who might be seen as a threat to their bond.<br /><br />Unfortunately Mandy Schaeffer (as the daughter) murders more than people - she delivers such a terrible performance that she also wipes out the movie	 though the incoherent script	 useless direction and appalling music (check out the saxophone the first time she displays her bikini-clad bod) don't help any; we're supposed to find her sexy and scary	 but she fails on both counts. Almost completely unalluring and not even bad enough to be amusing (not to mention the fact that Arquette and Schaeffer don't really convince as mother and daughter)	 all condolences to Miss Arquette and Jurgen Prochnow	 both of whom are worthy of far more than this	 and both of whom (particularly Rosanna) are the only sane reasons for anyone to sit through this farrago.<br /><br />One of the production companies is called Quality International Films - not since the three-hour ""Love	 Lies And Murder"" (from Two Short Productions) has there been such a ""You must be joking"" credit."	0.0
"Too bad a couple of comments before me don't know the facts of this case. It is based on actual events	 a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the Wilmington	 DE/Philadelphia PA region from '96 through 2000. I have to admit I was highly skeptical of how Hollywood would dramatize the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local newscasts and Philadelphia Inquirer news stories throughout the time period. Of course I immediately pointed out that the actress (who I really like in Cold Case) who played Fahey looked nothing like her (Anne Marie was actually prettier). I have to admit though that Mark Harmon really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as Capano's and the behavior that Capano exhibited throughout this period. Details of the case were right on...no deviations of dramatic effect...even down to the carpet	 gun	 furniture	 and cooler. In conclusion	 I also wanted to add that I have met Tom Carper many times at various functions (a good man	 despite being a politician) and I am so glad that he pulled the strings in the Federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime. Guys like Capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars."	1.0
"A note to all of you budding film writers: Study this film. If your dialog reads like the dialog in this film	 please shred your script and try again.<br /><br />I didn't have high expectations	 but was intrigued by the description indicating there was a mystery at the Christmas Ornament Factory. The Mystery is resolved very early and the film becomes a straight romance. I almost stopped watching it at 5 minutes	 10 minutes	 and at the first break. My spouse 	 who is the Hallmark & Lifetime fan	 gave up at the first break. <br /><br />Forest River is a company town - the main business is Aikens Ornaments	 who make all manner of holiday decorations.The patriarch of the company has recently passed away	 so the companies future might be in question. We soon meet Noelle	 who would rather be on Wall Street than Main Street	 and the mysterious Justin	 who gets a date with Noelle after a large snowman she is inflating crashes into Justins car. Once we meet Alison Aikens	 doing due diligence for the Board	 we have our story setup.<br /><br />If you can't nail all the story arcs by the first commercial break	 you haven't seen enough of this kind of Holiday film. Maybe that's a good thing."	0.0
"This is widely viewed in Australia as one of the best cop dramas ever produced here ... and for my money	 anywhere. It's raw	 gritty	 the characters are real	 the situations are believable and it doesn't shy away from the darker side of life confronted every day by cops and the criminals	 victims	 lawyers and other people in their various orbits.<br /><br />This show ran for 2 seasons and was discontinued because the show didn't sell well overseas. We are all sorry for its loss: however	 like Fawlty Towers	 we will be able to revere this as a limited-length series of uniformly high quality."	1.0
"This is the biggest insult to TMNT ever. Fortunantely	 officially Venus does not exist in canon TMNT. There will never be a female turtle	 this took away from the tragic tale of 4 male unique mutants who will never have a family of their own	 once gone no more. The biggest mistake was crossing over Power Rangers to TMNT with a horrible episode; the turtle's voices were WRONG and they all acted out of character. They could have done such a better job	 better designs and animatronics and NO VENUS. <br /><br />don't bother with this people...it's cringe worthy material. the lip flap was slow and unnatural looking. they totally disrespected shredder. the main baddie	 some dragonlord dude was corny. the turtles looked corny with things hanging off their bodies	 what's with the thing around raph's thigh? the silly looking sculpted plastrons!? <br /><br />If they looked normal	 acted in character and got rid of Venus	 got rid of the stupid kiddie cartoon sounds...and better writing it could have been good."	0.0
"In the voice over which begins the film	 Hughie(Billy Connolly)	 a roadie for the great 70's band Strange Fruit	 said the reason lightning struck at a rock festival to stop Strange Fruit's set was that God was sick of 70's excess. Indeed	 it's been popular to put down that era of music	 and see punk as a welcome antidote to it. While I agree the excess was tiresome(as well as the misogynistic urges which came out of it)	 and like punk	 I still am a fan of what is considered classic rock or glam rock	 and this film about Strange Fruit's long	 strange reunion is an affectionate tribute to those days.<br /><br />One of the reasons the film works is the care of the people behind the scenes. Brian Gibson directed WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT	 about Tina Turner(while I had problems with the dramatic parts of the film	 the music was handled very well)	 writers Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais co-wrote THE COMMITMENTS and were behind the music-oriented British TV show OVER THE RAINBOW	 and the songs Strange Fruit played were co-written by Foreigner's Mick Jones(not to be confused with The Clash's Mick Jones)	 so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about. Also	 two cast members are musicians in their own right(Bill Nye I don't know about	 though the film credits him with his own singing	 and he certainly looks like a lead singer of that era	 while Jimmy Nail was in another British TV show which was music-oriented	 though I forget the name	 and he was in EVITA)	 and the others are convincing at it. And while	 as I said	 a lot of 70's bands like Strange Fruit behaved badly towards women	 the movie doesn't make the same mistake(except for the woman who follows Timothy Spall around); as the manager of the reunion	 Juliet Aubrey is quite good and plays a fully rounded character.<br /><br />The other actors are all good as well	 with special praise to Stephen Rea	 who handles the more dramatic role well without sentimentality. There are a couple of plot points which don't work	 but overall this is quite enjoyable. Oh yeah	 and the music is good too."	1.0
"This has got to go down as almost one of the worst movies of all time. Awful acting	 awful script... and they were the good points! One to Definitely miss! The jokes	 if you could call them that	 were so predictable as to be pathetic. Pamela Anderson is still relying on her body to detract from the fact that her acting is just as plastic! I sat willing to give it a chance	 hoping that it was going to improve which	 alas	 it didn't! If it was a choice between this and a book	 I suggest you settle down for a good read! I like Denise Richards	 which is why I gave this movie a go	 but why she has let her self be cast in this movie is beyond me!"	0.0
"The quote I used for my summary occurs about halfway through THE GOOD EARTH	 as a captain of a Chinese revolutionary army (played by Philip Ahn) apologizes to a mob for not having time to shoot MORE of the looters among them	 as his unit has just been called back to the front lines. Of course	 the next looter about to be found out and shot is the main character of the film	 the former kitchen slave girl O-Lan (for whose portrayal Luise Rainer	 now 99-years-old	 won her second consecutive best actress Oscar).<br /><br />The next scene finds O-Lan dutifully delivering her bag of looted jewels to her under-appreciative husband	 farmer Wang Lung (Paul Muni)	 setting in motion that classic dichotomy of a man's upward financial mobility being the direct inverse of his moral decline.<br /><br />For a movie dealing with subject matter including slavery	 false accusations	 misogyny	 starvation	 home invasion	 eating family pets	 mental retardation	 infanticide	 exploited refugees	 riots	 civil war	 summary mass street executions	 bigamy	 child-beating	 adultery	 incest	 and insect plagues of biblical proportions	 THE GOOD EARTH is a surprisingly heart-warming movie.<br /><br />My parting thought is in the form of another classic quote	 from O-Lan herself (while putting the precious soup bone her son has just admitted stealing from an old woman back into the cooking pot after husband Wang Lung had angrily tossed it to the dirt floor on the other side of their hut): ""Meat is meat."""	1.0
"All Dogs Go to Heaven plays on the canine criminal underworld. The film is a delight for children with a comical and dark-but-satisfying and happy-ending storyline with plenty of song and dance. It features outcast Charlie	 a fellow canine criminal who is murdered but returns from the dead. He meets a homeless human girl who looks up to him	 and through this relationship	 he realizes the meaning of life and self-sacrifice. This is a cute animation loved very much through my eyes as a child. I would highly recommend this film to children. I'm unsure about how adults would react to it. (I tried to watch it a few years ago on VHS	 but those recordings don't last long	 do they?)"	1.0
"This movie was based on actual fact? I sincerely hope not!<br /><br />We get to see what appears to be numerous armed cops empty an equal amount of guns at 2 guys who only got armored torso's. That's a great idea; aim for the armor!...excuse me	 but how about those big fat unmissable heads or their legs for crying out loud. Or were there invisible tanks protecting them? were they from Crypton?Did i miss something here?<br /><br />This movie started out decent enough but after 20 minutes of shoot-out it really takes a turn to boringlane.<br /><br />And that documentary style didn't work for me either	 but thats just something one finds likable or not.<br /><br />Highly unbelievable stuff which makes it hard to see it through 'til the end.<br /><br />3/10 for the fine editing."	0.0
"I've read countless of posts about this game being so similar to Max Payne	 when i played it the first time i thought it was a bit weird arcade-like game with a desire to rip-off the Max Payne style (not just bullet-time). So when i played it for a couple of hours i realized how much fun it is! and how different from ""Max Payne""	 yeah the bullet time is a bit similar but i think it fits differently to the game-style. This game is non-stop action - a mix between a shoot'em up and a fight'em up	 so much fun	 as a big fan of Max Payne i must say that the storyline of DTR is not near to the greatness of Max Payne	 the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same	 but if you want a bit more of that ""bullet-time"" you should definitely own this game."	1.0
"In the last 10 years I have worked in 3 different indie professional wrestling organizations	 managed many pro wrestlers (including 2 Backyard Wrestling stars)	 worked on 2 different wrestling TV programs and did voice-overs and commentary for many wrestling DVD's. I have NEVER witnessed the level of outright amateurish stupidity	 lack of talent and skill	 and shoddy production quality found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. To even list this as a wrestling video of ANY kind is an outright misuse of the term. Shot with low-dollar video cameras	 it's essentially home videos of kids play-fighting in back yards. The sound quality is bad	 the video quality is bad	 and the acting is horrendous. The ""wrestlers"" wear makeshift costumes with hand-drawn tee shirts and ski masks and hit each other with a variety of items and halfway imitate wrestling moves. Sometimes the ""matches"" are on the grass. Sometimes on a back yard trampoline. ALL are poorly acted and executed with a shameless lack of any wrestling skill. In short	 don't bother with this stinker. Whether your interest in this DVD is entertainment or academic (both in my case)	 you will be terribly disappointed."	0.0
This movie kinda let me down. It seemed a lot like the movie Jaws when the Hopper was telling the Mayor to close parks was like when Roy Shider was telling the Mayor to close the beaches. They both said no way its summer! But the box says Hopper has to get into the mind of a killer and think like one. But he really doesn't do anything too interesting or exciting. I'm not even a little convinced he and his partner have any experience doing police work when they are in the office wondering how they are gonna solve this case. They just say lets do police work and we'll solve it. And whats up with all the old men with pool cues. I didn't even begin to believe that they were mob bosses. And then the guy who was doubting the guy the mob picked to handle finding the killer. With his hundred dollar haircut and that he thinks his Di@k is the size of a schoolbus. Come on what cruddy lines. I thought he was gonna hit him with a baseball bat like in the other movies. I got this movie used and wouldn't buy it new. I suggest you skip this movie. Oh and it was funny seeing the microphone above the scene where hopper is going out to get coffee.	0.0
"I first saw this film when I was flipping through the movie channels on my parents DirecTV. It was on the Sundance channel and was just starting. I love music	 especially late 60s and this is what the BJM sounded like (The Dandys are alright). Everything about the Brian Jonestown Massacre intrigued me from the music	 to Anton and Joel's personalities	 to the illicit drug use. It was funny because as I was watching the first party scene when everyone is doing lines my parents walked by and decided to watch (The look on their faces were priceless). Anyways this is definitely one of my favorite movies because it introduced me to The Brian Jonestown Massacre who is now my favorite band of all time.<br /><br />just watch it... seriously"	1.0
"When they killed off John Amos's character they killed the show. He was the vital part of the info structure. You had a story of an inner city family's struggling to make it the best way they knew how. They were poor	 they were black	 and they were living proof that if you have Jesus and your family that nothing is too hard. Sure James would lose jobs and JJ would fail in school but the family always managed to find a way. <br /><br />James was the strong male role model that earned the income and disciplined the children. Florida was the strong lady that would everyone including James when he needed a shoulder to cry on or hug to make it. The kids had personalities and input which made them important as a family unit. Their neighbor Willona was also a key element because she represented not only a friend but some dear enough to be family. Things were bright	 gritty	 funny	 and honest until they changed the course of the program. James dies and JJ took over the show. <br /><br />Flo was still mom	 Thelma was blossoming into a lady and Michael was still the militant midget but JJ was the show. We were expected to believe that the family with no father or prominent bread winner was going to be able to stay in the apartment. I guess James's paycheck didn't do much for the family. They were only threatened with eviction because they said they were moving and not because no one in the house was working. I know that JJ	 Flo	 Thelma and even Michael eventually got jobs but come on here be for real. James worked so much that you could feel for him but the others weren't realistic at all and that's a shame.<br /><br />JJ was the comic relief but I felt the show need substance. It's OK to be funny but they had a chance to show a real family and what it took to survive in the real world and they threw it all away on a few laughs. Michael's character almost disappeared while the rest of the cast slipped into the shadows of the JJ Evan's show. I mean really	 here was a guy that was failing in school	 he kept getting laid off	 and he painted for money in about two episodes. James had always been there to encourage his talent but Flo and the rest of the family didn't seem to care.<br /><br />Why did it take him so long to understand that painting was what he was meant to do? He could have sold painting's on the street or worked for people that print billboards and cards. (He did but something went wrong with that.) Why did he not make it and why did the others give up on their dreams? I'll tell you why	 it was because they didn't have a father in their life to care and to cheer them on and their mother stopped being their to support their dreams. The show stopped teaching us about growing	 building and learning and started teaching us about gimmicks and catch phrases. They should have kept James. If any show needed a father it was that one."	0.0
"""The Garden of Allah"" was one of the first feature length	 3-strip Technicolor films. To correct a previous poster the first Technicolor feature (after Disney's 5-year exclusivity deal) was 1935's ""Becky Sharp"" which was a costume drama that used the color for it's garish color costumes.<br /><br />""The Garden of Allah"" looks as if it could have been shot years later as the cinematography uses not only the color but also the use of shadows. It must have been amazing for an audiences at the time to see a color feature after seeing basically only black and white films for their whole life. Unfortunately	 the film does not stand up to the cinematography. That being said	 the film is worth seeing just as a visual treat."	1.0
"Sadly I don't remember the book anymore	 but I do recall that I was captivated by the stories of Edgar Wallace. This Film represents a typical German Production of low quality. It does not hold my attention - although the story itself is good	 it is just badly adabted. At the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their performances. Even the well known and liked German Actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Aren't cannot rescue this poor spectacle. However there's hope ... I've been told that the films following this one are getting better and better. So in conclusion I must say that this film doesn't deserve the cinematic screen but may be enough for a lazy afternoon."	0.0
"The industry dropped the ball on this. The trailer does not do the movie justice and when this opened it was on a hand full of screens. Had people had an opportunity to see this	 work of mouth would have made it very successful. The 2 lead actresses each give great emotional performances that really draw you in to the story and especially the characters. I checked this out based on the rave recommendation Richard Roeper or (Ebert and Roeper) in his book. An example of a great film that never got fully released except on a few screens. Which gave it no chance to be seen. Some movies go to video quickly because they aren't that good. This is Oscar worthy and it's a tragedy on many levels that most will never even hear of it. Maybe via word of mouth it will gain a following on DVD or cable. If you haven't see this movie you should. Great performances of the 2 lead actresses make this movie. It could have just been another formulaic teen movie after school special but instead it stands up well to other note worthy films. Girl Interrupted comes to mind. If you like that you will like this. <br /><br />Both girls are in one amazing emotional scene after another without coming off as melodramatic. Even though Alicia is angry and Deanna is crying through most of the movie it is done is such a real way that they do not come off as stereotypical characters or as melodramatic. The movie will move you in many scenes and if you are an aspiring actor use these real performances as your school. Erica is even better in this than in Traffic. I hope both of these actors get more roles that utilize their talents as well and let them shine. See this movie and if you like	 recommend to friends so it doesn't get lost among all the blockbuster crap that comes out every year. This movie was buried while Spiderman 2 tops records. What kind of word are we living in? AGHhh. So to make the world right again see this and recommend it."	1.0

"2005 gave us the very decent ""gore porn"" flick Hostel	 and 2006 gave us Live Feed; a not so decent rip-off of Hostel. Live Feed follows pretty much the same formula as Eli Roth's earlier film	 except this time the dumb kids are in Asia rather than central Europe. The plot focuses on these dumb kids	 and one of them has annoyed one of the locals so they find themselves in trouble. The locals decide to lock them all in a theatre	 and kill them. Despite the fact that I'd heard some less than favourable things about this film before seeing it	 I still hoped that it might be at least half decent because director Ryan Nicholson previously made the very decent 45 minute rape and revenge film 'Torched'	 but this film falls down simply because most of it is either ridiculous or boring. The film is obviously trying to hark back to the good old days of Grindhouse cinema (which Hostel did	 successfully)	 but it really doesn't come off. Surprisingly	 considering Nicholson's previous work in special effects - not even the gore is impressive...although it is a lot better than the acting! There's not much else I can say about this film...it's bad and not in a good way. Avoid it!"	0.0
"I found this film to be an interesting study in cause and effect but little more than that. The basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions (deliberate and otherwise) effect the lives of the others. The film's premise holds great promise but I feel it fails to deliver on its promise. Too much time is spent telling the audience about chaos theory and too little time actually showing it. As a result	 I never got a true feel for any of the characters and never made a good connection with them emotionally. By the end of the movie	 I had a ""so what"" attitude about all of them. A stronger direction in character development would have made this movie great	 but as it stands it is merely so-so"	0.0
"I was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press it received	 but after viewing it I was terribly disappointed. Slums is a totally unfunny film mixed with a Todd Solondz type of disturbing family reality sans Todd's brand of humor. The story drags along and each scene is worse than the last. Maybe I missed the point	 but if this film is an example of every girl's growing up experience I am glad to be a man."	0.0
"The feel of this movie was amazing. Adam Sandler's performance was very inspiring. As he played a very rattled and fragile character	 he took his ability to the very edge and really worked the role. His character was really interesting. I can see myself reading the script for this movie and not being half as interested in the part as Sandler made me. For someone who plays primarily comedy roles	 he pulled off a serious role with what seemed to be his own quirks and input. I especially loved the scene in which Adam and Don's characters rode the motorized scooter around the city. I familiarized with the moment	 because it seemed like Don was witnessing one thing Adam does to get away from it all. With his video games	 music	 and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past	 riding his scooter with his headphones on seemed like an escape from his thoughts. This movie is definitely worth the watch."	1.0
"Life's going not to badly for Harry Mitchell	 he's an ex-air force major (plus nifty little pension I imagine)	 who's raking in the cash for a patent he's developed (fusing titanium and steel via explosive process	 creating super metal fit for NASA)	 and his wife of twenty-odd years has kept herself in pretty good nick. He's got a nice little pad in LA. I like to see visions of the 80s consumer dream	 and you get a good slice here	 what with the restored silver Jag (a series 1 E-type roadster) for him	 and the gorgeous antique dolls house for her (as well as I'm sure other trinkets and boys toys). There's always got to be more though hasn't there? So Harry let's himself get caught up in some romantic shenanigans (you're only as old as the woman you're feeling). As in many films noir	 one mistake	 in an otherwise blotch-less life	 leads to a downwards arc for Harry.<br /><br />Three blackmailers leech onto him. These are where the value are for me	 great character actors playing very believable roles. Bobby Shy (played by Clarence Williams III) is a black ex-con who is capable of performing incredible psychopathic acts in order to avoid jail and punish double-crossers. He's reminiscent of Pluto	 the vicious black ex-con psychopath from Carl Franklin's well-regarded neo-noir ""One False Move"" (1992). There's a similar character motivation I believe. Both men have had enough of the man	 and well pretty much everyone	 in extremis. Robert Trebor plays Leo Franks	 a fat lily-livered pansy who runs a nudie parlour where gents can photograph nude models at $25 for half an hour	 and $50 for a whole hour (did anyone else guffaw at the lack of discount?). He's in over his head	 and it's great to watch Trebor acting when Leo starts to feel the heat	 believable breakdown. John Glover wins as Alan Raimy	 who is the brains of the plot	 an actually brilliant man who becomes a pornographer and turns to a life of crime out of sheer sociopathic ennui. He's a sexual sadist and does a few particularly unpleasant things during the movie	 including what I believe is a pretty well-implied rape (pay attention to his RAP sheet readout	 it's easily missed	 and read between the lines for the motel scene with ""Slim"").<br /><br />In common with One False Move	 though not exclusively	 I think the real impact of the movie is in the unusually communicative scenes of violence.<br /><br />So far so good but I think there's a real problem with the film. Harry Mitchell is told at one point that he has his ""tit in the wringer"". My problem is that Harry Mitchell is played by Roy Scheider. Roy Scheider protagonists never lose	 they're self-sure and smooth	 but not in an annoying way. I feel I'm being asked to believe that his character is in peril	 the movie relies on this for dramatic tension; however I didn't believe it. For me it's like being asked to believe that Sandra Bullock's character is going to end up sleeping alone by the end of a romantic drama	 or Stephen Seagal's character is going to get taken down by the baddies (did actually happen in one movie but was done deliberately for shock value). Roy Scheider doesn't convince as an adulterer either	 you don't feel any annoyance with him at all	 his character is Teflon-coated.<br /><br />It also felt like a movie that took some cuts. At 110 minutes it still feels underdeveloped: Harry's wife	 Ann Margaret	 is pretty much a cardboard cutout	 an extension of Harry	 her back story as a politician running for office receives scant attention. The effect that the affair has on Harry's marriage isn't properly communicated. This could be a Frankenheimer problem	 he's not known for character development. I never felt that Harry was dealing with little more than an overtly annoying and erroneous tax claim from the IRS. <br /><br />There is good sleazy violent noir content in this film	 but I feel that to be in the excellent bracket that the casting of Harry could have been done better (no disrespect to the great Roy Scheider). The film felt short	 even with the long running time	 and I think could have taken some more fleshing out.<br /><br />But you really can't forget the sleaze	 like the deliciously pervy scene of Harry taking photos of Doreen in the nudie parlour."	1.0
"Abysmal with a capital ""A"". This has got to be one of	 if not THE	 unfunniest show on TV right now. I'm about as anti-bush as it gets	 but this show doesn't even get a chuckle out of me. What you think of Bush as a president has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether or not you'll like this piece of crap show. The ""jokes"" are not funny at all. For example	 in a scene when lil bush has his underwear on his head: ""Welcome to camp al-qa-eeda!"". There is NOTHING funny about that. Is it even supposed to be joke? The commercials that were shown in the weeks leading up to the show	 hyping it up	 were funnier than the show itself	 and that's just sad. Hopefully this does not even get considered for a second season. It shouldn't even have had a first."	0.0
"Definitely at the top five of best John Garfield movies has to be Pride of the Marines. It's the true story of Marine private Al Schmid who at the cost of his own sight	 while wounded held off a horde of storming Japanese on Guadalcanal. <br /><br />The story nicely segments in three parts	 Al Schmid's home life where he's a simple working stiff who's just getting serious with a woman and who likes nothing better than his bowling night. Pearl Harbor is bombed and he's off to war as millions of others were.<br /><br />The second part is at Guadalcanal and we see part of the action where he's in an isolated machine gun nest	 holding off Japanese troops. His action prevented Marine positions from being overrun	 but a grenade does in his eyesight.<br /><br />And of course the third part is his painful adjustment to civilian life and to reassure himself that people aren't just caring for him out of pity	 most of all that girl he was seeing Eleanor Parker.<br /><br />This film was broadcast on TCM on John Garfield's 95th birthday and there was a documentary on Garfield hosted by his daughter. One of the people interviewed said that Garfield was the actor most believable in working class roles in having and holding a union card. <br /><br />In that respect he was lucky in that he did land with Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Though he kept getting typecast in gangster roles in the tradition of that studio	 Garfield was terrific in these parts because of his background	 because he came from the kind of life Al Schmid had	 with the exception of Garfield's Jewish background.<br /><br />In that respect he was perfect to play the part of a working class hero like Al Schmid who accepted the responsibility of defending his country. No super heroics here	 just a guy who'd rather have been back in Philadelphia	 but doing a job that had to be done.<br /><br />It's a great part for Garfield. It's a film one shouldn't miss. I do wonder though whatever happened to the real Al Schmid."	1.0

"This movie is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school	 watching as the RAWANDAN genocide un-furls around him.<br /><br />The movie starts off with a brief explanation about the past history and rivalry of Rawanda. Then it jumps to the story as told through the eyes of a young idealistic ""NEW-COMER"" a young teacher who doesn't take life or the situation too seriously. As he and the driver approach a road-block he plays around with his drivers I.D. not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver can't identify himself as being of the right tribe to the soldiers they'll be killed. And thats how he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfolding around him. Suddenly realizes that every Rawandan (including his driver) is involved and that the Europeans soldiers and tourists cannot and will not help. The media cameras cannot stop machete's	 and there's too many machete wielding militia-men too shoot. the title comes from the armies captain saying he's going to shoot the dogs eating the dead-bodies around his compound	 but won't shoot the Militia-men that are killing people around the compound. Mainly because they haven't fired at the soldiers yet. Finally he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims	 flees with his tail in-between his legs	 rather than face immanent death with the school kids he's promised not to leave behind.<br /><br />It's more of character study	 and a come to Jesus moment for one character	 than a story about the genocide in ""RAWANDA"". This movie didn't have to take place in RAWANDA	 it could have taken place any one of the Genocidal hell holes going around this world at any given time."	0.0
"First of all I would like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the Dutch folklore story of the ghost ship that is also called THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. In this film	 you will not see a single sailing boat. You will not see sailors	 ghosts	 or anything remotely exciting. It is not the story of the ghost ship	 and I wish they had notified it in the main credits or I wouldn't have watched it	 because I really thought it was the film about the legend. It seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship	 since the film is listed on the Wikipedia page for the ""Flying Dutchman"" legend... I don't understand why. It is maybe based on the resembling legend called ""The Wandering Jew""? Or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend? The film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes. Unfortunately	 it is the only battle scene of the film. Then you see Daniel Emilfork (who was Krank in City of Lost Children) for about two seconds	 and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting. Unfortunately he is very bad in the film. The same thing can be said about Italian actor Nino Manfredi	 who was one of Italia's best actors ever	 and who here is condemned to embody a crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the ""wise man"" of the film. And boy	 does that film need wiseness! Every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in excrement	 yelling	 torturing others (in excrement)	 fornicating (in excrement) or laying in excrement some more just for the fun of it. It seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in feces at a point or another. Coming from a Dutch director	 you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece	 elements which contributed to make Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven's film	 ""Flesh + Blood""	 such a great film. The thought of ""Flesh + Blood"" would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight-forward would be good. Unfortunately	 and unlike ""Flesh + Blood""	 there is no dramatic progression	 no fights	 no good acting	 and put simply	 no ""Flesh and Blood"". The photography	 as the opening sequence unfolds	 is well-done and enticing. This too	 stops very early in the film. The music	 from Nicola Piovani (of ""La vità e bella"" fame) is repetitive and annoying	 when not irrelevant (it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence	 while on screen the actors are splashing in liquid dung). Throughout the first ""act"" of the film	 which lasts nothing less than an hour (!)	 the film takes place within the same perimeter	 which is around the farm where the main characters live. The characters play with excrement a lot	 drown in it	 play in it. A long period of time elapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character	 a young boy who loves to play in excrement	 to become older and play in excrement some more. The bird-man talks a lot to say foolish things in Italian. Spanish conquistadors speak French. Nothing makes sense. Everything is confused and takes hours to happen. Then there is a second act called ""the Ship""	 in which we see what might have been a ship	 a long time ago	 but which is now remains of a ship (covered with excrement did I mention?). The main character	 while walking a bit further away from the farm	 just happens to run into it	 and decides it's really cool so let's live in it. The hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him	 but he doesn't really mind because (did I mention?) he's not very bright. He thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it	 until more conquistadors show up (at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the Don Quixote style hats but as I've said it's really confused who's who)	 make the Dutchman a prisoner	 along with the retarded hunchback	 and they burn the ship to the ground. The last part of the film	 which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middle-age peasants fighting in it	 takes place in a mad asylum. Yet more torture and drowning each other with feces. Yet more loitering for the director	 who seems to have definitely given up on his job	 or passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job. In the end	 a lot of the mentally-challenged new ""friends"" that the Dutchman made die. The woman he had sex with who was his brother's wife to begin with tries to have him meet his son. The Dutchman and his son talk. The film ends after two hours of dungy images and calamitous acting and technical performances. Then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends	 while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they don't have enough financing powers to put battles instead or even horses."	0.0
"This has to be one of the top overrated anime shows ever made. And yes	 I was even shown the ""End of Evangelion"" and that still made me hate it even more. Not to mention the countless rip-offs of this show!<br /><br />I don't mind psychological and philosophy untertones	 but Evangelion drags it out into the mud like nothing else! Not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting. The only ones that seemed to be interesting were Asuka	 Misato and Pen-Pen. Other than that	 mostly everyone else were a bunch of whiny crybaby losers. They need to go to a psyciatric center	 not piloting giant robots against aliens called ""Angels"".<br /><br />Even the mecha and alien fights did not help at all. Goes something like this:<br /><br />""Well	 there are these robots	 and they are really cool because they bleed(!) when they get hurt	 but they are not really mecha	 but captured angels	 so sometimes they go insane and don't do what the underaged pilots want	 and they have to be controlled better...blah blah blah!""<br /><br />I am so sorry	 but I just cannot recommend Evangelion to anyone	 anime otakus or not. To those who love this series greatly	 fine you're entitled to that opinion	 I respect you. But to thoses that have a ""out of your mind"" obsession to think that every one will like this series	 you are more of an egotist.<br /><br />I prefer ""Macross""	 ""Mospeada""	 ""Run-Dim"" and ""Robot Taekwon V"" myself."	0.0

"Start with the script. I have seen cartoons with more depth than ""Envy"". Anytime characters keep repeating what you have already seen	 and was not funny the first time	 a movie is in deep trouble	 which ""Envy"" certainly is. A movie that relies on one joke had better have somewhere to go with it. Here we have a film that goes absolutely nowhere. Christopher Walken especially would like to forget this bomb	 because his character is so weak. Ben Stiller has been in some pretty good black comedies	 ""Flirting With Disaster""	 and ""Duplex""	 immediately come to mind. Be certain that ""Envy"" is not a black comedy. There are no double meanings	 just total nonsense. ""Envy"" deserves it's low rating	 because like it's subject matter	 it stinks. - MERK"	0.0
"Yet again one of the most misunderstood Goddesses of my country has been twisted by ""Westerners"" who cannot understand the esoteric symbolism of the Mother Goddess in her dark forms. The Mother takes on the frightening form of Kali Mata to destroy our inner demons	 and to terrify our egos. And though blood sacrifice is given to Kali and Durga	 the events depicted in this film are just absurd. The Mother takes on a wrathful form to be wrathful to our inner demons	 limitations	 and ego when no other form will suffice. It's also in her wrathful form that she burns away all your Karmas in the ""Smashan"" fires that you cultivate in your heart for her to dance on if you love her	 and she will bring you to reality and truth. Reality and truth has a dark side as well as light	 which serves a purpose. The Mother is the embodiment of the physical Universe as well	 she is Nature. Nature can be cruel and destructive to maintain balance. You cannot have growth and life without death and destruction. Kali represents the force of destruction for the purpose of new growth and life both mundane and spiritual in the universe. It's very outrageous to me that people who know nothing of India or it's divinity can just take one of our beloved Goddesses and use her like a cheap prostitute to make some low-budget	 talentless horror film. How dare they take our beloved Mother and portray her as a horror that makes people chop their eyelids off!? She is only horrific to those who are attached to their ego and who live in delusion 	 greed	 anger	 and other inner-demons. It's very clear to me that the person who wrote this movie must have a very serious self-deluding ego	 and serious inner-demons to see Kali as so horrible and terrible. When the ego drops away she becomes a form that is enchanting	 beautiful	 and young	 a beauty that is so enchanting to behold that she enchants the entire Universe with it. Kali Maa is an ancient Mother	 not to be trifled with for the sake of entertainment	 let's just hope that in her endless compassion and mercy that she does not take on wrathful form to those involved with this movie.<br /><br />The audacity that Westerners have in using religions like my own	 or the religions of the Caribbean Islands such as Santeria	 and Vodou which are actually very positive	 and other such religions to twist and exaggerate misunderstood elements that the Western mind cannot comprehend	 is totally ridiculous. It's clear that there is no respect for what people live	 breathe and believe in when it comes to these kind of flicks.<br /><br />Kali Maa in reality is a caring and compassionate mother	 whom we shed tears at her beautiful feet in devotion and love for. And I am happy that my Mother takes on wrathful form sometimes to protect her devotees from themselves and from outside forces.<br /><br />Many Praises to the REAL Kali Maa	 who has shown MANY the path of God and realization."	0.0
"I look at this page	 and it seems disapproving to me to have to listen to someone ramble and rant at a real classic. Sure	 I agree to let everyone have their opinion	 but here's mine:<br /><br />This movie should not be missed by any classic horror watcher	 and should be seen many casual viewers around the world. Sure	 it has lost some of it's flair and greatness with age	 especially in todays world of CGI effects	 but that's not why you should like it.<br /><br />You should like it because it actually is a scary movie	 even for today's standards. It's overall ickyness will creep you out just as much as the original audiences	 so don't slam a classic if you haven't given it a chance. Watch it	 but not with a critical attitude. Watch it to have fun	 how it was originally intended."	1.0
"I just saw this movie at a sneak preview and all I can say is...""What did I just watch????"" And I mean that in a good and bad way.<br /><br />The plot is really simple. Stiller and Black play friends/neighbors. Stiller is the focused	 hardworker while Black is a dreamer. Black invents this idea to create a spray that erases poo. The idea becomes very popular	 and Black becomes very rich. The extravagant lifestyle that Black gains and the fact that he still tries to be best friends with Stiller causes Stiller to become crazy with envy.<br /><br />As I said	 the plot is simple. Everything else is plain odd. The direction is odd	 with a weird rotating opening shot to out-of-nowhere sped up sequences. The dialouge and the acting is very odd; odd in a rambling sort of way. And the sound track is the oddest thing in the movie	 from the weird ""Envy"" song that keeps on reappearing to the scene where you think you're going to hear a classic 80's song but suddenly it's in Japanese.<br /><br />So	 the true question is this...is odd funny? That depends purely on the individual. I was cracking up at the shear unwavering weirdness of the movie. After the screening I heard people call it horribly unfunny and glad that it was free. Strangely	 I understood their point. There are no jokes whatsoever	 so if you aren't hooked by the uniqueness of it all	 you will hate this movie. Absolutely hate it.<br /><br />This movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a DVD cult classic. If you can laugh at a movie with no real jokes	 like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love	 then I suggest you see it. If you don't	 run away from this movie. It'll only make you mad."	1.0
"WARNING! Don't even consider watching this film in any form. It's not even worth downloading from the internet. Every bit of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid.

The group rents a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun vacation. Then	 the deaths begin.

"This film (along with Rinne) are minor gems amongst the retread homage pics that have passed for horror movies so far at the 8FTDF ""HorrorFest."" And	 yes	 that's faint praise indeed. 'Cause there's not much worse in filmdom than would-be auteurs who think atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot.<br /><br />And that's all you get with The Abandoned. This is a film that was made almost entirely in the directors head. Sure	 it would have been nice if he'd transfered it to film	 but this happened instead. It's a very pretty film with a few genuine scares	 but the last reel is strictly for the latte slurping cineaste crowd."	0.0
"The film was made in 1942 and with World War 11 around	 the movie industry decided to capitalize on the fact that spies were around.<br /><br />The film is fun to watch due to the fabulous dancing of Eleanor Powell. The late Miss Powell was certainly a great hoofer in every sense of the word. She is again paired with a very young looking Red Skelton here. The two of them also starred in ""I Dood It.""<br /><br />Moroni Olsen	 who 3 years later	 was superb as the interrogating police officer in ""Mildred Pierce"" again appears as an officer asking Powell to deliver an item. Trouble is that Olsen and his rogues are really the Japanese spies.<br /><br />Bert Lahr is his usual brilliant self here and he gets ample support from Virginia O'Brien."	0.0
"Few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as Fire has. The movie is pretentious garbage. It does not achieve anything at an artistic level. The only thing it managed to receive is a ban in India. If only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy	 the ban would have been more justifiable.<br /><br />Now that I've got my distress out of my system	 I am more able to analyse the movie: <br /><br />* From the onset the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start conversing in English. The director	 of course	 did not make the movie for an Indian audience; however it underestimated its international audiences by over simplifying it. Watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect English is too unreal to be true.<br /><br />* Next we get regular glimpses into Radha's dreams. These scenes are not very effective. They coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie. I'm still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story. I felt that the surrealism was lost.<br /><br />* The love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement. In any case	 they do not achieve either of the two.<br /><br />* The names chosen for the women	 Radha and Sita	 are names of Hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences. However	 since the film wasn't meant for Indian audiences in the first place	 the shock-through-name-selection is not meant to achieve its goal	 which is absurd.<br /><br />* The quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled. A better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject.<br /><br />* The acting felt wooden although Nandita Das brought some life into the role	 the others were wasted. I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film. The male leads were outright rubbish.<br /><br />In case you are a fan of Earth and wish to see more of the director	 stay away from this one. Please."	0.0
"This was one of the worst movies EVER!!!!!!!! It was so bad	 I was laughing through the WHOLE movie! The plot was SO cheesy; especially the end. This movie turns from an end-of-the-world-disaster to save-the-eels! I mean	 c'mon! And I swear...I think they use SOCK PUPPETS for the eels! And there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who happened to be divorced. How predictable! It was SO terrible that my mom	 my sister	 and I couldn't finish it	 and when we DID finish it	 it was about a year later! The second time we watched it and we finished it this time	 we did MST3K-like comments throughout the movie.<br /><br />Summary: Only watch this if you're a movie basher! Make hilarious comments	 watch this at a sleepover for laughs	 and I mean HUGE laughs. Also watch for mockery. The metaphor that explains this movie: This movie is a very shallow field full of cheese and sock puppets!"	0.0
"Oh my God what the hell happened here?!! I'm not going to say this again but what sort of backward movie is this? The dubbing in this is way worst than the dubbing in ""King Kong vs Godzilla""	Linda Miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesy.Its about some villain called Dr.Who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as King Kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap Kong.When he does(thats when Linda Miller gets annoying)he makes Kong his slave but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes.Then Dr.Who sends the robot after him.<br /><br />Later when I was watching the movie I got a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns started moaning.As I sat through the misery of watching the DVD while it was playing I was hoping that the madness in the movie was going to end until the fight.The ending has to be a really bad one because they could've shown Kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs again.<br /><br />Don't watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do... beware of the disappointment you will receive."	0.0
"This film is a portrait of the half-spastic teenage boy Benjamin who has to visit a boarding school because of his lousy marks in Math. He didn't make the best experiences in life before and got serious self-esteem issues. After a rough start at his new school	 he starts making friends	 falls in love with a girl and does some American Pieish teenage stuff.<br /><br />Beside some comedy elements	 the film is told in a very serious way	 focussing on Benjamin and his problems.<br /><br />If you already don't like this story outline	 save your time and watch something else. If you do	 please be aware of the following:<br /><br />1) Benjamin is a total loser. Whatever he does	 he does it terribly wrong and then he goes for self-pity all the time. For me he wasn't that kind of ""charming loser"" who you can feel sympathy for and laugh with. Instead he and his behavior really annoyed me and with my own teenage years not so far behind I could barely stand watching.<br /><br />2) The film hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be but from my experience the characters just aren't (except for Janosch maybe). And yes	 I know this film is based on an auto-biography written by a 17-year old - but having some experiences with German schools and German youth myself	 I don't believe him.<br /><br />3) Showing the sexual awakening really is an important thing for a film with this subject. But I doubt that teenage boys do an ""Ejaculate on the cookie""-contest where everyone has to hit a cookie with his sperm during mass-masturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the sperm-wet cookie afterwards. Although it kinda amused me in a contemptible way	 it's nor funny neither underlining the serious attempts of this film.<br /><br />4) There's a sub-plot about Benjamin's family and his father betraying his wife - still	 I don't know why it's there and where to put it. It just bored me.<br /><br />Well	 I personally hated this film for having the character of Benjamin	 being without a message	 concept	 scheme	 whatever and it's failing attempts to be dramatic and serious. However	 I can image that some people may find it sensible and touching. If you liked ""The Other Sister"" you'll probably like this one	 too. I hated both.<br /><br />17-year old boys shouldn't write an autobiography and if they do	 it doesn't seem to be the best idea to make a film out of it.<br /><br />2 out of 10."	0.0
"Since starting to read the book this movie is based on	 I'm having mixed feelings about the filmed result. I learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before I read the book	 because I found that if I read the book first I was inevitably disappointed in the film. This would undoubtedly have been true here	 whereas in the case of Atonement	 which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book I've ever seen	 it would probably not have mattered.<br /><br />I'm trying to figure out what the cause is	 and I suspect that I have to point my finger squarely at Michael Cunningham. Much as I respect him for The Hours (which I have not read but which I saw and was awed by) I cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted Susan Minton's book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it.<br /><br />It's not that I dislike the movie. I actually love the movie	 which is why	 since I started reading the novel	 I'm feeling disturbed about the whole thing. I feel disloyal to Ms. Minton for enjoying the movie which was so thooughly a departure from her work. Reading it	 I can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it. Unlike what one reviewer of the movie said	 it's not so much that some novels don't deserve to be a movie; it's more like some books just can't make the transition. Ms. Minton's novel operates on a level so personal and intimate to her central character	 so internally	 that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm. Even though a lot of the book is memory of real events	 it is memory	 and so fragmented and ethereal as to be	 I feel	 not filmable. I think that Ms. Minton's work is a real work of literature	 but cannot make the transition to film	 which in no way detracts from its value.<br /><br />I cannot yet report that Evening	 the film	 does not represent Evening	 the novel	 in any more than the most superficial way	 since I'm only halfway through	 but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point. I guess I'm writing this because I feel that if you're going to adapt a novel	 adapt it	 but don't make it something else that it's not. I'm not sure if Michael Cunningham has done anything wholly original	 but from what I can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else's work. We would not have The Hours if Virginia Woolf had not written Mrs. Dalloway	 and we would not have Evening	 in its distressed form	 if Susan Minton had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place. But it's too much to say that it would be better if Ms. Minton had left well enough alone	 because Evening	 the film	 is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own.<br /><br />Thus my confusion	 mixed feelings	 sense of disloyalty	 and ultimate conclusion that	 in this case	 the novel cannot be the film and vice versa	 and my eventual gratitude to both writers for doing what they did	 so that we have both works as they are."	1.0
"I remember watching the Disney version and watching it now makes me think it has somehow lost its magic touch. Plenty of other renditions	 Ever After put aside	 of Cinderella	 have	 in fact	 lost their touch throughout the years. Then I found this production with a flawless performance by Kathleen Turner as the evil stepmother and was blown away by the phantasmagorical essence of this fantasy story that has cast me under its spell since childhood.<br /><br />We all know the story of Cinderella	 a young girl who's father died and was dominated by her wicked stepmother and stepdaughters and longs to go to the ball for one last chance for freedom. But this plot line takes a different twist in the classic Fairy Tale by causing Cinderella (whose real name is Zizola	 and is only called Cinderella by her family because of her slavery) to be trapped in a situation of her father (who still lives) slowly losing himself to a dominant wife who manipulates him into playing favorites with his wife and step-daughters against his own and tries to poison him. Thus	 Zizola goes out to save her father by stopping her stepmother from finding another suitor at the ball by distracting the men who come her way. There	 the bored Prince Valiant has a change of heart from his dull life and falls in love with the mysterious lady in the strange dress (forged by a water nymph named Mab) with rose petals for slippers. <br /><br />What drew me to this film most of all was it's original take on the old Fairy Tale that none can compare to. It does not weave a web of lies like most Cinderella stories	 it does not ignore any reason as to why Cinderella would want to attend the ball and nor does it show a shallow side to the Prince as the Disney version did. Instead it shows more of Cinderella's selfless heart more than any other production and the artwork is simply stunning! The costumes are all beautifully made	 especially Zizola's sapphire blue ballgown to match the Marcella Plunkett's fantastical beauty and soft	 spirit-like voice. <br /><br />I would highly suggest this film for anyone who is interested in a dream-like sequence of the classic Fairy Tale with an interesting twist. My only problem is that the producers and director did not make a full collection of other Fairy Tales with this same element and the fact that the film is now out of print."	1.0
"What another reviewer called lack of character development	 I call understatement. The movie didn't bash one over the head with overexplanation or unnecessary backstory. Yes	 there were many untold stories that we only got a glimpse of	 but this was primarily a one-day snapshot into an event that catalyzed change in all of the characters' lives. Henry Thomas's performance was a really lovely study in the power of acting that focuses on reaction rather than action. Good rental."	1.0
"But the rest of us	 who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to get you crying..enjoy! <br /><br />Tom Hulce is magnificent as Dominick	 a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother	 Eugene	 played by Ray Liotta	 who is a doctor and who works very long hours. <br /><br />Due to Eugene's work schedule	 Dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make questionable judgment calls. He really just wants to be a good boy	 to do the right thing	 and to make his brother proud of him. He stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you crying before the damn movie even gets really started. <br /><br />Not about to give anything away here	 but the movie is extremely involving and sad and heartbreaking. Those unafraid of these things will have a field day with this beautiful story	 its loving characters and a great song I cannot quote here	 that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely appropriate..but you hear it in a bar.<br /><br />I thought Tom Hulce would be nominated for this movie	 since he was for 'Amadeus' I figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning. No such luck. Liotta is just as good but has less of an emotional impact	 but then he does later on. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she doesn't have much of a part here but it was nice of her to lend her name to a small drama set in Pittsburgh about two brothers who you will never forget."	1.0
"... but the trouble of this production is that it's very far from a good musical.<br /><br />Granted	 one can't always expect the witty masters like Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter; yet the music of this piece makes even Andrew Lloyd Webber look witty. It's deadly dull and uninventive (with one or two exceptions) and just after I watched it I couldn't recall a single significant melody - which is rather tragic coming from someone who learned the whole Another Hundred People from three listenings.<br /><br />It is also strangely un-theatrical. It takes place on an incredibly large stage (one really has to feel sorry for those people in front rows who broke their necks in order to see something happening 50 meters on the right or 100 meters on the left) and does absolutely nothing with it. When there's supposed to be one person singing on-stage	 that's just what you get - and the rest of the enormeous stage is empty. For me as an aspiring theatre director it was almost painful to watch.<br /><br />The fact remains	 Cole Porter seems to have captured the French culture in his works better than these no-talents can ever come close to. And I'm puzzled by the popularity of this would-be-legendary musical."	0.0

"Not even Goebbels could have pulled off a propaganda stunt like what Gore has done with this complete piece of fiction. This is a study in how numbers and statistics can be spun to say whatever you have predetermined them to say. The ""scientists"" Gore says have signed onto the validity of global warming include social workers	 psychologists and psychiatrists. Would you say a meteorologist is an expert in neuro-surgery? The field research and data analysis geologists are involved in do not support Gores alarmist claims of global warming. As one of those geologists working in the field for the last 40 years I have not seen any evidence to support global warming. My analysis of this movie and Gores actions over the last couple years brings me to the conclusion that global warming is his way of staying important and relevant. No more	 no less.

"The performance by Om Puri	 Smita Patil	 and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely	 along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by Govind Nihlani. The dialogues by Vijay Tendulkar is also great. <br /><br />I have not seen another movie like this. It is one whole	 each piece so nicely fit in the plot. You cannot not be impressed by this movie. <br /><br />Amrish Puri comes off as the bossy husband and 'baap' of Om Puri. Om Puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system. Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain. The first meeting of Anand Velankar with Rama Shetty's at Sadhashiv's place is absoulely stunning. Smita Patil does not play a main role	 but her part is also not distracting from the main plot. <br /><br />And to add to this all Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings. Saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble. He is also the 'guru' of Om Puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble.<br /><br />The movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody. Om Puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in Ardh Satya. <br /><br />A treat to all avid fans of Indian cinema."	1.0
"This amazing Oscar winner (4 in total) and John Ford's first Academy Award winner	 is simply spellbinding with a pounding score by Max Steiner. Called an Art film	 because Ford had very little money to make this great story about guilt and retribution	 and greed and stupidity. But what makes this movie such a classic	 is the direction and astounding photography and use of fog and lighting	 that was so different from the usual American film	 and more in the tradition of German expressionism. And the Oscar winning performance by Victor McLaglen as the drunken Gypo is simply unbelievable. Basically the movie takes place in Ireland	 and Gypo turns in a friend in the rebel movement to the English to collect 20 pounds to give to his girlfriend. But having all that money	 he starts blowing it on an all night drunk and giving it away	 while the leaders of the movement are trying to track down the informer. The whole movie is one night in a dark and foggy Ireland	 and a cast of characters that are memorable but all along	 the whole world of Gypo is closing in on him	 both psychologically. If I had to pick maybe three directors to have ALL their movies on a deserted island forever	 and nobody elses	 John Ford would certainly be one of them. What a truly remarkable movie..."	1.0
"Okay	 so I'm not a big video game buff	 but was the game House of the Dead really famous enough to make a movie from? Sure	 they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie	 as though justifying any particular scene of violence	 but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same	 with the hand in the bottom on the screen	 supposedly your own	 holding whatever weapon and goo-ing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be.<br /><br />It's an interesting premise in House of the Dead	 with a lot of college kids (LOADED college kids	 as it were	 kids who are able to pay some fisherman something like $1	500 just for a ride after they miss their boat) trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year. The first thing that comes to mind about House of the Dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations. At least in this case	 the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed. They look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter-tops	 but at least they THOUGHT they were dressed for the occasion.<br /><br />Clint Howard	 tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far	 delivers an absolutely awful performance	 the greatness of which overshadows every other actor in the movie. I can't stand it when well-known actors change their accents in movies	 it is so rarely effective	 and Howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an well-known actor pretend that he's this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air. He didn't even rasp well. It sounded like he was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something. Real tough there	 Clint! I expected more from him	 but then again	 he did agree to a part in this mess.<br /><br />Once we get to the island	 the movie temporarily turns into any one of the Friday the 13th movies that took place at Camp Crystal Lake. Lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed. The nudity was impressive	 I guess	 but let's consider something for a minute. These kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the Rave Of The Year	 find NO ONE	 and say	 well	 who wants a beer! Even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his wallet to get them all over there didn't think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight. Here you have the input from director Uwe Boll - There's alcohol! They won't notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves!<br /><br />So not only do they start drinking	 not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island	 but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is (dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along)	 the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they're alone. It's like they expected to find the island empty	 and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while	 they would have some privacy since there's no one else around. Brilliant!<br /><br />Now for the things that everyone hated	 judging by the reviews that I've read about the movie. Yes	 intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie	 mostly in order to show that	 yes	 the movie was being faithful to/directly copying the video game. Sure	 it was a stupid idea. I can't imagine who thought up that little nugget	 but worse than that is the Matrix-style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over. After the first time (at which point I found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original) it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film.<br /><br />One of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans	 who are much faster but getting tired	 running out of places to run	 and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with. The first two are done right in the movie	 the kids are terrified and don't have a lot of places to run since they're on an island	 but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler	 they find themselves heavily armed. And I mean that very strongly. I mean	 these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades	 which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead.<br /><br />Then you have what I call the techno-slasher scene. Since the rave never happened	 and I guess since Uwe Boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie	 there's one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead	 and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video. There's techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it's nothing but a blur of gory shot	 mostly only about 5 frames long (which is about 1/6 of a second) flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music. Clever	 I guess	 but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness or tension of even the gross-out effect because you can't see any one thing for long enough to react to it. You're just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of people compare this movie to Resident Evil	 mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it	 and they're exactly right. I appreciate that at least here	 as was not the case in Resident Evil	 it wasn't some man-made virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to infect other people	 changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires. 28 Days Later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie	 it's just too bad that House of the Dead didn't do a single original thing	 except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based	 just in case you forget. I really think that this should have been a much better movie. While obviously I can't say that I know much about the game it's based on	 just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie	 but unfortunately I think that's more often the case than not with horror movies. It's really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no-holds-barred horror film	 and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot	 which suggests the possibility of a sequel."	0.0
"This Hong Kong filmed potboiler packs in more melodrama than week's worth of 'The Young & The Restless'. This one is more of a throwback to the original 'Emmanuelle' trilogy(especially 'Goodbye Emmanuelle') than a D'Amato sleazefest. Chai Lee(Emy Wong)undergoes a stunning transformation from dour nurse to hot-to-trot streetwalker. Future Italian porn star/politician	 Illona Staller	 who would later go by the name Ciccolina(and have sex with an HIV positive John Holmes) plays Emy's competition. Exotic locales and some decent soft-core scenes round this one out. Recommended for fans of the original 'Emmanuelle'	 of which I am one!"	1.0
"I'm sick of people whining about Ewoks! True	 they're not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars	 but they DID happen	 so deal with it! Besides	 they ARE cute	 and I don't care if they're marketable. Yubb Nubb!<br /><br />This movie always leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The end could not be better. I'm excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from Luke to Anakin. I love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way. So those of you who are complaining that Vader's helmet was removed	 take a moment to think about it. It's very effective. Vader	 the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years	 is finally revealed as a sick-looking man. He is not entirely machine - he's vulnerable.<br /><br />I don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in A New Hope. They all do so well. They are believable characters. Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development. Fisher does a fine job being a female role model (I mean	 come on! She killed Jabba even when so many others had failed!). Harrison Ford - need I say more?<br /><br />The music is once again brilliant. It's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts ""NOOO!"" and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle. John Williams is nothing short of a genius! What an amazing man!<br /><br />Already	 the movie has so much more meaning for me because of Episode I. I can't wait to finally see it in the theatres (CAN I WAIT???) and then watch the original trilogy yet again.<br /><br />Bravo!"	1.0
"Four teenage girls in a suburb of Los Angeles get into all kinds of trouble: parties	 drugs	 cops	 mixed-up parents	 older boyfriends. Jodie Foster	 sort of the mother hen of the pack	 tries keeping everyone together like ""a family"" (like the family unit she's never had)	 and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can't. Slowly	 everyone grows up and goes away. THAT precise plot point	 though underscored throughout	 is unfortunately tampered with. Did we really need a long sequence with Scott Baio outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard? Or an even longer sequence--also with Baio--where Foster has a strange soliloquy about the ""pain of illusion"". Some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy	 and I didn't much care for an edit late in the film that segues clumsily from a death to a wedding. But these are nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond. And Jodie's face at the ending speaks volumes. If viewers do get choked up at the end	 the movie has earned this. It doesn't pander for tears or ask for sympathy. It shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand. *** from ****"	1.0
"This film is beautiful to look at	 but is like watching really bad experimental theater. The plot (if there was one) doesn't make any sense. But it is very ""artistic"". Lots of shots of half-dressed actors wrestling and looking deep into each other's eyes. Lots of arty shots through windows and with people out of frame. Mumbling and people wandering wistfully. Lingering close-ups of faces and bodies. By the time you get to the threesome on the roof with the cat	 you'll be ready to throw a bottle of KY at the screen.<br /><br />It is supposed to be about a father and son's relationship	 but you will just be wishing the two of them would just f*$& each other and get it over with. If you have always wanted to see bad Russian gay porn without any money shots	 your wish has been granted."	0.0

"I watched this last night with low expectations. The reasons being	 I don't usually like ""made for TV"" movies and rarely have I liked ""cast reunion"" movies. But	 the critic in the Los Angeles Times seemed to like this	 so I gave it a chance. I'm glad I did. It was pretty good. Adam West and Burt Ward reunite as themselves. But	 in a way	 they were acting as their ""Batman and Robin"" selves. They were being campy and not taking themselves	 or this movie too seriously. The movie starts out with them searching for the ""George Barris"" designed Batmobile	 that someone stole before it was to be auctioned off for an orphan's home. While	 they are searching for the car	 they are also reminiscing about the series that they did together. This is told in flashback. It was well done. The actors that they got	 for the younger Burt Ward and Adam West were dead on. And	 for a TV movie	 it got down to the nitty-gritty about their real behavior on and off the screen. I give this one a 9/10	 I liked it that much."	1.0
"... And being let down bigger than ever before. I won't make any direct references or anything here	 but to say the least	 this film is pathetic. If you're military trained	 don't bother watching. I put it on the DVD with 2 friends wanting to watch a somewhat interesting action / war flick. Why couldn't I just have read the reviews first.<br /><br />Already at the first ""bomb"" scene the film has huge glitches	 and they continue to show and become bigger and bigger. My 2 friends	 not connected to the military in any way spotted a couple of the filmmaker's mistakes almost as fast as I myself did and asked me if some of the things going on we're realistic. Well	 as you might have guessed	 they're not - at all.<br /><br />Avoid this movie unless you're able to overlook these completely idiotic and re-occurring mistakes being made. 2/10 for catching my interest at first."	0.0
"Upon The Straight Story release in 1999	 it was praised for being David Lynch's first film that ignored his regular themes of the macabre and the surreal. Based on a true story of one man and his journey to visit his estranged brother on a John Deere '66 mower	 at first glance its an odd story for Lynch to direct. Yet as the story develops you can see some of Lynch's trademark motifs coming through.<br /><br />Lynch's focus on small town America and its inhabitants is still as prevalent as in his previous efforts such as Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks	 but the most notable difference is that the weirdness is curbed down. The restrictions imposed means that the film has the notable accolade of being one of the few live action films that I can think of that features a G rating. Incredibly significant	 this films stands as evidence that beautiful and significant family films can be produced.<br /><br />The Straight Story was the first feature which Lynch directed where he had no hand at writing. For many Lynch devotees this was a huge negative point. Almost universally acclaimed	 the only overly negative review by James Brundage of filmcritic.com focused on this very criticism	 that it wasn't a typical Lynch film. ""Lynch is struggling within the mold of a G-Rated story that isn't his own."" Brundage claims	 with his protagonist Alvin Straight ""quoting lines directly from Confucious."" He argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse. Yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film. Whilst it is true that it is not Lynch in the sense of Eraserhead	 Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive - all films which I also adore	 The Straight Story features a different side of Lynch that is by no means terrible. If you are a Lynch fan	 it is most important to separate that side of Lynch with this feature.<br /><br />The narrative is slow and thoughtful	 which gives you a real sense of the protagonist's thoughts as he travels to his destination. Alvin constantly is reminded about his past and his relationships with his wife	 children and his brother. Yet particularly significant is that there are no flashbacks	 which only adds to the effect	 which reminded me of my conversations with my grandparents. The conclusion arrives like watching a boat being carried down a slow meandering river and it is beautiful to watch. The natural landscapes of the US are accentuated and together with the beautiful soundtrack by Angelo Badalamenti	 makes me yearn to go to America. The performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and Richard Farnsworth is particularly excellent. His Oscar nomination was greatly deserved and it was a shame that he didn't win. Regardless	 however it is probably the finest swan-song for any actor. <br /><br />So whilst The Straight Story features none of Lynch's complex narratives or trademark dialogue	 the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended!"	1.0
"This movie is to Halloween what the hilarious ""Christmas Story"" is to Christmas: both are relatively low-budget	 no-big-name-stars type films...and both are two of the absolute greatest and funniest movies available	 both seasonal CLASSICS!!!

"Pretty good picture about a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time. If the murderer wanted to whack the dame	 why not just off her and let the cops try to figure out whodunnit? Involving all these characters in the plot is dangerous	 not to mention all the mouths you'd have to worry about staying shut. Why did the depressed lady go out to the bar when she could barely sit up in a chair or say a word? Are there really cops out there who are wise cracking	 gum popping	 grinning apes who approach a suspect in such a glib manner? This probably played well back before the wheel was invented	 but it is so corny and unbelievable today. Catch the manic drum break by Elisha Cook; his frenetic hammering never once matched the recording. His mad facial expressions made up for the off kilter stick sync."	1.0

"I'll be honest. The only reason I watched this one on TV is that it's in the IMDb bottom 100. And right now	 I'm wondering if the hour and a half of my life really was worth another 'check' on that same list.<br /><br />Van Damme is Luc Deveraux	 who finds himself on a huge fight with the Universal Soldiers after the main computer pulled a 'HAL' to defend itself. And yes	 after all the obligate explosions	 shoot-outs and chases he is the last one standing.

"A story of amazing disinterest kills ""The Psychic"" over and over again. The characters and plot are completely uninteresting (as is Fulci's mad camera work	 which is usually a redeeming factor in his films)	 and any grasp of suspense is nowhere to be found. It's padded out to an insufferable degree--by the end	 you won't be clamoring with excitement but stricken with boredom (and	 like me	 maybe an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance deserves occupancy in a better movie. Fulci gorehounds beware--there's just not much going on in ""The Psychic.""<br /><br />3/10"	0.0
"This movie has a few things going for it right off the bat. Having Dani Filth as a lead actor is automatically going to make some people like this movie. Admittedly	 I love Cradle of Filth and listened to the soundtrack to this movie long before I watched it. Dani Filth is a very recognizable character and makes for a great lead. The independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor. There are some GORGEOUS actresses in this movie. For being low budget	 the special effects weren't bad either. The ways that people died were very creative and nightmarish.<br /><br />Now on to the cons. There is VERY little talking throughout this whole movie	 thus making for very little as far as character development. It's hard to fear for the lives of limp	 static characters. When there was a little talking	 the F bomb was abundant	 popping up in random places. Yes	 I understand people swear but it seems like a preteen boy scripted this and thought himself cool for including all the language. The storyline	 what I could make out of it	 was pretty good although many parts are left dangling and the lack of conversation leaves one often wondering what's happening.<br /><br />In the end	 Cradle of Fear is like a porno for people who love sex and violence	 but like a porno trying to pull of a storyline	 it just doesn't work too well. Rent it though	 if you're a morbid person looking to sate your blood and flesh appetite."	0.0
"In 1996's ""101 Dalmatians	"" Cruella De Vil was arrested by the London Metropolitain Police (God bless them) for attempting to steal and murder 101 puppies - dalmatians.

"I think the majority of the people seem not the get the right idea about the movie	 at least that's my opinion. I am not sure it's a movie about drug abuse; rather it's a movie about the way of thinking of those genius brothers	 drugs are side effects	 something marginal. Again	 it's not a commercial movie that you see every day and if the author wanted that	 he definitely failed	 as most people think it's one of the many drug related movies. I	 however	 think something else is the case. As in many movies portraying different cultures	 audience usually fully understands movies portraying their own culture	 i.e. something they've grown up with and are quite familiar with. This movie is to show what those ""genius"" people very often think and what problems they face. The reason why they act like this is because they are bored out of their minds :) They have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept those things as if they are launching space shuttles on daily basis. They start a fairly hard job and excel in no time. They feel like- I went to work	 did nothing	 still did twice as better as the guys around me when they were all over their projects	 what should I do now with my free time. And what's even more boring? When you can start predicting behavior not because you're psychologist	 but instead because you have seen this pattern in the past. So	 for them	 from one side it's a non challenging job	 which is also fairly boring sometimes	 and from another they start to figure out people's behavior. It's a recipe for big big boredom. And the dumbest things are usually done to get out of this state. They guy earlier who mentioned that their biggest problem is that they are trying to figure out life in terms of logic (math describes logic)	 while life is not really a logical thing	 is actually absolutely right."	1.0
"A noble effort	 I guess	 but ultimately a poor one. Before seeing this film	 I felt ""Bartleby	 The Scrivener"" was unfilmable. After seeing it	 I still do. Unfortunately	 I think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on	 and they will be upset at the film's needless revisions (updating from 1850 to 1970	 moving from New York to London). Even the superb talents of Paul Scofield can't salvage what looks to me like a well meaning but misguided effort to film Melville's metaphysical classic."	0.0

"To say this film stinks would be insulting to skunks. As the other commenter says	 this movie is insulting to anyone over the mental age of 7 (it is especially	 incredibly insulting to gays). It is awful - and not in a ""so bad it's funny"" sort of way either - it's just plain awful. No	 I have to say it: IT STINKS! (sorry skunks).<br /><br />From the opening credits to the end titles there is hardly more than 10 seconds of this movie worth opening your eyes for. The ""plot"" is incoherent	 the characterization non-existent	 the acting is of the over the top mugging ""look at me I'm being funny!"" school and so it goes on. The set pieces are clumsily set up (if at all) and are badly executed	 it's just awful on every front - apart from the music maybe	 I don't remember thinking the music stinks (apart from the songs).<br /><br />To be fair to the makers	 they lay their cards on the table pretty quickly: the opening credits include the title ""Also starring Ertha Kitt as the voice of Betty the meteor"" (since as the meteor in question turns out never never say anything but make an occasional purring noise they may well have lifted Ms. Kitt's contribution from one of her records) and the second line of the movie runs something like: ""...and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around Uranus."" Uranus - ""Your Anus"" geddit? geddit? huh? huh?? Your Anus? The humour really is that cheap.<br /><br />It says strange things about the ""comedies"" of that period in that it was perfectly permissable for the hero to deliberately shoot people dead in the street but not say ""sh*t"" out loud.<br /><br />I paid fifty pence (about $1.00) for this movie in a sale.

"To confess having fantasies about Brad Pitt is a pretty tough admission for an heterosexual to make. But what can I tell you? Maybe is that famous extra something that everybody talks about and makes a star a star. It crosses that barrier. It pulls you into unknown sensual and emotional territory.

"Considering it was made on a low budget	 THE DAY TIME ENDED manages to make the most of its budget with some surprisingly good special effects work.<br /><br />The story involves a family who are about to move into their solar-powered home in an isolated part of the Mojave Desert in southwestern California	 only to find it trashed--by motorcycle vandals	 they think. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) has begun to see mysterious things--a green pyramid	 strange humanoid figures	 etc. And only recently	 the light from a trinary star explosion has caused extremely unusual auroras to show up in the desert skies. Thus the family	 led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone	 finds themselves face-to-face with strange alien forces who have put them in a time-and-space warp.<br /><br />Mixing in elements of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND	 THE DAY TIME ENDED	 despite its obvious flaws and uneven acting	 remains interesting due to the superb special effects work of David Allen. The desert setting is very appropriate for this film's close encounters; and while the movie cannot really be compared with either Kubrick's or Spielberg's films	 THE DAY TIME ENDED is much better than many other 2001/CLOSE ENCOUNTERS knock-offs. I give credit to director John 'Bud' Cardos	 whose 1977 thriller KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS made for an interesting precursor to ARACHNOPHOBIA	 for at least trying--and on that basis	 I give THE DAY TIME ENDED a 7 out of 10."	1.0
"College students	 who are clearing out a condemned dormitory	 are stalked by an elusive killer.<br /><br />The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans. The movies production values are pretty low and the story for the most part is pretty routine	 there's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring. In fact much of the story's build-up is pretty forgettable	 save for one or two brutal murders. But the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric setting) and one fairly bold	 unconventional conclusion.<br /><br />The cast is lackluster for the most part. Stephen Sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character. Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an ill-fated student.<br /><br />Over all this is a pretty standard B slasher effort	 but the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete ho-hum.<br /><br />** out of ****"	0.0
"I used to LOVE this movie as a kid but	 seeing it again 20+ years later	 it actually sucks. Up The Academy might have been ahead of it's time back in 1980	 but it has almost nothing to offer today! Movies like Caddyshack and Stripes hold-up much better today than this steaming dogpile. No T&A. No great jokes except for the one-liners we've all heard a million times by now.<br /><br />I recently bought the DVD in hopes that it would be the gem I remembered it being. Well	 I was WAY off! The soundtrack had only 2-3 widely-recognizable hits (not the smash compilation others had mentioned) and the frequent voice-overs were terrible.

"I have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film....the road side bar scene in Russia. In this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - ""50 Dollars..you Drink and Talk""	 but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing Russian accent than I could	 so I declined to take this speaking part on. I was slightly starstruck as this was my first Film experience....and who knows... these lines could have ended up there with lines such as ""I'll be Back"" and ""Quite Frankly My Dear	 I Don't Give a Damn"". Had I spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminium as 'Heavy 1' instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski. <br /><br />As time goes on	 I am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film.<br /><br />Even though I spent a whole day on the set	 in South Wales hot-spot Barry Island	 no one could tell me what the actual storyline was. The caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it..... things could certainly have been worse if I'd ended up naked in this most dreadful of films....<br /><br />Still.....On the positive side....I got chatting to Rhys Ifans during one break. I had no idea who he was	 as ""Notting Hill"" was yet to be released	 and not an inkling that he might be Welsh. Made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit Barry Island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s. It was only when Keith Allen showed up that I realised I was in a quality production........"	0.0
"Homelessness (or Houselessness as George Carlin stated) has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school	 work	 or vote for the matter. Most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism	 the war on Iraq	 pressuring kids to succeed	 technology	 the elections	 inflation	 or worrying if they'll be next to end up on the streets.<br /><br />But what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home	 the entertainment sets	 a bathroom	 pictures on the wall	 a computer	 and everything you once treasure to see what it's like to be homeless? That is Goddard Bolt's lesson.<br /><br />Mel Brooks (who directs) who stars as Bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival (Jeffery Tambor) to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries; if Bolt succeeds	 he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings. The bet's on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can't step off the sidewalk. He's given the nickname Pepto by a vagrant after it's written on his forehead where Bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of Molly (Lesley Ann Warren) an ex-dancer who got divorce before losing her home	 and her pals Sailor (Howard Morris) and Fumes (Teddy Wilson) who are already used to the streets. They're survivors. Bolt isn't. He's not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it's fight or flight	 kill or be killed.<br /><br />While the love connection between Molly and Bolt wasn't necessary to plot	 I found ""Life Stinks"" to be one of Mel Brooks' observant films where prior to being a comedy	 it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as Blazing Saddles	 Young Frankenstein	 or Spaceballs for the matter	 to show what it's like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don't know what to do with their money. Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like Monopoly money.<br /><br />Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others."	1.0
"it was and a simpler time ( the seventies )	 a simpler place ( San Francisco )	 where a man could make a simple movie about a drug crazed psychotic re-Crucifixion of Christ as a woman on acid with never ending dream sequences and inter cut flashbacks while having a multi-racial inter gender orgies regardless of financial responsibilities or moral repercussion.<br /><br />this movie	 tedious	 slow	 boring	 is the worst example of the kind of pretentious heavy handed art school dreck that passed as art in the midst of the 70's. and i love it ! once this train wreck of endless slow motion zoom ins and heavy reverbed echo chamber acid guitar licks starts you can't take your eyes off of it until the ridiculous and absurd end. its kind of a cross between Jesus Christ superstar	 beyond the valley of the dolls	 and a really crappy acid trip with your parents on a water bed. its simultaneously a train wreck	 completely fascinating	 and also a great snapshot of the worst ( or best ) elements of b-grade seventies phychadelic film genre.<br /><br />the plot.<br /><br />I'll just tell you the plot because you will hardly be able to tell whats happening due to the constant cross edited flashbacks to events that may or may not have happened to characters that may or may not be themselves	 and the face painted hippy freak nicks endlessly cavorting about in banal sequences of performance art level mime like street theater.<br /><br />""Logan"" is a really annoying iconoclast film maker who yells at people allot and is surrounded by a mostly silent film crew who are always dropping acid and having what seem like really bad orgies. Richard Dreyfus has an ancillary role as what seems like the accountant. the film crew seems to hate him for some reason and break out into maniacal laughter perhaps to torment him. ""Suzanne"" the titular character is a willowy blond who stairs vacuously into space and comforts the totally insane ""artist"" character. ""the artist"" is going completely mad	 by the way. either from his hamfisted overacting or the incredible awfulness of his paintings. all of course terrible nudes of Susanne. there are some other characters that randomly show up	 a cigar chomping ""the man"" character. who also is all hot for Suzanne i guess. he has a monologue. i couldn't really ever figure out what he had to do with the story except everyone had to hate ""the man"" back then and you couldn't make a movie without one. there is also a mute girl. the mute girl pays off in the end trust me	 its incredibly stupid."	0.0
"If you want Scream or anything like the big-studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother. This well-written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say. Importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense	 how children interpret the world (and the violence in it)	 our ransacking of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends.. all here	 but not flatly on the surface. You could technically call it a ""monster movie"" even though the Wendigo does not take physical form until the end	 and then it's even up to you and your beliefs as to what's happening with the legendary spirit/beast. Some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the basics and the film never bores	 though in fact the less you see of the creature	 the better. Fessenden successfully continues George Romero's tradition of using the genre as parable and as a discussion forum while still keeping us creeped out."	1.0
"The story is extremely unique.It's about these 2 pilots saving Earth from alien beings but they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them age rapidly.The whole series is about the pilots dealing with the loss of time	friends	and mentors.<br /><br />The ending COULD have been fantastic.It started to end on a total down note and leave a real mark but instead ended on a super happy Disney note and annoyed me VERY bad.<br /><br />The animation is decent for 89 but can't compare to nowadays.I have also heard many complain about the cheesiness of the nudity.I actually found it to be somewhat decent.The nudity for the most part was warranted except in episode 2 where there was an excess.<br /><br />Overall it deserves a look but the ending keeps it from being a classic."	1.0
"I am writing this review having watched it several months ago....the trailer looked promising enough for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie. It is a complete joke....and literally a spit in the face of real classics of the early generation of horror like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) which they even had the gall to compare itself to on the back of the cover art. The producer who played Brandon should go flip burgers and serve up greasy hamburgers....hell he might not even be good at that either! The lighting was bad bad bad and a big annoyance through out the film you couldn't even see the actor's faces sometimes. I don't even remember the rest of the cast members which is sad really	 bad they never do anything to impress you to make them memorable. That's all the time I will waste on this review PLEASE stay as far away as you can from this pile of junk even if you get it for 25 cents don't do it buy s piece of gum at least IT would keep you entertained!<br /><br />If you want good quality low budget fun	 far better than this... then check out a Jeff Hayes film....because it takes talent to make it in horror and the kid has it!<br /><br />I gave this 1 star just for the cover art....thats the only thing worth liking abut this so called ""film""<br /><br />-Rick Blalock"	0.0
"""True"" story of three girls who go into the wilds of Connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods. This is the sort of film that would have played in the drive ins across America thirty years ago to mixed acclaim. Not particularly much of anything the film works with its low budget to mixed results. The film is watchable but isn't at all scary (blame how some of the attack scenes for that). Its the sort of film that you'll probably forget about once you're done with it. Odds are that you're never going to think to see this unless its handed to you by someone and told	 ""here watch this""	 which is what happened to me. If you're handed a copy give it back	 the film isn't worth the effort to see it even if it is watchable."	0.0
"The Old Mill Pond is more of a tribute to the African-American entertainers of the '30s than any denigration of the entire race (Stepin Fetchit caricature notwithstanding). Besides who I just mentioned	 there's also frog or fish versions of Cab Calloway	 Fats Waller	 Joesphine Baker	 Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson	 and Louis Armstrong. This Happy Harmonies cartoon from Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising is very entertaining musically with perfect characterizations all around. They all sound so much like the real thing that half of me thinks they could possibly be. If not	 they're certainly very flattering impersonations. Even the lazy	 shiftless Fetchit characterization gets an exciting workout here when he gets chased by a tiger as ""Hold That Tiger"" plays on the score. Highly recommended for fans of '30s animation and jazz music."	1.0
"This is the kind of movie which shows the paucity of French cinema when it comes to making thrillers.The director's desire to ""sound American"" is so glaring that you will not be fooled a minute	unless you have not seen a serial killer movie since ""Peeping Tom"".<br /><br />Two male cops (or one and a half	more like	as you will see)	horrible murders	a plot more complicated than complex.Charles Berling is not lucky with the genre(see the astoundlingly dumb ""l'inconnu de Strasbourg"" a couple of years ago).The scenes with his pregnant wife -which are supposed to be a counterpart for the otherwise noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot-are among the worst ever filmed.Add a steamy love scene between them and a gory autopsy to get a PG 12 and thus to attract the huge adolescent audience.A violent and absurd conclusion	followed by a silent epilogue who could make a nice commercial for the côte d'azur	it's really the silence of the lame."	0.0
"In addition to being an extremely fun movie	 may I add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful. This kind	 fun loving woman had a great deal of money. Unfortunately	 she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on her money. This woman was lonely since the death of her husband. He had proposed to her in a theater that was going to be torn down. To prevent that	 she bought it. Her daughters were afraid she was throwing away ""their"" money and decided to take action. The character actors in this film were a great plus also. I would give almost anything to have a copy of this film in my video library	 but as of yet	 it's never been released. Sad."	1.0
"This movie took the Jerry Springer approach to super-human power. ""Wilder Napalm"" is the kind of theme-based movie that I love	 addressing the idea that prodigies in America are defined either by their gifts or by attempts to hide them. At the same time	 the movie points out that every prodigy is only human	 and no more to be feared or worshipped than any other human being. This was a great comedy	 fun and human with that slight satiric edge."	1.0
"This film exceeded my expectations. I thought and have heard that it was going to be rubbish	 so i wasn't expecting much. However	 i was pleasantly surprised. At first i didn't take well to the lead girl and didn't really care if she lived or died. After a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character. It's not just some slasher film where people die for no reason. There is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the film	 but explains a lot. I would recommend this film to everyone. If you're not sure just watch it anyway	 it's only an hour and a half of your life. You're going to live for 80 years anyway."	1.0
"and anyone who watches this film will agree. This film was directed in the days when plot	 character believability and theme actually mattered.<br /><br />Jean Peters	 Widmark	 and Thelma Ritter steal the spotlight. Ritter is in top form as informer ""Moe"" she survives in the Bowery section of NY	 acting as a stool pigeon for NYC police.<br /><br />The only other film in which I have seen Peters is ""Niagara""	 and she certainly proves her acting ability here	 complete with Brooklyn accent. Widmark is appropriately menacing	 as the anti-hero who must discern what the right thing is	 despite his need for cash.<br /><br />The photography is brilliant. The neon	 the subway station (though it looks cleaner than the real thing!) the harbor shack where Widmark lives as a transient. Excellent use is made of the city	 with ""Lightning Louie"" in Chinatown; the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here; the political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop. 10/10."	1.0
"I have had the pleasure of reading Martin Torgoff's book ""Can't Find My Way Home"" which is chock full of info on the drug culture of America	 spanning the years 1945-2000. This guy knows his stuff!! I found him to be an excellent spokesperson for this documentary. I particularly enjoyed watching the film clips from the hippie era	 and the 70's stoner culture. The soundtrack was excellent. Whoever compiled it definitely was in touch with the tunes of each era. Hopefully they will package them and sell them as a CD set. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960's experiments with LSD forever changed American culture as we know it. One thing that was missing was any mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie ""Blow"")	 who was supposedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine coming into this country in the 60's-80's."	1.0

"I don't quite know how to explain ""Darkend Room	"" because to summarize it wouldn't really do it justice. It's a quintessentially Lynchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange	 mysterious situation. I would say this short is definitely more on the ""Mulholland Drive"" end of the Lynchian spectrum	 as opposed to ""The Elephant Man"" or ""The Straight Story."" It's hidden on Lynch's website	 and well worth the search."	1.0
"Hint number one - read the title as ""the Time of the Mad Dog	"" or perhaps dogs. This is a pretty good ensemble piece (look at the cast and rent it - you know you're curious already)	 and first-time director Bishop gives them their chance	 taking his time	 letting the characters interact and chew the scenery as they wait - not enthusiastically - for the return of ""the big boss"" and whatever revenge ensues.<br /><br />For some of us	 the highlight is seeing Christopher Jones after his self-imposed exile from films; he remains a commanding film presence. And yes	 with Christopher Jones	 Larry Bishop and Richard Pryor involved	 this IS the ""Wild in the Streets"" reunion party!"	1.0
"It was clear right from the beginning that 9/11 would inspire about as many films as World War II and Vietnam combined; however	 there is certainly a big danger that most of these films to come are about as good (or rather: bad) as Pearl Harbor. It is a great luck that the first international release about 9/11 is not a cheesy love story starring a bunch of pretty faces	 but a collective work of 11 directors from the entire world.<br /><br />I'm not intending to say that all 11 episodes are great (Youssef Chahine's	 for example	 has a needless prologue with too many cuts and Shohei Imamura's has a really bizarre ending) or that the segments are in the right order (Imamura's	 being the only one not referring directly to the Twin Towers	 should open the film	 not end it	 Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu's should be the last one instead	 as it's the most impressive one). But it is an impressing effort and an interesting portrayal of the way other parts of the world react to the collapse of the twin towers.<br /><br />Consider Samira Makhmalbaf's opening segment	 in which an Afghan teachers tries to explain to her pupils what happened in New York and unsuccessfully suggests a one-minute silence. Or Idrissa Ouedraogo's part (which features a bin Laden-double so much resembling the real one that you'll be shocked when you see him	 I promise)	 in which 5 boys muse about good things that can be done with the reward put out on Laden.<br /><br />There's a surprisingly good (and extremely angry) segment by Ken Loach about a man from Chile talking about what he calls ""our Tuesday September 11"" - that September 11 in 1973 when their elected president Allende was killed and Pinochet installed his dictatorship - with the generous help from Henry Kissinger and the CIA. This could have become a terrible effort in Anti-Americanism	 but it did become a sad tale and shares my recognition for the best segment with Inarritu's (mainly sound impressions and phone calls from the hijacked planes to a black screen	 sometimes a few pictures of people falling down the WTC and finally a collapsing tower	 ending with the screen brightening up and one question appearing) and Amos Gitai's about a hysterical reporter trying desperatly to get on air after a car bomb exploded in Tel Aviv (hard to recognize	 but this one is a masterpiece of choreography).<br /><br />All these different segments (I haven't mentioned yet Claude Lelouch's about a deaf girl	 Danis Tanovic's about a demonstration of the Women of Srebrenica	 Mira Nair's - strange	 but it takes an Indian director to make the part that is probably most appealing to Western tastes - about a Muslim family whose son is under a terrible suspicion after 9/11 and Sean Penn's with Ernest Borgnine (yes	 Ernest Borgnine) as a widower leading the most depressive life one can imagine) add up to a unique film not easy to watch and hard to forget. I am sure this film will be a classic known to everyone thirty years from now. I hope it will be remembered for starting a long tradition of world cinema movies. But	 alas	 it's far more probable it will be remembered as a one-film-only effort. And as the one of the few 9/11 movies made by then that don't reduce this terrible event to a love story with a happy end just to please the audience."	1.0
"Putting the UFO ""thing"" aside. This was the best documentary I've seen. Factual reporting by Neil and Buzz... a must see. The interviews and reporting are a revelation since most of the information was stamped confidential in 1969 and only released in 2006. No documentary to date has the detail or accuracy for such a brief 47 minutes... The FACTS will blow you away	 and you will be left in awe of the risks taken to be the first on the moon... Neil and Buzz are probably the biggest hero's of our time. Ever see a man save his own life? Bet not. Neil saves his life when only mili-seconds separated him from death. Amazing to watch. It is a travesty people have not known all the details assosiated with landing on the moon and the courage those men had when facing certain death	 from a failing computer... 10 stars!"	1.0
"About two hundred members of a Cleveland	 Ohio USA film society	 named Cinematheque	 gathered on August 19	 2000 to view a pristine Cinemascope print of Michelangelo Antonioni's 1970 film	 ""Zabriskie Point."" Cinematheque Director John Ewing	 who does a superlative job of obtaining the finest prints for his series	 shared with the audience beforehand that this print was specially flown over from Italy for this one showing only.<br /><br />The audience was held spellbound as the film unfolded its artisty on the huge panoramic screen. Watching this superb print	 shown the way Antonioni intended	 made one aware that this is indeed a modern art work. It was all the more fitting that the series is housed in the Cleveland Insititue of Art in University Circle. <br /><br />Antonioni's compositions are created for the Cinemascope landscape. His beautiful balancing of images	 striking use of colors	 sweeping choreographic movements	 all are the work of a genuine artist	 using the screen as his canvas. <br /><br />At last the audience could understand ""Zabriskie Point."" As its narrative unfolded	 it became obvious that this work is not about story per se	 but rather an artist's impressionistic rendering of fleeting images of his subject. The setting of some of the more turbulent activities of the sixties provides only a dramatic motor for the artist's sweeping collage. <br /><br />Antonioni is not bound by conventional narrative standards	 and can pause at any point to creatively embroider an event with grandiose embellishments. The audience willingly went with the flow of his remarkable imagination	 as his huge images on the massive canvas held one in rapt attention. While the audience may have been only tangentially involved in character relationships	 it realized the theme here is human aleination	 the director's recurring theme. <br /><br />It was also realized that no print any smaller or of lesser quality than this original one in Cinemascope can do justice to this particular rendering. The audience was therefore all the more appreciative of viewing ""Zabriskie Point"" in its original	 breathtaking format	 and broke into thunderous applause at the end."	1.0
"I'm fond of this film and it vexes me that so many ""reviewers"" rank it below the Peter Jackson trilogy. A filmed novel is always interpretive; in particular an animated film relies on the artist's vision and should be judged on its own terms. Speaking as a purist	 this is a finer homage to Tolkien than the updated version. While this film has its flaws it stays truer to the source	 especially so far as the characters are concerned.<br /><br />In the Jackson version Tolkien's Frodo is barely recognizable: from the first scenes he is portrayed as a weakling	 constantly wavering	 manipulated by forces around him and never standing on his own two feet (this is physically and metaphorically true.) You wonder why fate chose this limp biscuit to carry the one ring to the Cracks of Doom. Jackson unforgivably rewrites Tolkien and robs Frodo of his finest moment when he allows Arwen to rescue him from the Ringwraiths...Bakshi's version respects the original	 presenting a Frodo who demands the wraiths ""Go back and trouble me no more!"" Bakshi sustains Frodo's character as Tolkien conceived it. We see his decline as the weight of his burden increases. Frodo is so pivotal to Lord of the Rings you wonder why Jackson took such liberties (he does so with numerous characters)since character development propels the plot to its inevitable conclusion. Bakshi's film better explores the companionship between Legolas and Gimli in a few judicious scenes that are completely lacking in Jackson's version. Similarly we see Boromir horsing with Pippin and Merry	 furthering the idea of fellowship. For my liking the camaraderie is more developed in the animated version than the live action.<br /><br />Tolkien's poetry is an important ingredient in the novels and Bakshi makes tribute to this in one of my favorite scenes: when Frodo sings the ""Merry Old Inn"" song	 minutes before stumbling into Strider. The cheery tune is chillingly juxtaposed with the darker theme music when seconds later	 invisible to his friends but visible to the wraiths	 Frodo is dangerously exposed. This is one of the most atmospheric portions of the film and chills me whenever I see it.<br /><br />The well documented budget/time restrictions limit this film's final impact but had it been completed it may have resonated with more viewers. As it is	 it's worth a look. Even its detractors admit that Peter Jackson derived much of his inspiration from this prototype."	1.0

"Ben & Arthur COULD have been a 10. Sam Mraovich wrote	 directed	 stared	 and produced this movie.

"SOLDIER is not as bad as many have made it out to be. I found the film to have some of the sacarstic	 cynical humour like that in Paul Verhoven's Starship Troopers. The lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic-book atmosphere.<br /><br />One particular trivia-bit stands out for me - Todd has the names of several space-war campaigns tattoo'd onto his chest and one of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE. For the oblivious ones out there	 Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in Roy Batty's elegiac last lines in Blade Runner. To imagine that Todd could have fought alongside android troops like Roy is mind boggling to say the least. Maybe script writer David Peoples was nostalgic?<br /><br />I'll give this one 3 out of 5."	1.0
"I consider this film to be the best one about Mike Hammer	 with Biff Elliott's performance the definitive Mike Hammer. Harry Essex's script is excellent and contains many improvements on Mickey Spillane's novel. His direction is strong and imaginative	 and he makes fine use of light and shadow. The camera work by John Alton is top-notch	 as is the score by Franz Waxman. The cast includes many veteran players	 as well as Peggie Castle in her memorable performance as Charlotte Manning. All in all	 this is one of the finest private eye films ever made. Biff Elliott and Haary Essex should have received more opportunities. I have always treasured this film."	1.0
"I don't think a movie like this would be released today. It takes it's time to present the depth of the characters and the plot isn't full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />But	 what this film does have: an interesting study in how families' deal with grief. How when the language for healing and over-coming tremendous loss leaves us mute	 and we rely on raw emotions instead. Grief without reason and patience is anger	 even hate. And unfortunately	 the lead character (a young boy who accidently shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the film is given more than his fair share of it. He eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who makes it clear to him that it WAS an accident. I got the impression that this young man knew that in his heart	 but needed to hear those words from his parents	 and to receive their forgiveness.<br /><br />What I loved about this film: the lack of dialog. There was a tremendous emphasis on physical reaction	 facial expressions. And the slower pace of the film allows you to really watch the reactions of the actors. Something we don't get to do alot of with today's films.<br /><br />"	1.0

"This movie is based on the art of Frank Frazetta	 the mythical fantasy illustrator. Some of the characters are straight out of his paintings (the Death Dealer being the best example). Surprisingly	 the animation manages to keep the feeling of the original art. Bakshi is well known for his heavy use of rotoscope (the technique of tracing a live action sequence) and this film is no exception. However	 since the subject of the movie is quite realistic (all characters are humans)	 this works pretty well.<br /><br />But what I really like here is the plot: for once we have a story with interesting characters and nice action sequences	 a really hideous villain and a gorgeous babe. This movie has the feeling of the best Conan comics	 not surprisingly since Roy Thomas is the writer of the Marvel series of our favourite Cimmerian! This is a far cry from the crappy live action Conan	 not to speak of all the B-movie of the genre.<br /><br />Definitely recommended!"	1.0
"I must admit	 there are few books with corresponding movies that I have actually read before seeing the cinematic adaptation. Nineteen Eighty-Four happens to be one of those rare cases. The book was great. It was immersive and interestingly prophetic. But the movie just plain sucked. It is easily the worst film I have ever seen. The only reason I didn't turn it off after the first 5 minutes was the fact that watching the movie was half of a two-part assignment for a class. It was dark and grotesque	 but did nothing in the way of achieving the proper atmosphere. The acting was nothing above average	 and considering the fact that there wasn't much to act out	 this was severely disappointing. The book	 for example	 didn't give me the impression that Winston was unable to blurt out more than a single syllable at a time. Boring	 disturbing	 and visually unappealing	 the movie totally cannibalized the book. Wait a second...Isn't it British?"	0.0
"There's a lot of good that can be said for this cartoon; the backgrounds are rich	 lushly colored and full of nicely done art deco details. The animation is up to the usual studio standards of the time	 which are unquestionably higher than those of the present day. However	 I find it tedious for a number of reasons.<br /><br />The Music: It's definitely not up to Scott Bradley's usual standards. Although it's probably supposed to be evocative of a ""Great Gatsby"" setting	 it ends up being dreary	 sleepy	 repetitious AND monotonous (repetitious and monotonous are not the same	 as Beethoven's 5th Symphony attests). Since most people (including me) tend to close their eyes when they yawn	 there's a lot of the visual part of the cartoon that will be missed by the average viewer.<br /><br />The Storyline: I'm not giving away any secrets that aren't already in the plot summary - country good	 city bad. This is a common theme in films	 both animated and live	 from this era. It's a misplaced nostalgia for a nonexistent rural idyll	 which	 in the present day	 is reflected in a similar nostalgia for ""values"" that never were."	0.0
"The Gospel of Lou was a major disappointment for me. I had received an E-Mail from the theater showing it that it was a great and inspirational movie. It was neither great nor inspirational. The cinematography was pretty iffy with the whole movie. A lot the scenes were flash backs that were done in a way that couldn't tell at times what they were about. The voices were often distorted for no reason. Also many of the people in the movie were far fetched. The relationship he has with his ex & son is never made clear. Also the whole movie has most him one way	 and then all of a sudden BAM	 he is cured and inspiring people. The whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the things that is bad in his life	 making him live his life the way that he is living it	 but when he changes	 he doesn't leave boxing	 he teaches others how to box. Thumbs Down."	0.0
"If you cannot enjoy a chick flick	 stop right now. If	 however	 you enjoy films that illustrate complex characters and provide extraordinary acting	 read on.<br /><br />Ann Grant Lord is dying. Her two daughters arrive to be at her bedside. Ann begins talking about people from her past of whom the daughters are unaware	 and they question as to whether these lost acquaintances are real or imagined. They come to realize that these people from their mother's past are	 indeed	 real.<br /><br />The story shifts	 basically	 between 1953 and circa 2000 with a few glimpses at Ann's life between those years. It was in 1953 that Ann met the love of her life and experienced her life's greatest tragedy.<br /><br />One of Ann's two best friends from college	 Lila	 is being married. Ann's other best friend is Lila's brother	 Buddy. Lila and Buddy are the children of a rich Newport family	 whereas Ann is a cabaret singer living in Greenwich Village who wants to be a free spirit but is still bound by many of those 1950's conventions.<br /><br />Soon after Ann arrives to be maid of honor at Lila's wedding	 she meets the person who will become the pivotal character in the lives of the three - Harris. He is the adult son of a former servant of the family who grew up with Lila and Buddy and has gone on to become a physician in a small New England town. Ann immediately becomes enamored of Harris which adds a complication to the fact that Lila has always been in love with Harris and continues to be. Buddy	 also	 is in love with Harris	 but being 1953	 he has redirected that homosexual desire for Harris to his good friend	 Ann for he cannot admit to himself that he has a sexual craving for another man. Buddy exhibits his inner frustration outwardly by being the alcoholic	 wise-cracking bad boy of the family - much to the chagrin of his very proper and uptight parents.<br /><br />Needless to say	 all of these expressed and repressed emotions lead to tragedy - after all this is a chick flick.<br /><br />In the present time	 Ann's daughters have become distant from their mother and are suffering their own life realizations and doubts. Constance is working to emotional exhaustion trying to keep up her roll as perfect mother and wife. Nina	 having always felt inferior	 cannot maintain a relationship.<br /><br />Stir all of these relationships into a span of fifty years	 and you get an intriguing look at society	 its values	 and its effects upon the personalities and actions of the complex people involved.<br /><br />All of the acting in Evening is excellent	 but there are some extraordinary performances and scenes - along with two unique family relationships - that make this film so very	 very special.<br /><br />Claire Danes plays the 1950's Ann	 and she does it in a style that clearly shows an intelligent woman of those times who is conflicted by what she is supposed to do as opposed to what she wants to do. Her performance is not easily forgettable.<br /><br />Vanessa Redgrave plays the dying Ann whose mind shifts from the present	 to the past	 to flights of fantasy	 and of course	 Redgrave pulls it all off with sterling style.<br /><br />Natasha Richardson - Redgrave's real daughter - plays Ann's daughter	 Constance	 in the film. The scenes between this real life mother and daughter playing fictional mother and daughter are an insightful treat to watch.<br /><br />Toni Collette plays Ann's other daughter	 Nina. Nina spends a good deal of her time being depressed and feeling sorry for herself while shutting out a good man who loves her as well as her mother and sister. Collette is perfect for a part such as this	 but I have never seen her give a bad or unbelievable performance no matter what part she plays.<br /><br />Mamie Gummer plays 1950's Lila and shows us a woman even more conflicted of her expected role in life than her good friend	 Ann. She is very good.<br /><br />Meryl Streep - Gummer's mother - plays present day Lila. What is there to say about Meryl Streep other than she always gives an insightful and rewarding performance.<br /><br />Director Lajos Koltai states in the DVD extras that he sought out Glenn Close to play the relatively small part of Lila's mother because he felt she was the only actress he could think of to play one scene in the film. He certainly was right	 and Close's performance in that one scene etches it in your mind. All the other scenes in which Close is Lila's very proper mother	 and you get another performance to treasure.<br /><br />There are three other scenes in the film	 combined with the one featuring Close described above	 that make the whole movie worth watching. On Lila's wedding day	 Ann comes into her room and crawls into to bed with her friend to discuss Lila's misforgivings about her upcoming wedding to a man she clearly does not love. This scene is repeated fifty years later when Lila comes and crawls into bed with her dying friend Ann to talk about the lives they have lived. In this latter scene	 Streep and Redgrave are enthralling.<br /><br />The other memorable scene - at least to me - is when Buddy declares his love for Ann. Hugh Dancy as Buddy gives us a heartbreaking performance of a young man torn apart by his conflicting sexual feelings. His performance is superior.<br /><br />Chick flick? Yes. A very special film with unbelievable acting	 directing	 and scenery? Definitely. I cannot recommend Evening too much."	1.0
"Easily one of the ten best movies of the 20th century. In Cold Blood is brilliant in the simplicity and realism of its storytelling	 and absolutely riveting.<br /><br />Robert Blake walks away with the film. The story seems to be presented almost entirely from Perry's viewpoint	 despite Dick being the leader and planner of the pair. The viewer will invariable perceive Dick as being more unstable	 immature	 and generally feel like Perry would not have been pulled into this nightmare but for Dick and his need to be somebody and pull off a big score.<br /><br />Based on a true story with particular attention to accuracy	 In Cold Blood depicts the story behind the brutal and senseless murder of a rural Kansas family one cold	 windy night	 because Dick has bought into an age-old rural myth about prosperous farmers having a safe full of cash in their home. As ""prosecutor"" (a character that isn't given a name in the script)	 played by Will Geer	 so astutely points out	 their lives are bought for only $10 a head. Director Richard Brooks wisely chooses not to share with us the gruesome details of the murders until the end of the film	 prior to this we only know it has happened and watch the lives of Dick and Perry slowly unravel as they attempt to escape not only being apprehended by law enforcement	 but also Perry's own ever-escalating sense of impending doom. He repeatedly makes remarks	 ""No one ever gets away with a thing like that	"" and ""I can't help thinking we left something behind that belongs to us."" Dick is neither mature nor moral enough to feel any compelling sense of guilt over their crime	 only irritation at Perry's. Indeed	 after they are caught	 it is Dick who breaks first	 and suddenly faints when finally confronted with irrefutable proof that places the two men at the scene of the crime. I felt somewhat sorry for Perry from the very beginning of the film	 and more-so as events progressed	 but I only loathed Dick.<br /><br />The genius of the film is the engaging manner in which the story is played. We do not for a moment think we are watching actors portray characters	 but that we are watching the actual participants and events as they occurred. The story is unrelenting	 taunt	 the run time slightly in excess of two hours feels more like just a few minutes.<br /><br />For those of you who are interested in such things	 I noticed a couple of the ""Goofs"" listed here on the IMDb page for In Cold Blood are incorrect or exaggerated. Such as the ""reversed"" process shot	 at the beginning of the film	 as Dick and Perry are driving across the bridge into Kansas. To begin with	 this isn't even a process shot	 the camera is actually positioned in the backseat and the image you see beyond the windshield of the car is real. A large cargo truck located to the left front of Dick's Pontiac creates the optical illusion that they are going backward because it is traveling at a greater rate of speed	 but closer examination will reveal that they are indeed going forward and it is an actual shot filmed from a moving vehicle. <br /><br />As I previously stated	 this is one of the ten best works of 20th century cinema	 not recommended for the very young due to some course language and implied and inferred violence (no actual in your face gore as a modern film would resort to)	 but a thoroughly excellent film."	1.0
"This movie provided NOTHING new or worthwhile. After seeing it	 my wife and I both agreed that the studio simply churned this out and could have cared less if it was entertaining. This is a good example of a ""concept only"" film--they have a concept about a film and the other details are unimportant because execs KNOW it will make $$ just based on the initial concept.<br /><br />The movie starts with Cruella getting out of prison and going on parole. She no longer hates puppies but has been programmed to adore them--she simply couldn't hurt a flea. This doesn't last too long after her release and she's back to her old ways. Period.<br /><br />The most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters. Eric Idle as the voice of Waddlesworth the bird made me HATE him--and that is TOUGH considering I am a die-hard Python fan. It was obvious he did this because they gave him lots of money (there can't be any other reason). Cruella's low self-esteem servant	 Tim McInnerny	 was funny in the Black Adder shows but here he is totally wasted and unfunny. And it must have cost a few bucks to get Gérard Depardieu but he was utterly wasted as well. There were some other supporting actors as well but given how poorly written the characters were	 I am trying to block them out of my mind.<br /><br />Overall	 you'd be better just to let your kids watch television than bother letting them see this drivel."	0.0
"Rating: 4 out of 10<br /><br />As this mini-series approached	 and we were well aware of it for the last six months as Sci-Fi Channel continued to pepper their shows with BG ads	 I confess that I felt a growing unease as I learned more.<br /><br />As with any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time	 different people go to it to see different things. In this regard	 when people think of Battlestar Galactica	 they remember different things. For some it is the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor. For others	 it is the fondness that they held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time. Many forget the state of special effects during the late 70s	 especially those on television. For some the memories resolve around the story arc. Others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they faced.<br /><br />Frankly	 I come from the latter group. The core of Battlestar Galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire. Yes	 evil. The Cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of the human race yet they did it. While base stars were swirling around	 men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources	 and somehow they managed to survive until the next show. They didn't survive because they had better technology	 or more fire power. They survived because they cared for and trusted each other to get through to the next show.<br /><br />The show had its flaws	 and at times was sappy	 but they were people you could care about.<br /><br />The writers of this current rendition seemed to never understand this. In some ways he took the least significant part of the original show	 the character's names and a take on the story arc and crafted what they called nothing less than a reinvention of television science fiction. Since that was their goal	 they can be judged on how well they accomplished it: failure. It was far from a reinvention. In fact it was in many ways one of the most derivitive of science fiction endeavors in a long time. It borrows liberally from ST:TNG	 ST:DS9	 Babylon 5	 and even Battlefield Earth. I find that unfortunate.<br /><br />Ronald D. Moore has been a contributor to popular science fiction for more than a decade	 and has made contribution to some of the most popular television Science Fiction that you could hope to see. One of the difficulties that he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of the Enterprise D & E. That was the inviolable rule of Roddenberry's ST:TNG. Like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority	 Ron Moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the acknowledged science fiction master: Gene Roddenberry. Here	 instead of writing the best story possible	 he has created a dysfuntional cast as I have ever seen with the intent of creating as much cast conflict as he could. Besides being dysfunctional	 some of it was not the least bit believable. Anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone unprovokedly striking a superior officer would not get just a couple of days ""in hack	"" they could have gotten execution	 and they never would have gotten out the next day. It wouldn't have happened	 period	 especially in time of war.<br /><br />The thing that I remembered most of Ron Moore's earlier work was that he was the one who penned the death of Capt. James Kirk. He killed Capt. Kirk	 and	 alas for me	 he has killed Battlestar Galactica."	0.0
"Carla works for a property developer's where she excels in being unattractive	 unappreciated and desperate. She is also deaf.<br /><br />Her boss offers to hire in somebody to alleviate her heavy workload so she uses the opportunity to secure herself some male company. Help arrives in the form of Paul	 a tattooed hoodlum fresh out of prison and clearly unsuited to the mannered routine of an office environment.<br /><br />An implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and Carla is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week. When Carla is edged out of an important contract she was negotiating by a slimy colleague she exploits Paul's criminality by having him steal the contract back. The colleague quickly realises that she's behind the robbery	 but when he confronts her	 Paul's readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too - but this thuggery comes at a price. <br /><br />Paul is given a 'going over' by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt. He formulates a plan which utilises Carla's unique lip reading abilities to rip-off a gang of violent bank robbers. It's now Carla's turn to enter a frightening new world.<br /><br />The fourth feature from director Jacques Audiard	 'READ MY LIPS' begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners. The leads are excellent; effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect. Carla's first meeting with Paul is an enjoyable farce in which she attempts to circumnavigate his surly reticence and jailbird manners only to discover that he was	 until very recently	 a jailbird. Emmanuelle Devos	 who plays Carla	 has that almost exclusive ability to go from dowdy to gorgeous and back again within a frame. Vincent Cassel plays Paul as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when he's receiving a beating or concocting the rip-off that is likely to get him killed.<br /><br />Like many French films	 'READ MY LIPS' appears	 at first	 to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that it's probably about everything. The only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of Paul's parole officer; a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood cul-de-sac.<br /><br />It was the French 'New Wave' of the 60's that first introduced the concept of 'genre' to film making and I've always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it; so it's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre	 or better still	 defy it."	1.0
"Final Score (an average of various classic cinematic qualities- acting	 visuals	 creativity	 payoff	 humor	 fun	 ect):<br /><br />4.3 (out of 10)<br /><br />Had ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" come out a few years ago it would have seemed like a bold	 serious new direction in Disney animation. However	 it comes just a year after the innovative and nearly genius ""The Emperor's New Groove"" and marks a step back in freeing Disney from it's repetative ""Disney Formula"". I'm a big fan of the feature length Disney animated films. Have to see them all love it or hate it. ""Atlantis"" is an animated throwback to ""20	000 Leagues Under the Sea"" and similar live-action sci-fi adventures of the 50s and 60s. Problem is that this version hardly contains one original idea. It feels like a remake of something	 even more so than actual Disney remakes(Tarzan	 The Hunchback of Notre Dame). The characters are little more than a walking cliches of the usual suspects that typically populate these type of films (the oddball mechanic	 the gung ho general	 the sassy tough women). Beyond Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner) the supporting cast is flat-out obnoxious. The movie also suffers from it's succinct pace. Instead of fleshing it out into an epic story	 Disney jams a lot in the usually brief running time brushing over opportunities to develop...suspence	 characters	 anything really. They thow us into this new and wonderous world and barely let us get our barings. The awkward pace sometimes makes confusing what is a relatively simple story. The animation is dark and dreary and cheap. This thing looks like a slapped together saturday morning cartoon. Let's hope they haven't forgotten that 2D traditional animation can still be wonderous. ""The Iron Giant"" among others proved that.<br /><br />Negatives: The visuals	 pace	 and sheer lack of originality.<br /><br />Positives: Quite possibly the coolest death scene for a Disney villain in a long time. It's the creative highlight of the movie."	0.0

Bad Directing 	Bad Characters 	Horrible Acting 	Horrible story There's a reason nobody but Sam ever says anything positive about this film.

"Let me state first that I love Westerns & Civil War stories. I also consider John Ford as an excellent director. I also have the same high feelings for John Wayne & William Holden's acting ability.<br /><br />I cannot remember if I saw this film when it first came out in 1959. Last night was the first time I saw it since then.<br /><br />As per my 4 rating	 one can say I did not like the movie.<br /><br />I now will attempt to tell some of its shortcomings.<br /><br />John Lee Mahin who wrote the screenplay from Harold Sinclair's novel	 was a very gifted writer & wrote many fine scripts	 This script is poorly written & badly researched. They make mention of the awful conditions of the Andersonville prison	 At the time of the movie Andersonville was not in operation. They also use rifles that were not used at the time.<br /><br />John Ford was directing films for over 40 years & won 4 Oscars. He must have been ill during the making of this.His usual style was missing. It could be that this was film in the south & east and not in Monument Valley.<br /><br />He normally had a stock company of players he used in nearly all his film	 MOST were missing this time. This time only minor cowboy stars Hoot Gibson & Ken Curtiss have roles & of course Anna Lee has a small role. There were no other familiar faces except for the 3 stars. (see below) Mr. Fords stock company made most of his films the classics they were; sadly missed here.<br /><br />Now we come to the main stars John Wayne & William Holden. The Duke also must have been ill	he seemed out of place here. This sort of role usually fit his style perfectly	 he was just adequate here. Wiliam Holden did the best he could	 but nowhere as good as he usually was.<br /><br />It was required that there be an actress in this type of movie. Here in her first major role (second film) is Constance Towers	 a very beautiful person	 But not really an actress	 She is still having roles on Television. Let me be kind and say she has had a long career	more based on her looks than acting talent. Also in caas as Ms. Towers servant is Tennis Star Althea Gibson.I am glad she stuck to tennis.<br /><br />The rest of the production credits were far from the usual high standard of other John Ford films There were a few military type songs supposedly done by the marching cavalry	 not good at all. The action scenes were good but come at the end of film.<br /><br />Ratings *1/2* (out of 4) 47 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)"	0.0
"Luckily	 not knowing anything about this movie I was curious enough to tape it from TV. And then the tape ran out just five minutes before the ending!<br /><br />But I'm glad I managed to get most of it because this is a really great spy movie. There are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plots	 but also very chilling and even daring moments. Considering the production year 1969	 the certain slight lesbian overtones must have raised a few eyebrows. Of course now it doesn't surprise anyone and those scenes in fact seem pretty beautifully done. And it's not just because of the two George's actresses.<br /><br />The gas attack seems to hit every viewer very strongly	 no wonder	 And it certainly did hit me. Very effective. Also the viewpoints from the both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more deepness along the usual suspense and action. This is not just a heroic war tale of one victorious side	 but shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad. Well	 being a case of war	 mostly bad.<br /><br />For the fans of composer Ennio Morricone this is also a must. His work is always excellent	 touching but never over the top. And I think I have to try to catch more movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about Fräulein! Let's hope they get this on DVD soon	 so I can have the entire movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with this very little known gem."	1.0
"Italian horror/suspense film about a wealthy English lord who cruises pubs and taverns for girls with red hair just like his recently deceased wife Evelyn. You know he must have really loved his wife	 because he brings them to his home - a huge	 rotting castle - and makes them disrobe and then tortures them	 whips them	 and kills them. The most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that somehow by the film's end	 we see this guy played by Antonio De Teffe as the HERO of the film. Anyway	 soon	 under the advice of his playboy uncle Roberto Maldera	 De Teffe settles down with a girl he meets at his uncle's party. She moves in and strange things begin to happen to De Teffe's fragile state of mind. He begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally	 well	 just look at the title if you are still curious. Also	 family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions. Poor Aunt Agatha(she looks like she might even be younger than De Teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old) meets her fate in a foxy fashion. Another man is injected and then buried alive. And of course	 there is a whole explanation as to why/how Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia does do some things fairly well: the settings in the film are well-suited for this film though trying to make us believe it is England is ludicrous at best. None of the actors look English. Many having dark black hair and Mediterranean complexions and wearing clothes an Englishman wouldn't be caught dead in. The cars drive on their wrong side of the road. But all that notwithstanding	 the crypt scene was effectively shot and I liked the cheesy resolution too. And of course any film with the sultry	 red-headed Erika Blanc is always a plus. There is a streak of sexual perversion; however	 which I found somewhat appalling with the idea that torturing women was quite alright and healthy in order to relieve one of his mental demons. C'mon."	0.0
"This film is really bad	 with a script full of 'memorable' lines and incredibly bad performances. The special effects are also bad (not the worst ones I have seen	 either) and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it.

At least	 I saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with ""impervious"" skin--but here I am perhaps revealing too much of the ""plot."" Furthermore	 as a viewer of many and sundry films (some of which include the occasional kung fu movie)	 I can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable.

"Right from the start you see that ""Anchors Aweigh"" is a great comedy. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make such a funny team! The songs they sing together are pure entertainment. Kathryn Grayson is gorgeous and really sweet. Dean Stockwell is the cutiest child actor I've never seen. If you are fond of piano	 you'll be amazed by José Iturbi. This movie was the first one to combine animation with real actors and it did that wonderfully in an unforgettable dance number. Undoubtedly one of Kelly's funniest movies."	1.0
"It's not like I have overwhelmingly fond memories of Verhoeven's original pants-down shocker - it always struck me as a glossy	 well-made airport-novel-of-a-movie. Thrilling	 sexy trash	 but trash nonetheless. It was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist. After a decade of anti-sex AIDS-induced hysteria	 a film about a wildly-sexual hotbod who thrill-kills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff. Basic Instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy	 so the fact that it's desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sort-of be overlooked. All it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable. That it resoundingly fails on so many levels	 and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved	 is really quite extraordinary to watch. Let's state the obvious for starters - Sharon Stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet Catherine Trammell. What was so photogenic thru Verhoeven's lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gun-for-hire Michael Caton-Jones	 who's flat	 drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot. I like Sharon Stone a lot	 but if the first film launched her career	 BI2 could kill it. She has no chemistry with stuffed-shirt David Morrissey - their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch. His dough-faced mamma's boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering	 orange-skin machismo of Michael Douglas. Supporting turns by David Thewlis and Charlotte Rampling waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and cliché-heavy posturing. And what of the much-touted sexual shenanigans? Poorly-lit	 fleetingly-glimpsed	 as utterly mainstream as an episode of Desperate Housewives - the European sensibilities that Verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed. Don't watch this film for carnal thrills - there are none and what there is is tragic. The film is	 as a whole	 convoluted to the point of utter confusion	 boring and laughable. The last 40 minutes in particular	 where you come to the realisation that the film is	 in fact	 not going to go anywhere of interest at all	 are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure. As a failed sequel	 Basic Instinct 2 will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as Exorcist 2 The Heretic	 Beyond The Poseidon Adventure and XXX2. As a vanity project	 it rivals Battlefield Earth in its misconception. As a multi-million dollar piece of Hollywood film-making	 it's a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst."	0.0
"This is a pleasant film	 even if the premise is silly. It was sort of a guilty pleasure to watch. Meg Ryan seems to be able to pull off roles in this kind of film (another example is Joe vs. the Volcano). That's what makes her a star	 in part. Walter Matthau	 of course	 had that ability	 too	 and he really puts himself into the role	 making an amusing	 good-hearted Einstein. I suppose you could say they're both good at portraying loveable characters	 though loveable in different ways (loveable young women vs. loveable curmudgeon)."	1.0
"I've never actually seen this film but can tell you one thing about its production. While a comedy/oldies radio DJ in 1988	 I got a call from the production company. They asked if I'd write and record a bit they'd drop into the soundtrack as sounds eminating from a TV (the television screen itself would never be shown). I said sure	 wrote a parody of '50s sci-fi monster clichés	 rounded up some sound effects and called in another DJ	 Pam Landry	 to play the female part. As she happened to be on the air at the time	 she put on a long song	 joined me at the mike in the production room and we cut the voicetrack in a single take. Giggling	 she then went back to her show while I mixed in the goofy sound effects. We'd have never done it if we'd known that ""Woodchipper Massacre"" was going to be such a turkey -- but	 then again	 we never got paid for our efforts	 either! -- Gary Theroux"	0.0
"Playwright Sidney Bruhl (a wonderfully over-the-top Michael Caine) would kill for a hit play. Enter young wonder kid (a solid Reeve) who's just written such a play. Weave into this Bruhl's overly hysterical wife (superbly played by Cannon) and a German psychic (a very funny Irene Worth) and you've got yourself a wonderfully funny suspense flick.<br /><br />While not up to ""Sleuth"" standards	 ""Deathtrap"" is none the less a very capable	 twist filled comical suspense ride based on a terrific play by Ira Levin. The performers are obviously having a field day with the material	 with Caine in particular delivering top notch lines with gusto.<br /><br />The film loses a bit of steam midway through and the ending is a lot less satisfying than the hilarious one in the original play but overall ""Deathtrap"" is solid	 well acted and suspenseful fun."	1.0
"Don't waste time reading my review. Go out and see this astonishingly good episode	 which may very well be the best Columbo ever written! Ruth Gordon is perfectly cast as the scheming yet charming mystery writer who murders her son-in-law to avenge his murder of her daughter. Columbo is his usual rumpled	 befuddled and far-cleverer-than-he-seems self	 and this particular installment features fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Ironically	 this was not written by heralded creators Levinson or Link yet is possibly the densest	 most thoroughly original and twist-laden Columbo plot ever. Utterly satisfying in nearly every department and overflowing with droll and witty dialogue and thinking. Truly unexpected and inventive climax tops all. 10/10...seek this one out on Netflix!"	1.0
"This has the logical consistency of marshmallows filled with ketchup	 and the overall aftertaste is just as disgusting. <br /><br />Will be used in the 9th circle of Hell at recreation time.

"As someone who has never condescended Adam Sandler in terms of talent	 as is done to him and many comic actors like him	 I walked in to Reign Over Me expecting a great film	 not simply because of his presence in the movie but because I thought that it looked very good overall. Even someone who already thought that Sandler could deliver an effective dramatic performance is writing here that I was surprised at how fantastic he is in it. He will make you weep	 especially in his purposefully sudden and unexpected monologue. What's amazing about his role is that it's a character it's hard to say we've seen before. We've seen many emotionally scarred characters	 many mentally retarded people	 many loners	 many passionate self-centered artists	 but Sandler's Charlie Fineman is none of these. He may have a taste of each of them in some ways	 but his character is truly unpredictable and completely individual. It's a joy for the audience to be drawn in emotionally by him and be tugged every which way by someone whose problems	 mindset	 and provocations are completely different from most characters like him.<br /><br />Don Cheadle delivers an interesting performance on a completely different level. He is every man. He is the most normal possible person in the world	 so much so that you will hardly find many characters like his either	 or at least any that are played the way he plays Alan Johnson	 whose name is even found on the assembly line. Cheadle is brilliant in that he is funny	 jolting	 smart	 and stupid the way so many normal people are.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is populated by actors and actresses who've hardly done anything in awhile in smaller but quite colorful roles. Jada Pinkett-Smith is the overly refined upper middle class wife	 Donald Sutherland is the impatient but surprising judge	 Robert Klein is Sandler's desensitized father-in-law.<br /><br />Mike Binder's script is quite brilliant because it says something quite profound about the wonders of communication in all of its guises. It's much more subtle than	 say	 Babel	 and has a much more close-to-home ideal.<br /><br />The camera is only interested in the reality of its images as opposed to the mere style. This film struck me as sort of a sendback to the kitchen-sink style of the 1970s. Cinematography was grainy and unfastened	 but that was its charm. It wasn't about attracting us to the camera itself and the gloss that would've diluted its stories with such.<br /><br />The music	 which plays a major role in the film	 and its title	 is very powerful. Near the beginning	 you feel like you're in for another About Schmidt or Little Miss Sunshine sort of soundtrack	 but you soon realize you're in for more than that. In fact	 the film is packed with lots of music that stimulates a lot of the most emotional scenes.<br /><br />Reign Over Me is a major statement not only for society but also for film itself. It goes to show that even the director of Blankman is capable of wonders."	1.0
"Well I'm probably about to be lambasted by everyone on this site	 but The Good Earth is one of the worst structured films I've seen in a long time. We have a 2 and a half hour film that feels like its three and a half because it has two films in one. The first film tells the story of a family that has to move form their home because of drought and famine. They have to travel south to the cities to find food or work of some kind. Conveniently they happen to find a bag of jewels and at the same time they find out that the drought has ended. Yeah OK. With this knowledge they return home with their riches and everything is fine and wonderful again. <br /><br />Well that takes about an hour and a half of film and while its incredibly lifeless at this point it does have a nice arc to it. You would think this would be a fantastic place to end the film. However	 the film then continues on for a whole other hour. And in this remaining time	 its takes a simple story about a family dealing with the hardships of the world and turns it into a sappy melodrama about betrayal and jealousy between lovers. Oh yea and the age old	 money is the root of all evil blah blah blah. Just because you know your making an epic film doesn't mean that your story can go on needlessly for more than it has to. Also the main idea I would gather about this film is that the earth is good to this family and holds them together. Then why do we spend an hour telling a story about a rich man falling in love with another woman	 and why is the final moment of the film dedicated to a wife that our main character hasn't even cared about through most of the film. <br /><br />Oh wait and the film isn't the only thing thats poorly written	 the main characters wife makes absolutely no sense. She complains a lot about how she was a slave and she never wants to have a slave and yadda yadda yadda. Then why at the drop of a hat is she willing to sell her only daughter into slavery. Even if they are starving at the time of this idea	 it still doesn't make sense when 20 minutes later in the film she is complaining about not wanting a slave again. <br /><br />There are other films from the thirties that should be paid attention to. The only thing this one has going for it is the cinematography. The land is shot beautifully	 oh and the sequence with the locusts is quite impressive. Too bad that were in a film that had nothing to say. <br /><br />One last thing. I know that at this point in time Hollywood was focused mostly on stars and they figured that a good actor can portray anything. For most of the film Paul Muni does portray an Asian man to the best of his ability	 but once it hits the half point where the film goes on for no reason he loses it and just becomes regular old Italian Paul	 they even cut his hair so he looks like Tony from Scarface(also a better film than this). Of all the main characters in the film I think maybe three are actually Asian	 the rest are just Americans being silly. Oh and please Ms. Rainer that was a really nice one note performance	 not	 if i could i rip the Oscar out of your hands	 oh i would. <br /><br />The Good Earth is one epic waste of time. If you want something along this vain to watch on nice evening get The Grapes of Wrath	 a film that truly deserves all the praise it gets. Mainly because it wasn't written by a monkey."	0.0
"I'm not sure why Spike Lee made this train wreck of a movie and conned poor Stevie Wonder into eternally pairing his beautiful music with this theatrical mess. I also resent the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal prose of professional Blacks. The abuse of his hold on ethnic movie goers is a shame. Scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes	 play as if some college kid wrote this. I especially detest the ludicrous scene where the two leads are playfully sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up Snipes. The overacting of the leads makes one feel as if Spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about. The final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tack a point in. This movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the F-word in casual conversation. I am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker. I think his union with Scorcesee in Clockers was a wise move. He should stick to making documentaries like the Four Little Colored Girls. Shock movies do not an Oscar make."	0.0
"There was not one original idea in this story. Themes were pulled from various sources; a few being The Ninth Gate	 In the Mouth of Madness (another Carpenter film)	 and The Ring. It even went as far as featuring the same damn glowing circle from The Ring and using it as the film's namesake. The soundtrack by Cody Carpenter was all but lifted from Suspiria. Hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spewing the word HOMAGE around. Yes	 I saw that the theater was playing Argento's Deep Red. Claiming an homage would be a bullshit cop-out. This was bottom-of-the-barrel. Throwing gore and ""disturbing"" imagery into the pot does not make a good horror film. Carpenter used to know that. He should fade into obscurity or acquire a time machine."	0.0
"huge Ramones fan. i do like the ramones	 and i suppose if you hate them	 then	 besides being a avid Bush supporter	 you might not like this classic.<br /><br />it's immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the 80's. infinitely better than the American Pie's that plague us now.<br /><br />There are some other great high school films: Switchblade Sisters	 Fast Times...

"it's movies like these that make you wish that you never picked on the nerd growing up in school. If you liked this movie	 then I would suggest you watch Valentine. I just found out today that the guy who played Marty(Simon) killed himself a little after the movie was released which is a shame since he did a good job. I wonder if it's because of the part he played in the movie. It starts out when Carol tricks him into going into the girls restroom to act like they were about to do it. When he was changing in the showers	 Carols popular friends snuck into the bathroom and got everything ready	 camera	 electric shock	 pole. When Marty open the curtain butt naked he realized that he was tricked. He tries to cover the shower up but the kids open it	 grab Marty and starts being mean to him while the camera is rolling. They picked him up	 dunked his head in the toliet while it was being flushed	 and they electricuted him(slightly). When the kids are in detention	 given by the coach	 2 of the boys give Marty a joint that will make him throw up. Skip breaks one of the glass windows in the gym using a brick to get the teacher to excuse him. While Marty is puking in the bathroom Skip sneaks into the Science Lab and mixes some stuff that looks like cocaine but not sure what it was. The lab blows up disfiguring him badly. 5 years later the kids who tormented him that day got invitations for a 5 year school reunion at the old school which was burn that day it exploded. One by one the people get killed off. I don't understand how the girl who drowned really drowned. she could have gotten back up after Marty left. She almost got out the first time."	1.0
"The first episode of this new show was on today	 and it was horrible. Not only did Shaggy have a squeaky new voice that made listening to his lines torture	 but it's so far away from the original concept and animation style that it's barely recognizable as a 'Scooby-Doo' show.<br /><br />Even back in the dark days when Fred and Velma were gone and Scooby's nephew Scrappy was there	 the team still solved mysteries. This new show instead features Shaggy and Scooby battling a James Bond type super-villain and his henchmen while living in a mansion. There's not even a van called 'The Mystery Machine' (and the teaser for the next episode which promised a transformers type robot car did NOT put my mind at ease). How can anyone take Scooby Doo and make THIS? <br /><br />The show earns two point for two scenes featuring the whole Scooby Doo gang	 all of whom speak with the correct voices except Shaggy	 and even then I'm being far too generous."	0.0
"This is the greatest film I saw in 2002	 whereas I'm used to mainstream movies. It is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act from these 11 short films. From the technical info (the chosen directors)	 I feared it would have an anti-American basis	 but ... it's a kind of (11 times) personal tribute.<br /><br />The weakest point comes from Y. Chahine : he does not manage to ""swallow his pride"" and considers this event as a well-merited punishment ... It is really the weakest part of the movie	 but this testifies of a real freedom of speech for the whole piece. The weirdest comes from the Mexican nearly conceptual-art film ... I am still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu meant. The 9 others are perfect (K. Loach	 S. Penn	 S. Makhmalbaf	 ...) or nearly perfect (C. Lelouch) and made me either smile	 or cry or even left me stunned. I still don't know if S. Imamura's fable is really related or not to the September 11th catastrophe	 but it is so pretty that its finale place deeply 'makes it'."	1.0
"Othello	 the classic Shakespearen story of love	 betrayal	 lies	 and tragedy. I remember studying this story in high school	 actually I found Othello to be probably my favorite Shakespeare story due to the fact of how fascinating it was	 the fact that Shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship	 love	 and racism perfectly. I mean	 when you really do study this story	 you could go into so many philosophies on why Othello went insane with jealousy in the blink of an eye. But later on for my report I also watched this version of Othello and I have to say that it was absolutely brilliant. Lawerance and Kenneth just capture the story so well and understood it's darkness.<br /><br />Othello is the big time soldier in his city	 he is loved by everyone	 including the king. But when the king finds out that Othello snuck off with his daughter	 Desdemona	 the king is infuriated	 but excepts it. Othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend	 Cassio	 his side man instead of Iago	 who has stood by Othello. Due to his insane jealousy	 he's out for revenge. Still pretending to be Othello's best friend	 he just mearly hints at Othello that Desdemona is cheating on him with Cassio	 never says that they are	 just makes Othello think that it's happening. Othello is driven insane and doesn't have pleasant plans for Desdemona or Cassio and Iago is more than happy to help him out.<br /><br />Othello is an incredible story	 I highly recommend that you read it. It's an incredible story that keeps you thinking after you've read it. Othello the movie is also great and once again I recommend it	 it captured the story perfectly and has a big tearjerker type of feel	 or you could just be in utter shock of what happens between Othello and Desdemona	 how quickly he believes that his true love would betray him. This is a terrific movie	 great acting	 good sets	 and good direction	 this is what Shakespeare meant when he wrote the story.<br /><br />10/10"	1.0
"I've seen enough of both Little Richard in interviews and in performances and enough of poor Leon pigeonholed into these 50s/60s musical bio pics to know that Leon was not the right actor for this role. Leon was so right as David Ruffin in The Temptations	 but fails utterly to capture the essence of Little Richard in this film. <br /><br />Actor Miguel Núñez who played Little Richard in ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love?"" was a much more suitable choice	 having pulled off the musician's powerful but effeminate persona. <br /><br />If the performances are unconvincing then the film will be as well. And this is what has happened here. Glossed over or missed entirely are LR's forays into homosexuality and voyeurism. What ""The Temptations"" did so well in capturing the rise of the group	 warts and all	 this film misses by a wide mark.<br /><br />What is going on with director Robert Townsend who started off so well with ""The Hollywood Shuffle""? He's a talented	 funny guy but hasn't delivered anything near that first effort."	0.0
"I caught this movie on FX last night	 and as I was sitting there watching it	 it occurred to me that it could quite possibly be the worst movie ever. Bad acting	 bad cinematography	 bad sound	 totally unbelievable fight sequences	 stupid characters. All these made it up to be the most laughably bad movie I've ever seen. It was so bad	 I was enthralled by it's sheer lack of anything semi-competent that I had to keep watching... and they made a sequel!"	0.0
"An excellent cast makes this movie work; all of the characters are developed exceedingly well and it's clear that the actors enjoyed filming this movie.<br /><br />It's not quite the comedy I expected	 much more a lighthearted look at the attempt to reclaim youthful glory than bawdy humor. For music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funny.<br /><br />I hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies	 but so much of this movie reminded me of Alan Parker films I can't help it: imagine if The Commitments actually did make it big -- and then tried to recapture said glory 25 years later."	1.0
"Just got my copy of this DVD two disc set and while not perfect	 I found the overall experience to be a fun way to waste some time. I have to say right up front that I am a huge fan of Zombie movies	 and I truly think that the fine people who made these films must be too. I also have a soft spot for people who are trying	 sometimes against all odds	 to live a dream. And again	 these people are doing it. Is this some award-winning collection of amazing film? No. Not even close. But for what they do on their meager budgets	 these films should be recommended. For me	 the bottom line is always	 was I entertained? Did I have a good time with this movie? And here the answer to both was ""Yes."" The first in the series is also the most raw. It opens with some kind of accident at a nuclear facility and people melt down or something. Cut to some years later and a new housing community is built over the old reactor site. Some kids making a video fall into a hole and find themselves trapped in the bottom levels of the facility. They get rescued	 but the hole is not sealed and the people from the opening start lumbering out of the hole. Soon	 the whole town is overtaken by the undead. And these zombies are fun. They go from cool rot makeup to the cheapest slap on white-face ever	 but they are fun. The whole movie culminates in a showdown between the final survivors of the area and the undead	 with our heroes going into the reactor's lower levels to take out the flesh eating zombies and seal the hole forever! Pretty cheesy	 but I think it was meant to be. Still	 it moves very fast	 has buckets of gruesome effects and really tries to have some style. The acting is uneven	 but a few good performances shine through and one really should listen to the commentary track. I went back and watched it again with that on and found it to be a good bit of information on the trials and fun that the crew and cast experienced on the movie. Director Todd Sheets seems pretty proud of this	 his first film	 but also has no delusions. He knows it's a trashy zombie movie	 but he does show respect to people involved. Also	 Sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field. The behind the scenes of Zombie Bloodbath is pretty fun as well. I felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for. There are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage	 mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like CNN	 FOX and MTV. Over all	 a fun little film that is VERY rough around the edges	 but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride! I have seen many DV films	 and some shot of video films	 and many are quite dull	 but this one really wasn't. While newer DV films are technically superior	 they just aren't fun! Overall	 this is a solid	 if a bit flawed	 release with plenty of extras and TONS of gore and splatter. While not breaking any grand rules of move making	 I found the series to be fun and always a laugh	 so I give this set a solid recommendation. Todd Sheets was not trying to make award winning art here folks	 he was trying	 sometimes against all odds it seems	 to make fun zero budget	 splattery horror and to that end	 he has succeeded in spades."	1.0
"'1408' is the latest hodge podge of cheap scare tactics. The kind that might make date-movie styled horror fans occasionally jump in their seat and scream in your ear	 but disappoint audiences searching for a little depth and direction.<br /><br />John Cusak plays a writer who's made a career of writing books describing his experiences of staying in rumored haunted hotels. Despite assurances by patrons and owners that ghosts roam the halls	 there is little to make him a real believer in the paranormal. When he learns of the history of Room 1408 at the Overlook Hotel--no wait	 I mean	 Dolphin Hotel in New York City--he decides it would make the perfect closing chapter to his latest book. But	 Samuel L. Jackson	 playing the hotel owner	 strongly attempts to dissuade his guest with narration of the atrocities that have occurred in theat room since the hotel's opening many years ago. The story is simple and we	 as possible skeptics	 must sit through Jackson's lengthy foreshadowing ramble. <br /><br />In other words: be afraid! Be very afraid!<br /><br />Of course	 it would be easy to convince audiences that they've just paid to see an edge-of-the-seat thriller if it didn't take so long to build up to this point. And also	 if what followed was a lot more than cheap ""boos"" that become so frequent and arbitrary that eventually	 you might soon expect them. The temperature in the room changes automatically. The walls drip with blood. The fearless writer can't open the door	 etc. And after nearly an hour and a half of delivering these to audiences promised big thrills	 you might sit and hope that at least you can be wowed by the ending. With suspicions of dream sequences and other derivative time-wasters	 even that fails to quell our doubts that before the movie is over	 we might finally have something to make the movie a little less than completely forgettable.<br /><br />Despite grand performances (as always) by Cusak	 who essentially is the entire film	 most everyone else of note is wasted (i.e. Samuel L. Jackson) in insignificant minor roles. The true mystery here is how this movie received such a high viewer rating. Ballot-stuffing ghosts?"	0.0

"This film is one of the best of all time	 certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding	 the music is just as good as the film and the killer is as creepy as can be! Actors are fantastic	 RIP Donald Pleasance you were fantastic as Dr Loomis	 he made the film even better. Without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also superb as our beloved scream queen! Her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house	 which of course is one of the films best scenes. She gives a tremendous performance. I loved this film since it scared me like hell back when I seen it in the very early 80's and I still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be gutted like a fish at every turn! The fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that he is there	 is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true. We all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon	 a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this. Death at any turn. Halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way. Horror should be believable	 and that is what makes the film enjoyable. It's just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. As well as Psycho's superb storyline	 both of which I adore	 I believe there formats are the best horror has to offer. To me Halloween and Psycho are the best films I have ever seen and I will watch them all my life and never grow tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time."	1.0
"Absence of a GOOD PLOT	 absence of decent ACTING	 absence of good CINEMATOGRAPHY	 absence of decent looking SPECIAL EFFECTS...need I go on? Review MAY contain SPOILERS.

The story appeared to have been written by one of the aforementioned second graders...it's not really all that convoluted...it's just so SIMPLE and DUMB	 that a person thinks they must be missing something so they think it is convoluted. Nope it's not	 it's EXACTLY as SIMPLE as you think it is. I UNDERSTOOD the ""film""	 that's how i KNOW that it STUNK! MOST of the film just had people sitting around talking(reading their lines)	 TRYING to look sinister. The narrator was ANNOYING. The ""special effects"" were LAUGHABLE. I love low budget movies. I also like Carolyn Munro	 Tom Savini	 Jack Scarry	 and Michael Berrymore...just not in THIS movie...you can tell they weren't getting paid	 or weren't getting paid much	 because neither their hearts NOR their talents were in it. I LOVE Tony Todd...however	 he was only adequate in this movie. In fact	 Tony Todd's performance is the ONLY reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1...and Tony was only in it for a whole TWO MINUTES (seriously)! I would suggest to fast forward the DVD to the two minute Tony Todd segment. If I had gone to the theater	 and paid more than a DOLLAR to see this ""film"" I would have been P.O.'D and demanded my money back. Hopefully the people who made this will do better next time."	0.0
"I see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in August	 though the movie was not released in the US	 at least	 until the middle of September. Maybe these are unhappy expats living in S.

The story was non-Western	 but I think we are all used to this from many other movies. It wasn't at all hard to follow. The acting by the leads was weak	 but other people were quite good.

"There are some elements that save this movie from being a total catastrophe	 but are overshadowed with bad acting	 plot holes	 deus ex machina thrown ins	 stupid dialogs	 weak script	 and predictable clichés...<br /><br />What we have here is a horror movie with a storyline that goes nowhere for most of the time. A group of unlikely heroes including a black guy that gets it first (yeah	 that cliché seems to be still very much alive even in Finland)	 seem to have trouble trying to exit a mysteriously empty hospital. There are shrieking ghosts (very imaginative)	 zombies (at one point I thought at least they didn't use zombies	 but they came)	 and Finnish glam-rock band with demonic make-up on	 getting in their way. There is also some time-shift doodle present	 but it adds up nothing to the storyline. Autistic girl and a hobo seem to have some deeper understanding of a situation	 but they never spell it out to the viewer	 or their confused friends. Their lines consist only of profound life lesson thoughts like: ""What happens will happen..."" or ""Light can't live in the darkness..."" or the ominous ""I need a red crayon... red crayon."" So all this characters (including worried father and sweet doctor in distress types) end up doing is running around them dark floors	 and from or mistakenly to the demons. Occasionally a ghost or a group of zombies show up	 and if it seems a demon keyboardist can't spot a group of six people coming towards it	 waving a flashlight and conversing	 it was just pretending. And apparently this demon can break through walls without much hassle	 but opening elevator door is beyond its capabilities.<br /><br />In the end we even get a ""it was all a dream"" sequence twist.

"DER TODESKING is not one of my favorite Jorg Buttgereit film - but still is an interesting film dealing with suicide and it's reasons and ramifications. Those looking for a gore-fest	 or exploitation in the style of the NEKROMANTIK films or SCHRAMM will probably be disappointed. DER TODESKING is definitely an ""art-house"" style film	 so those that need linear	 explainable narratives need not apply...<br /><br />The basic concept of DER TODESKING is that there is an ""episode"" for each day of the week that revolves around a strange chain letter that apparently causes people to commit suicide	 interspersed with scenes of a slowly decomposing corpse...<br /><br />There are some very well done and thought provoking scenes	 including the man talking about the ""problems"" with his wife	 and the concert massacre (which unfortunately lost some of it's ""power"" on me	 because I was too busy laughing at the SCORPIONS look-alike band on stage...). But seriously - this is a sometimes beautiful (the scene that shows different angles of that huge bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the significance of the scene	 and that the names shown are of people that actually committed suicide from jumping from the bridge...)	 sometimes confusing	 sometimes silly (the SHE WOLF OF THE SS rip-off is pretty amusing)	 sometimes harrowing (I found the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park about his wife particularly effective) film that is more of an ""experience"" then just entertainment	 as many of these ""art"" films are meant to be. Still	 I didn't find DER TODESKING to be as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM	 and would probably put it on relatively even footing with NEKROMANTIK 2 in terms of my personally ""enjoyment level"". Definitely worth a look to any Buttgereit or ""art"" film fan. If you dig this type of film - check out SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - in my opinion the BEST art-house/horror film that I've seen. 7/10 for DER TODESKING"	1.0
"""A Christmas Story"" is one of many people's all-time most beloved films. ACS was able to take the viewer to a time and a place in such a way that very few films ever have. It had a sweetness and goodwill to it that is rare.<br /><br />So I awaited (and awaited) its sequel	 ""It Runs In The Family"" . The film was almost released a couple of times	 only to be pulled at the last minute. When it finally came out	 IRITF was (and is	 I guess) a total failure.<br /><br />The sets and cinematography were just fine	 but the directing totally	 completely missed the mark. The film was nothing more than a cash-flow formula of lazy casting	 lazy writing	 and disconnected acting.<br /><br />The narrator	 Jean Shepard	 who was one of America's great humorists and story-tellers	 forced upon us a false reprise of the warm wit he used in ACS. He over-emoted	 and why he did that I'll never know. He somehow managed to become an annoying	 overwrought parody of himself.<br /><br />The writing and acting in IRITF is inauthentic and forced. The actors may have seen ACS	 but whatever wit and nuance that was in ACS mustn't have registered at all on any of them. The acting was embarrassingly slapstick and bereft of any of Shepard's dry humor.<br /><br />ACS will always be a real treasure	 but to call IRITF a sequel is to insult all of the fans of Jean Shepard and ACS."	0.0
"This is quite the gripping	 fascinating	 tragic story. Quite good	 and for the most part pretty accurate	 considering it IS a TV movie rather than a documentary. They did create some fictional characters	 and combine several actual people into one character	 but otherwise this is a good telling of a very tragic and dark story.<br /><br />The final moments of the movie	 depicting the mass suicide/murder	 are almost directly taken from an audio recording made by Jim Jones. This recording was made during the final 44 minutes of the Peoples Temple's existence. It is available in several places on the internet.

"A little girl lives with her father and brother in the middle of the countryside. This little girl Rosalie has some psychotic tendencies as the movie opens with her feeding kittens to some kind of creatures in the cemetery	 and she has recently lost her mother who went crazy but whilst alive enjoyed staying in the woods all night. The premise of the film has a new young lady coming to Rosalie to take care of her. She is introduced to the evil of the woods while driving and	 imagine the suspense here	 experiences a huge blue barrel falling over the side of a cliff to somehow stop her car dead in its tracks. From there she walks to the nearest house and discovers Mrs. Whitfield who then goes into a whole lot of explanation about Rosalie and her family. The earnestness exuded by the Mrs. Whitfield character has to be seen to be believed. Well	 the young lady meets up with the child and we soon learn that not only is she strange but everyone in the film is very bizarre as well. They all do share one thing in common which is none of them ever heard of an acting school. None of these people can act - as evidenced by the few vehicles any of them in the entire film appeared in before or since - and all of them look like they have little idea what is going on	 pause to remember lines	 and have all the conviction of a paper bag. The director plods through the material in a slow pace with this horrible piano music crescendoing here and there at things that are suppose to be scary. It takes us a bit before we get to a couple of murders by the creature friends	 but by that time I didn't care. The murders are not convincing either	 and truth be told the whole film looks like someone through it together on their friend's farm with the people and things on hand there. That all being said the ending does have some creepy aspects to it though we don't learn one darn thing about why Rosalie is like this or more importantly who the creature with the cheap masks are. Cheap doesn't even begin to describe the budget here with. It basically is a couple old farmhouses and some sheds at the end and of course the woods. Someone lent the director a couple old cars too. No special effects of any kind and only the most minimal make-up. There are so many guffaws/ridiculous moments to list	 but I will just list a few here that at the very least made me chuckle from the lack of aptitude from the creative powers involved: 1)Watch the gardener's body well after he has been ""slain"". Len comes in and sees him butchered and you can see his fat belly heave with life. 2)the dying scene at the end where the actress playing Rosalie is killed. She looks like she is listening to directions and takes her sweet time dying considering the method. 3)How about the guy playing Roaslie's father giving us a cranky poor man's Andy Griffith. The scene where he is laughing about boy scouts dying was a weird hoot. The Child is indeed a very bad film and is very bad even for the standards of 70's cheese if you will. This isn't a B film but more like a Z film with producer Harry Novak making some money on virtually nothing."	0.0
"I loved this movie. I totally disagree with some (negative) critiques that I've read over the years. This was a great vehicle for Eddie Murphy! He appeared to have a great time with his part as Chandler Jarrell and he should never care about what the critics say	 if he had fun doing it  and most of his audience enjoyed it! And	 it WAS fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with Mr. Murphy's great comedic style. You have to keep in mind that 'Golden Child' is a 'fantasy' film  just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the 'real' world. During the time this film was released	 I was working in a video rental store. This was one of the most popular with all our customers. Every single time	 we put this one up on our monitor	 ALL the copies we had went out fast with wait-list requests that kept it on the queue for months! Everyone who rented it loved it! I was the resident film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented  this was one of my favorites and I knew the taste of my customers so I highly recommended this one to most of them. I really feel that this film is a Sleeper  it may not have done too well at the box office  due to very poor marketing  but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later! (YES	 I did buy this film for my own video library!). I adored the little boy who played the 'Golden Child'  J. L. Reate - but after looking at his profile in IMDb	 I noticed that he never did any more films. That is sad	 because he definitely had an on-screen aura and could have continued with a film career. I also adored Victor Wong	 who played the Old Man (I LOVED him in his part as 'Egg Shen' in 'Big Trouble in Little China' - 1986). At any rate	 this was a great film. The only drawbacks that didn't seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more 'adult' in nature  such as 'Chandler's rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette. It was funny	 but it still was out of sync. OK	 so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes  those were put in for the mind-set of the day perhaps. This was still an adventurous and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from Hollywood. Now that's Entertainment!"	1.0
"...Ok I have read about this film somewhere in the internet	 and many criticized on how bad and sucks this film was. And I couldn't have been more agree about it. Then after that I saw this film on DVD	 I was thinking twice about this and then came commercial of this film on TV. Luckily I spared my money for this pieces of crap. I was sacrificed my sleeps for this film and soon it turned out that this film couldn't make me satisfy. So I can't be judging on how the film was made	 but anyway... it still sucks. As for those who liked this film	 I would apologize for flaming this film and telling on how sucks this film is. I don't know what do YOU think about this film?"	0.0
"The fourth in the ""Dirty Harry"" series	 this film features one of the most despicable	 ugliest	 unlikable	 profane	 disgusting females I have ever seen on film: ""Ray Perkins	"" played by Audrie Neenan. She is the modern nasty low-life version of the 1945 ""Detour"" character	 ""Ann Savage.""<br /><br />Her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much I never watched this film again until I acquired a profanity filter which shut her up....and least some of her! Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Everywhere ""Harry Callahan"" (Clint Eastwood) goes	 violence immediately follows.....within minutes! It happens so often it's almost laughable but it makes for a fast-moving	 entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated one-by-one.<br /><br />This is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base instincts.....and connects	 sad to say. Most of us like to see these dirtballs get it in the end	 and who does it better than Dirty Harry?"	1.0
I have seen this movie when I was about 7 years old - which was 33 years ago - and I never forgot this movie! I was deeply touched and moved by the brave little boy and the beautiful eagle. And I just couldn't believe it when he turned into an eagle just when everyone in the theater thought he was going to die...<br /><br />My sister was in the movie with me and I asked her recently if she remembered the movie we saw with the boy and the eagle and she said she remembered it like we saw it only yesterday. So it isn't just me.<br /><br />This movie is a MUST SEE !!!<br /><br />You will never forget it - just like my sister and me...	1.0
"Your first clue that this is a cheesy movie is that it was shot on video	 not film. The story is convoluted	 and the production is amazingly sloppy. Note	 for example	 that when the title couple are on a plane ostensibly landing in Vermont	 where they've gone to celebrate their relationship in a civil union ceremony	 the plane is shown coming into an airport surrounded by palm trees. Their ceremony - in Vermont - takes place in a garden of tropical plants	 including palms	 which wouldn't last five minutes in the New England climate. On yet another airplane trip	 the establishing shot depicts a FedEx cargo plane taking off. Presumably they could only afford to travel in steerage. As for the plot	 this movie expects you to believe that Victor	 the devoutly Christian brother of Arthur	 is kicked out of his church when the congregation learns that his BROTHER is gay. Not only that	 but the pastor eventually sets Victor up with a hit man to have Ben and Arthur killed ""to purge their souls of sin."" Apparently no one in this church has ever heard of the Ten Commandments. Were it not for Jamie Brett Gabel	 who is surprisingly effective as Arthur	 this movie would have no redeeming qualities at all."	0.0
"Ahh this film had so much potential! A good cast of quality B actors	 the thighs of Jessica Simpson and... that is about it!<br /><br />I believe some guy in some unnamed marketing department had an idea. Basically	 lets do a kind of Legally Blond film	 but do it in New York. That big bright city of chances	 power and money and where everyone is a heartless	 power/money hungry person. Let's add to this Jessica Simpson	 small town bimbo	 that brother of Owen Wilson and for some no apparent reason Andy Dick (only because of him you should ignore this film).<br /><br />Basic story line:<br /><br />Boy leaves girl for NY	 girl follows	 boy cheats	 girl stays in NY with cousin	 gets a job under false pretenses	 mucks up	 is courted by other boy (Brother Wilson) and together save the day and kiss.<br /><br />a few words come to mind when reflecting upon this film	 i.e. dire	 awful	 unbearable	 intolerable and xenophobic<br /><br />Just don't watch this film	 you will be happier. One reviewer referred to Guantanamo and i definitely agree with him. This film induces shock. And I know what you are thinking... at least at some point will I see Simpson naked or close too. It's not gonna happen	 spare yourself the time and YouTube her. You will have better sexy time!<br /><br />The films editing is flimsy	 the acting is unbearable	 and why do they use blue screens?<br /><br />In conclusion; this is cinematic treason which should be punished to the maximum<br /><br />Another question why does Willie Nelson always play a kind of father figure in almost every Jessica Simpson flick and why are there no black	 Latin	 Asian or European people in this movie?"	0.0
"The characters were alive and interesting	 the plot was excellently paced	 the pyro effects were masterfully accomplished	 and it takes a basic love triangle story and tosses in a science-fiction element into it. I could identify with many of the characters and their motivations made logical rational sense in the framework of the story.<br /><br />The camera-work was great	 the audio clear and accurate	 the background music perfectly chosen for effect	 the singing firemen a nice talented memorable oddity	 the sets brilliantly crafted	 and the special effects performed with a skilled talent.<br /><br />I am a tad puzzled how an entire mini-carnival in a chain-store's parking lot could be powered by one single lamppost outlet. That seems impossible to say the least. The fight between the brothers near the end of the movie was brilliant though. Having Jim Varney in a non-clown role was a wonderful touch too as played the semi-serious role of a carny very well."	1.0
"I disliked Frosty returns and this one. Both of the films are absurd with poorly written characters and bad voices. The voices could have been done but Frosty returns was worst than this because of the unalike snowman they drew. Frosty's winterwonder land was great and so was the original heartwarming Drama. The only good thing about this film was Frosty the snowman was alike of the classic 60s and a funny line like when they were talking about things that are not real and then Frosty walks by the window humming	 whistling whatever he was doing but everything else was badly written and badly animated and I barely got the plot. I saw the DVD cover at the library about 2 or 3 years ago and the art looked crappy so I didn't pick it up until this year because the pictures on the back looked a little touching but I played this film. It was a hassle poorly art characters just like the DVD and it was just terrible about what's going on. I watched this at night and found it dull that I fell asleep on the whole thing (Wait I always do that when I watch something while I go to sleep) But this movie was overall boring<br /><br />Overall rating: Grade -C<br /><br />This is like another holiday special bad rip-off in the frosty returns and this one. This one is the badly 4th sequel like Home alone 4 well i thought that movie was OK but home alone 3 was great. But it's like a bad home alone 3 and 4 people hate like this. My sister didn't watch it that much because when she came into my room to watch 2 minutes and a half of it	 she walked away like ""I hate the animation!"" I agree to her just like the 3rd one Frosty returns. Plain awful!"	0.0
"I LOVE this movie. Director Michael Powell once stated that this was his favorite movie	 and it is mine as well. Powell and Pressburger created a seemingly simple	 superbly crafted story - the power of love against ""the powers that be"". However	 its deception lies in the complexity of its ""is it real or is it imaginary"" premise. Basically	 one could argue that it is simply a depiction of the effects of war on a young	 poetically inclined airman during WWII. Or is it? The question is never answered one way or the other. Actually	 it is never even asked. This continuous understatement is part of the film's appeal.<br /><br />The innovative photography and cinematography even includes some nice touches portraying the interests of the filmmakers. For instance	 Pressburger always wanted to do a cinematic version of Richard Strauss' opera	 Der Rosenkavalier	 about a young 18th century Viennese aristocrat. This is evident in the brief interlude in which Conductor 71	 dressed in all his finery	 holds the rose (which appears silver in heaven). The music even has a dreamy quality.<br /><br />All of the acting is first rate - David Niven is at his most charming	 and he has excellent support from veteran Roger Livesey and relative newcomer Kim Hunter. But	 in my opinion	 the film's charm comes from Marius Goring as Conductor 71. He by far has the most interesting role	 filling each of his scenes with his innocent lightheartedness	 brightening the film. It's a pity that some of Conductor 71's scenes were left on the cutting room floor. It is also a pity that Goring's comedic talents are rarely seen again on film	 except in the wonderful videos of The Scarlet Pimpernel television series from the 1950s. This is by far and away the most memorable role of his film career. He is a perfect foil for relaxed style of Niven	 and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters. Ironically	 also in the mid -1940s	 Niven also starred against another heavenly ""messenger""	 played by Cary Grant	 in The Bishop's Wife. Their acting styles were so similar that I found the result boring	 unenergetic	 and disappointing. As a note	 according to Powell	 Goring desperately wanted the role of Peter Carter	 initially refusing Conductor 71. It's a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayal.<br /><br />The movie	 ""commissioned"" to smooth over the strained relations between Britain and the U.S.	 overdrives its point towards the end. But it is disarming in its gentle reminders of the horrors of war - the numerous casualties	 both military and civilian	 the need to ""go on"" when faced with death. There is a conspicuous lack of WWII ""enemies"" in heaven	 but the civilians shown are of indeterminate origin. Powell and Pressburger could have been more explicit in their depiction but it wasn't necessary. The movie may not have served its diplomatic purpose as was hoped for	 but its originality continues to inspire moviemakers and viewers alike on both sides of the Atlantic."	1.0
"Now let me tell you about this movie	 this movie is MY FAVORITE MOVIE!!! This movie has excellent combat fighting.

I rate this movie 10/10."	1.0
"First off	 this is no where near as bad as some of the other trash the Sci-Fi Channel has produced; that isn't to say that Grendel is a good film	 in fact	 it is very bad	 but it definitely had potential to be a lot better. The flaws of the film come from character design	 character	 absurd additions to the story	 the visual effects	 the music	 and for the most part: the acting.<br /><br />When speaking of character design	 I	 of course	 mean the way our heroes and villains look. Beowulf and the other Danes seem like ridiculous Vikings	 rather than warriors of brute strength -- that helmet our main protagonist wears is just too silly. Grendel looks like the Hulk but with strange tentacle-attachments to his elbows.<br /><br />The characters are very limited. Beowulf is same from beginning to end	 however Finn -- a useless sidekick -- achieved some two-dimensionality	 due thanks to his romantic subplot	 and Unferth gets some notion as well	 as he becomes less conceited.<br /><br />Much like Finn	 there are useless additions to this story to make it its own	 while still holding to the source material. The crossbow that is gifted to Beowulf is so ridiculous	 I'm surprised the cast didn't walk off the set. Besides additions	 there's omissions	 such as the underlying themes of Christianity and Paganism	 as well as the consequences of lying.<br /><br />The special effects are mighty terrible. Grendel and his mother Hag are poorly conceived	 and as such	 they're portrayal on screen is less than believable.<br /><br />The music is overbearing	 especially when a character dies.<br /><br />All in all	 this is not Sci-Fi's worst film to date. No. It is actually one of the better films	 though trash it still it is	 it is good trash	 making it a guilty pleasure at best. The only thing that works is the dialogue	 which is still wooden here and there.<br /><br />I highly recommend you skip this film and watch Robert Zemeckis' take on the ancient story of Beowulf	 simply because this film (Grendel) is only half the tale	 and not the whole thing	 which garners this movie a three-star review."	0.0
"""The Case of the Scorpion's Tail"" has all the elements that are necessary in order to make an effective giallo movie. The story is standard giallo. When a man dies in a plane crash his wife (Ida Galli) collects a $1 million life insurance policy. The widow heads to Greece for the payout but a series of gruesome murders follow her. There are plenty of suspects	 including a tenacious investigator (George Hilton) from the insurance agency and the widow's lover. Director Martino keeps the story moving at a fast pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer. Anita Strindberg (also memorable in ""Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key"" and ""Who Saw Her Die?"") is a stunning-looking heroine. It's one of Martino's best films."	1.0
"One of the most timely and engrossing documentaries	 you'll ever watch. While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas	 it provides an intimate look into political dynamics	 that prevail throughout the western Hemisphere. While essentially another chapter in the story of the ""U.S. backed	 Latin American coup""	 this film chronicles in real-time	 what can happen when the poorest people	 are armed with unity	 political savvy	 and courage! <br /><br />The political insights offered by this film are invaluable. One gets clear examples of the private media	 as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda. We see the poor people of Caracas grappling with the brutal realities of ""American politics"". One gets a clear sense of impending doom	 if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny	 which has been abruptly	 and illegally	 thrust upon them by the conspirators. We also see the arrogance and fascism	 of the CIA backed	 private media	 plutocrats	 and generals	 who've conspired to bring Venezuela back under Washington's domination. Though ably led by President Hugo Chavez	 the people of Caracas are forced to act without him	 after Chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals. Their response is the highpoint of the film. If one seeks an excellent portrait of what the U.S. government	 Hugo Chavez	 and revolutionary Venezuela	 are all about	 this movie is it!"	1.0
"How many more of those fake ""slice of life"" movies need to be made? Hopefully not too many.<br /><br />Raising Victor Vargas is a very self-conscious attempt by the director Peter Solett at garnering the attention of Hollywood. Nothing wrong with that in general. What is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every cliché in the book of supposedly ""edgy"" Hollywood independent production.<br /><br />It's supposed to be ""real"" so left shake the camera ""documentary style""	 except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose...<br /><br />It's ""edgy"" so let's not waste any time lighting the film.<br /><br />It's ""hip""	 so let's have the children use swear words like Al Pacino in Scarface...<br /><br />And so on	 and so forth. All that you are left with is a very self-conscious attempt at impressing Hollywood that won't impress anyone outside of the ""rarefied"" indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film."	0.0
"Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 films	 for there is not much of a plot 	 bad acting	 pretty tedious and some really cheesy jokes. But. And this is a big but	 there is one good actor	 one good recurring joke	 and a good beginning. The good actor being Tim Curry	 the one good recurring joke is the creepy	weird butler with the disgusting hand who always does cringey but laugh worthy things. And the good beginning is the spoof of the Excorsist.<br /><br />The plot to Scary Movie 2 is the main characters from the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay the night at a creepy old mansion	 but will they survive the night?

"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Long time inmate Twitch (Kurupt) gets himself transfered to a tougher prison than the re-opened Alcatraz. He claims it's to be closer to his lady but his real motives are a bit more grandiose. There he crosses paths with Burke (Bill Goldberg) a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself. Twitch	 despite being less muscular	 is just as mouthy and is pretty much the same. But there is a gang war brewing between the black and hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the black's gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at Burke. But the sh!t really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the hispanics	 Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter hostage.<br /><br />Steven Seagal doesn't do sequels (reportedly very opposed to the idea of Under Siege 2 and only agreeing to do it on the condition the film company he was with at the time let direct his own movie) so despite this being a DVD sequel	 the lead role this time round goes to Bill Golberg (Steve doesn't even appear in some of the stock footage from the first film that appears towards the end.) But there's a reason he hasn't done much work since Universal Soldier 2 and that's because he's not much of an actor	 and not much of an action star either	 managing a character that begins as very dark and brooding but unsubtly turns into a standard action hero awkwardly quipping off dull one-liners. Support wise	 veterans from the first film	 Kurupt and Tony Plana	 have merely jumped at the chance of extra work.<br /><br />This is a film that's tried to copy the style of the original quite well	 with the dim lighting	 dark shadows and rap music playing over a lot of it. It does this quite well	 unfortunately it can't contend with an unengaging hero	 an equally cardboard villain and an apathetic story that the makers do very much seem to have made up as they went along. **"	0.0
"Kudos to director and cast for such a realistic film. The grittiness	 lack of glamor and desperation drew me into the film and kept me there.

Personally	 I thought all the principles did a tremendous job...it was great to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such difficult roles. It made me want to cry at times.

"Nick Millard aka Nick Phillips should have left well-enough alone when he made ""Criminally Insane"" 10 years before the release of this god-awful waste of time and effort. The fact that the original ""Criminally Insane"" was less than an hour in length should have clued him into the fact that he had probably milked this storyline for all he was going to get out of it...but instead he opts to use TONS of footage from the original in this one as well	 even to the point of recycling the original opening credit sequence! Unfortunately	 bringing back the rapidly aging Priscilla Alden did not save this one. What little bit of original footage there was in this flick looks as if it were filmed with a rented hand-held camcorder! If this film cost more than $100 to make I would be very surprised and I would be equally surprised if it made anything close to that amount! Avoid this one and watch the original instead!"	0.0
"You will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation	 and the novelty probably won't wear off on the first	 second or third viewing	 but you?ll be drawn in by the characters which are so simple yet intriguing	 that you may find yourself actually caring for them in an unexpected way	 which may or may not make you feel a little childish due to the medium.<br /><br />Disney continues to firmly hold the title of ""Greatest Animation in the World""	 with ""A Bug?s Life"" standing as one of their greatest achievements. One of the innovative attachments being the delightful ""out-takes"" added to the end of the film. The DVD has two sets of these out-takes where as I?m told the VHS cassette has one alternating version per tape. The DVD also features ""Gerry?s Game"" which is a delightful little PIXAR short that was also shown prior to the film in theaters.<br /><br />This is by far the superior insect-film in comparison to Dreamworks? ""Antz""	 which in all fairness is pretty good	 but lacks something in the animation and in the story development and characters. If you look at the star voices of both films	 ""Antz"" is largely cast with big name ""movie"" stars with a few familiar ""TV"" star voices	 where ""A Bug?s Life"" is just the opposite	 loaded with ""TV"" stars with Kevin Spacey as the only stand out exception. But the difference in quality is distinct and obvious.<br /><br />Dreamworks can?t be blamed or surprised though	 when you go head to head with Disney	 you have your work cut out for you.

The film is funny	 heartwarming	 features great acting	 and beautiful photography. i don't know if the film has distribution	 but I hope it does - or will - soon. this is destined to be a real indie gem. it even has music by my favorite band the silver jews! the only disappointment was that molly parker wasn't there at the screening. even without her there... this was hands down the best film i saw at the festival."	1.0
"This movie is just plain terrible. Poor John Savage had to stoop this low in order to be in another movie. He stars as a rare type of vampire that is to help a lady that looks like a washed out and thrown in the streets hooker that is a dancer at a local strip club. She acidently tastes a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those rare vampires as they get carried away making out on the floor of the dressing room. Savage is then assigned by a short leader of this rare vampire breed that looks like a cross between 80's punk rock and one of the Olsen twins with purple hair. This movie just gets all to crazy with Savage rapping and dancing with a midget with a tattooed spider on his head	 also one of the rare. He quotes the Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante and I just had to laugh. This just gets rediculas. And then the most gross special effects that they could come up with is Corri throwing up her organs and pulling them out of her mouth. And you can tell that that is all to fake. Her son doesn't know what to do with his moms new identity and becomes more of a pest than an object of serenity. I enjoy a good vampire film	 believe me I do but I just HATED this one. Even the photography stinks	 in and out blurs with the camera switching this way and that trying to make it look like the vampires move to fast for the camera to keep up and then the camera turns all to bright in the scene of Savage chasing the son of Corri around till he blinds himself.

"Somerset Maugham's characters are brought to life in RKO's ""Of Human Bondage""; but the movie is a too skeletal version of the novel	 with Bette Davis' star-making performance sucking up all of the energy. Otherwise	 it's the story of Leslie Howard (as Philip Carey); he dreams of becoming a painter	 but is told he has no talent for the arts. As the film progresses	 Mr. Howard's struggles	 instead	 to become a doctor. His efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts; though successful in medicine	 his painting seemed easier - also	 note the symbolism of his disability	 a ""club foot"" (explained in the film).<br /><br />Along the way (right away	 in this version)	 Howard becomes infatuated with waitress Davis (as Mildred Rogers). Davis' characterization of ""Mildred"" is extraordinary	 culminating in a spectacular speech	 when she tells Howard	 among other things	 that she had to ""WIPE MY MOUTH!"" after kissing him. Howard also performs well	 but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for Davis; so	 their performances are wasted. <br /><br />Still	 a film to watch for the acting	 including some good supporting players. Bette Davis' characterization was famous for inspiring a ""write-in"" campaign for the 1934 ""Best Actress"" Academy Award. For the record	 she placed third. The results were: <br /><br />1. Claudette Colbert - ""It Happened One Night"" <br /><br />2. Norma Shearer - ""The Barretts of Wimpole Street"" <br /><br />3. Bette Davis - ""Of Human Bondage"" <br /><br />4.

"I doubt Jigsaw was hip even at the time	 the whole LSD theme married to a murder mystery being a patently obvious attempt to grab a young audience of the era without in the least truly showing any understanding of the sixties counterculture. The dated aspect aside	 Jigsaw suffers from many problems	 including overwrought acting	 silly and stilted dialogue	 LSD flashbacks that go on interminably long even after the point has been hammered home in the first 60 seconds	 a failure to create any true suspense even though the actual plot is	 on paper	 a great vehicle to do just that	 and an ending that is so trite and predictable (not to mention reminiscent of a lot of bad television shows) that the climax is actually an anti-climax. If it was a better movie	 we might be able to suspend disbelief on a few things where it would help enjoyment	 but the weaknesses are so glaring they only serve to highlight the improbabilities viewers might otherwise overlook. I saw Jigsaw on television and it is definitely late night TV fare meant to fill airspace and pass the time to kill somebody's insomnia rather than anything anybody ought to actively seek out.

From the opening credits with that creepy opening song to the very chaotic ending	 there is something insane	 sad and scary at the same time	 and it keeps ringing in your head: sometimes dead is better! <br /><br />I don't think it would be useful to relate the whole story again. All you need to know is it starts from point A (the most perfect situation for a happy American family) and step by step drowns to point B (which is	 believe me	 the very end of all joy). The music is perfect	 the story makes sense	 the special effects are cool	 and the Pet Sematary is the last place on earth I would be. Like I said	 sometimes dead is better!"	1.0
"This film has a rotting core of flexible morality	 and yet a quirky sense of justice. So many of the regular Joes among us would love to ""stick it to the MAN"". The ""MAN"" in this case is represented by several different characters. Mr. Keller	 who Carla reports to at her office. Later	 Paul owes 70 large to Mr. Marchand the club owner. And then there is Paul's Parole Officer. There seems to be so much question about this last character's side story. Reviewers point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well crafted subterranean game of ping-pong between our two protagonists	 escalating tit-for-tat until their lives change dramatically. They are beholden to each agent of the ""MAN"". One or both could be fired	 killed	 or imprisoned if they don't do as they are told.<br /><br />The film has a sense of relief at the end. Carla finally gets laid. Her boss is forced out for being a jerk. Mr. Club Owner is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom. They get the $money$. And... they need not worry about reporting in to the Parole Officer	 because HIS moral weakness leads him to stash his wandering wife in the basement (or whatever the police found to arrest him). It is a critical subconscious trigger to the lock tumbler that wound us up so tight. Never mind that someone else may get Paul's file later to supervise his release; for the moment they are free! They might even get away with it! <br /><br />Woohoo...<br /><br />They STUCK IT TO THE MAN!"	1.0
"An old saying goes ""If you think you have problems	 visit a hospital."" That has been updated in recent years to ""If you think you have problems	 watch a TV talk show...especially Jerry Springer's!"" This movie is one of those that is so bad	 it's good! That's why I gave it a seven-it's all right	 but not great. It's a great way to waste 95 minutes	 just as the daily talk show is advertised as ""an hour of your life you'll never get back!"" All the familiar themes are here...unfaithful husbands/boyfriends	 the wildest audience on television	 women flashing Jerry	 etc. The shocker was watching Molly Hagan	 who normally plays sweet characters (""Seinfeld"" and ""Herman's Head"") playing a trailer-trash mom and Jaime Pressly (""My Name Is Earl"") as her equally trashy daughter	 performing sexual favors for virtually every man with whom they came in contact. The men (including the staff producer) were presented as quintessential lunkheads who deserved what they got. I don't want to spoil or reveal everything but the movie plays like the daily show. Here in Phoenix	 it's shown back-to-back for two hours every morning and	 after that	 everything else seems to pale. Again	 I give this movie a seven...it's good but not great. Jerry Springer is best taken in small one hour doses."	1.0
"I saw this on cable recently and kinda enjoyed it. I've been reading the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half more than the first half. Personally	 I enjoyed the first story (too bad that wasn't extended.) The second story	 I thought	 was cliched. And that ""California Dreaming	"" if I hear that one more time... Chungking Express is alright	 but it's not something that mainstream audiences will catch on to see	 like ""Crouching Tiger."""	0.0
"Yes it may be goofy and may not seem as funny as many high budget comedies out there	 but this movie is truly hilarious if you really watch it. Tim Meadows has always struck me as being funny off of the Saturday Night Live show. Whenever he would do this character on the show I would crack up laughing. So after I saw this was going to be playing on Comedy Central one night I decided to check it out. All in all I was farily impressed with this movie	 because it wasn't meant to win any Oscars or become comedy of the year	 but it did entertain the Saturday Night Live fans that love the Ladies Man character. This movie is also packed with some highly quotable lines that can be recited for years to come."	1.0
"Cliché-ridden story of an impending divorce - or is it? - through the eyes of a 6 year-old child. Corny dialogue	 cardboard characters	 stock situations	 a red herring zombie sub-plot and	 worst of all	 absolutely no payoff	 either emotionally or dramatically.<br /><br />Does no-one teach creative writing any more? The true sign of a weak storyteller - when you cannot create any kind of satisfying denouement - just end the story. I'm compelled to ask	 ""what made you think this was a story worth telling in the first place!?"" <br /><br />Good	 but wasted	 debut by child actor Anthony De Marco - the rest of the cast was	 at best	 forgettable. And they wonder why no-one watches indie films! This is ninety minutes of my life I will never get back."	0.0
"If you have ever read and enjoyed a novel by Tom Robbins you will appreciate this movie as a whole-hearted attempt to translate his outrageously unconventional writing style into a workable piece of big screen art. The actors and the direction of this film are both good. <br /><br />The only trouble with the film	 as I can see it	 is that Robbins can relate ideas and sentiments with his words that were still beyond Hollywood's capabilities at the time this film was shot.<br /><br />Given both the irreverence of today's movies	 as well as the willingness and abilityof today's audiences to delve into the bizarre	 I think ""Even Cowgirls... would receive a better reception today than it did when it was originally released."	1.0
"maybe i need to have my head examined	but i thought this was a pretty good movie.the CG is not too bad.i have seen worse.the look of the creatures(and by creatures i mean the good and the bad snake)was pretty cool.the action scenes involving the snakes was really good	i thought.there are some lapses in logic at times	and the story doesn't always make sense.but for a creature feature	there are a lot worse.a lot of the other creatures seemed lifted from other movies	so it's not wholly original.i think the gist of the story is original though.there is a bit of similarity to Godzilla(the Big budget American version)which liked a lot.i didn't like this movie as much	but i still say it was pretty good.i also liked the music.all in all	i think Dragon Wars is about a 7/10"	1.0
"What can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude? ""The Sopranos"" has literally redefined television as we know it. It has broken all rules	 and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is flawless	 the writing	 directing	 and for me	 most of all	 the acting. Watching this show you'll find yourself realizing that these characters are NOT real. The acting tricks you into thinking there is a real Tony Soprano	 or any character. This show is also very versatile. Some people don't watch the show because it's violent	 it's not all about the violence	 it's about business	 family	 and many deeper things that all depend on what you	 as a fan see. For me	 I don't like when people refer to the show	 a show about the Mafia. For me	 it's a show about family. A family who	 through generations	 happen to be apart of the mob. Overall this is a masterpiece of a show. This is what television should be. Right here. Complex characters from stunning acting	 magnificent story lines from brilliant writing	 and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? A show that defines excellence	 and dares to be different."	1.0
"I must admit	 when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as ""Steamy Romance"" I was a little bit skeptical. ""Steamy""? In a movie from 1968?? I was prepared for disappointment. And when I realized it was shot entirely in black & white	 I knew my erotic hopes were dashed.<br /><br />Boy	 was I wrong! Not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance -- the discovery of first love	 fear of the secret being found out	 a sudden unexpected end -- but at times this movie was downright erotic. You will soon forget that it is shot in black & white. The cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years. And the performances from the two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and memorable. OK	 so they're both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls. It's 1968. Do you really expect teenagers from the '60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this? Many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then. Anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much.<br /><br />I think this movie was way ahead of its time. The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination	 opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown.<br /><br />I have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here. As for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action: Although it won't be all you expect	 I don't think you'll be too	 too disappointed."	1.0
"Homicide: The Movie proved to be a good wrap-up to a well-written	 well-directed	 and well-acted series. Loose ends were tied up that weren't properly addressed at the end of the final season. The entire series	 and especially the movie	 provided a life-like look at life (and death) in Baltimore	 a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate. My attraction to the series began long before I moved to Baltimore	 but once I experienced life here for myself	 I realized how realistic it was. And the movie certainly retained that spirit. I will certainly miss new original episodes of the series	 but am very grateful to NBC and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of Charm City."	1.0
"Over-powered mobile suits that can annihilate entire armies - Check! Weapons that hardly need to be aimed and still annihilate everything - Check! Mobile suits based on angels - Check!<br /><br />OK - its a Gundam series. This one	 Gundam Wing	 has good character development	 real-world complexity	 interesting ideas and some pretty eye-candy.<br /><br />With characters	 the initially weak Relena Dorlan (later Peacecraft	 then back to Dorlan) gets stronger and more independent (although is still absolutely besotted with Heero Yuy	 the series main character). The aforementioned Heero	 initially a cold	 hard butcherer	 becomes more and more human	 while still remaining in-character. And seeing the lost Millardo Peacecraft (whos nomm de guerre is Zechs Marquise) float between OZ	 freelance	 and command of White Fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own creations.<br /><br />The complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good - reflecting how the real world works. However	 in 49 half-hour episodes	 it does become a bit of a liability in that this complexity isn't used to its full potential.<br /><br />The ideas at the core of the series - the necessity of fighting	 the desire for peace	 etc - are ones that resonate even today. In retrospect	 the series was ahead of its time	 what with the ""War on Terrorism"" and all. But its exploration of these ideas	 the monologues	 especially those of Treize Kushrenada	 is an incredible dramatic piece	 forming some of the best writing in the series.<br /><br />But that sometimes good writing is also sometimes extremely poor	 which dramatically causes it to lose some of its edge.<br /><br />In terms of eye-candy	 which is what this one has in bucketloads	 everything from the mobile suits to the battleship Libra (No not the tampons you idiot!) is wells designed	 and explodes in big balls of orange (which is bad	 because better animation would've had better explosions). But who cares?! Stuff explodes	 and thats all that matters.<br /><br />In short though	 the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss out on a few episodes	 you've missed out on a lot. The poor writing can leave you cringing	 and sometimes the animation makes you go ""WTF?!?!"" But this is made up for in its classic animation style	 its scale	 sparks of incredible dialogue	 and its more mature exploration that one expects of such Japenese animations."	1.0

"I had to give this film a 10 simply because it did what so many films thrown at black audiences have FAILED MISERABLY to do. This film was void of all the video whore clichés	 and it also skipped the gangsters	 rappers	 and foul language. It examined several relationships among physicians	 African Americans	 and African American male/female romantic relationships on a completely new and refreshing level. I was highly impressed with the films careful mix of light headed humor with some pretty tough and heavy issues. The film will leave you feeling happy and sad all at the same time. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival as well. It premiered at AMC Loews Boston and I truly hope this film makes it to much larger audiences. Black People (and EVERYONE else) would LOVE a movie like this- if only the industry was SMART enough to put them out there!<br /><br />As an extra- if your a doctor	 a resident	 a medical student	 a premedical student	 married to a doctor	 have a doctor sibling	 have a doctor in the family	 or know a great doctor period- they would love this film as well. It portrayed residency and the practice in a true-to-life way that was greatly appreciated by the doctors	 residents	 and medical students who viewed the film. Dennis Cooper completely his residency in internal medicine- so he definitely applied his knowledge/experience to the film and that is greatly apparent."	1.0
"A plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side pro-life and the other a destroyer of a demon's seed. The horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific	 but	 instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death	 despite the title itself. Being a fan of Masters of Horror since the beginning	 this ridiculous plot twist with it's sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon. I view this episode as being thrown together from the get go	 never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to ""The End"".."	0.0
"If I hadn't read his name on the DVD cover	 I never would have suspected that this rather gushy and old fashioned musical was made by a man so closely associated with the French New Wave. In fact	 the film is so far from that	 that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s	 New Wave auteurs would have absolutely hated this type of film--it's so...so...unreal. And	 it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films. This isn't necessarily a bad thing--just a very surprising thing.<br /><br />What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this film--especially when there are so many better French musicals out there. The songs in this film were simply not particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so bland and stereotypical. If I had to see another rich person who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit	 I was going to puke.<br /><br />The bottom line is that like American musicals	 not every French musical is gold. This film is not another ""Les parapluies de Cherbourg"" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or ""Huit Femmes"" (EIGHT WOMEN) and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou	 I can't see much reason to recommend it as anything other than a dull oddity."	0.0
"Dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love. ""Wanders"" is probably not the word. I should say he fixates on the past girlfriend. He recalls to the day when the relationship ended. The dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions. He fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went. I'm not a counselor	 but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage???? Dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age (also divorced) who	 instead of being ""turned off"" by his creepiness	 starts to become interested in him. Did I mention how creepy Dave is? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person. He doesn't move his arms when he walks	 either. It's just weird. Too make a long story short	 Dave plots to hunt down Mary (the old gal friend) and kill her...err...I mean confront her. He does so. Which was really creepy. He believes her to be married	 yet he STILL flies half-way across the country to meet her. He stakes out her house to make sure she is alone	 before he ""drops in"" on her. He has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less	 and flies back to the new young girlfriend. We enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comedic value. I am still entertaining the wife with my Dave impressions....""I heard another Dave & Mary song!"""	0.0
"I just watched this film 15 minutes ago	 and I still have no idea what I just watched. Mainly I think it's a film about an internet S&M ""star"" of CD Roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online. She's murdered by someone	 which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 FBI agents to investigate the death. The local homicide division of Big City	 USA is also investigating	 though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the CD ROMs which he claims are as realistic ""as the real thing"". I know. Wow.<br /><br />Michael Madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him. He's in the film for about 15 minutes	 and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason. I won't even explain the ending	 because quite frankly I can't make it out myself. But before the final scene	 we're treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film. Honestly	 they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all.<br /><br />All in all	 stay away from this film. I got it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied. Like	 playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly. That for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining."	0.0
"Not even Bob Hope	 escorted by a raft of fine character actors	 can save this poorly written attempt at wartime comedy	 as his patented timing has little which which to work. The plot involves a Hollywood film star named Don Bolton (Hope)	 and his attempt to evade military service at the beginning of World War II	 followed by his enlistment by mistake in a confused attempt to court a colonel's daughter (Dorothy Lamour). Bolton's agent	 played by Lynne Overman	 and his assistant	 portrayed by Eddie Bracken	 enlist with him and the three are involved in various escapades regarding training exercises	 filmed in the Malibu	 California	 hills. Paramount budgeted handsomely for this effort	 employing some of its top specialists	 but direction by the usually reliable David Butler was flaccid	 and this must be attributed to a missing comedic element in the scenario. A shift toward the end of the film to create an opportunity for heroism by Bolton is still-born with poor stunt work and camera action in evidence. Oddly	 Lynne Overman is given the best lines and this veteran master of the sneer does very well by them. Dorothy Lamour looks lovely and acts nicely	 as well	 and it is ever a delight to see and hear Clarence Kolb	 as her father	 whose voice is unique on screen or radio	 but there is little they can do to save this film	 cursed as it is with an error in script assignment."	0.0
"A talking parrot isn't a hugely imaginative idea for a new film	 but Paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant	 heartwarming film that will delight the whole family. It manages to bridge the gap between sentimental trash and cruel harshness during Marie and Paulie's separation	 and all the events in the film lead to a hugely satisfying emotional conclusion. The animal training is well-done - everyone will be affected when Paulie spreads his wings and flies for the first time. Paulie is a great character and should have received way more success	 though this film wasn't a highlight of 1998	 unlike Saving Private Ryan. This hour and a half will surely be an enjoyable one and one that you will remember. Paulie's story is a moving	 sad	 happy and interesting one - from the moment he is first seen to the moment he is united with his original owner	 you will enjoy following him and watching him learning about friendship and the grim realities of life along the way. Not one to be missed if you have any kind of heart or emotion. 9/10"	1.0
"This is truly terrible: painfully irritating stylised performers screech and mug gratingly incoherent dialogues which take place in scenes which seem to have no purpose	 no beginning	 middle or end	 cut together without any apparent narrative or even cognitive intention	 all in the service of some entirely uninteresting and almost undetectable ""story"". What makes it worse is the film's pretentions to ""style"": suddenly a remote-head crane shot spirals downwards	 and	 without any apparent reason there are sudden whip-pans or wobblyhand-held sections: all this ""style"" merely serves to magnify the almost unbelievably huge misconception of the project and the almost offensive vacuity of the material. Definitely a candidate for the worst film ever made."	0.0
"...would probably be the best word to describe this film (in my opinion). besides one great heck of a fan service for fan girls (well	 that was redundant~)	 it was the story that blew me away. hurray for Takahisa Zeze and Gackt! and i know some people will disagree with me on this one	 but it wasn't any of the big three actors (the guys that played Sho	 son	 and Kei) that gave the best performance (for me	 anyway). it was Taro Yamamoto	 boy #5 from battle Royale! <br /><br />don't get me wrong	 i like Hyde	 i worship his voice	 but the problem was that some of his scenes came a little bit 'off'	 but i loved that scene where he danced with the dead guy's body killing the other guys. and Gackt wasn't at all that bad too	 i preferred how his character was kind of aloof from the start. nothing much i can say about my background on lee-Hom Wang	 i won't pretend to know him	 but he carried his own weight with the star-studded cast. <br /><br />this movie paved the way for one of the best collaborations I've ever heard	 Orenji No Taiyou (forgive my spelling if it's wrong). while the complete song lasts about nine minutes	 you wouldn't notice the length because you'd be enjoying hearing Gackt and Hyde together. <br /><br />anyway	 this movie is a must-see not only for the fans (huge fan base~) but for those who enjoy sci-fi	 futuristic movies	 Asian-style."	1.0

"Watching CBS's ""Surrender	 Dorothy""	 I kept wondering why Diane Keaton would want to be in it (not because it's a television movie--with the dearth of enticing roles for slightly older actresses	 it isn't any wonder why Academy Award winning performers such as Keaton turn to TV--but because it offers no opportunities for Keaton to shine). A single mother	 grieving the sudden death of her twenty-something daughter	 imposes upon--and gradually becomes friends with--the group of young people her daughter was close to at the time of her accident. Adapted from the novel	 this teleplay gives us a group of self-absorbed characters one would cross the street to avoid. Aside from being coarse and dim	 these phony people are incredibly unconvincing	 as is the tidy scenario and the bungalow near the beach where the kids reside (one young man	 who wears muscle shirts to tell us he's gay	 hears Diane Keaton say	 ""Surrender	 Dorothy"" and actually asks	 ""That's from ""The Wizard of Oz""	 right?""...no	 genius	 it's from ""Citizen Kane""!). Keaton may have wanted to do this material based on the subject matter of confronting death. She tries turning this distinctly unlikable woman into a shadow of her own personage (lots of kooky outfits)	 but it doesn't sit well with the viewer since Keaton has always been warmly likable and flexible in a flaky way. Here	 she's a crazed harpy who doesn't learn many lessons on her journey of self-discovery (the movie quickly forgets it's about a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mom	 who appears to be an overage hippie who has never lost anyone close to her). This is the kind of film actors promote on talk shows with the caveat	 ""It should help a lot of grieving mothers out there"". I can't imagine it helping anyone since it is intrinsically a downer	 muddled and baffling. It's deranged."	0.0
"Tromaville High has become an amoral wasteland of filth thanks to the aftereffects of the nearby nuclear plant's accidental release of toxic waste.<br /><br />Unrestrained chaos crammed with absurd violence and crude behavior. Rather horrible	 obviously intended to be	 mess of a film with the filmmakers cutting loose the reins allowing the untalented cast free reign to ham it up. Craft was far down Troma's list of objectives for this gory sleazefest. The honor society are punks with eerie face paint jobs and wacky outfits.

"THE ODD COUPLE is the classic film version of Neil Simon's most famous play about a TV newswriter named Felix Unger	 who is an obsessive neat freak	 who moves in with his divorced best friend	 Oscar Madison	 a sportswriter and complete slob	 after his wife Frances throws him out of their apartment. Already divorced	 Oscar takes his best friend in and regrets it from the moment he does it. Neil Simon's classic comedy first came to Broadway with Art Carney playing Felix and Walter Matthau playing Oscar. Jack Lemmon takes over for Carney in the film version with a memorable performance as Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role but so vividly real that he brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure that is Felix Unger. Matthau	 fortunately	 was allowed to recreate his role as Oscar	 a one-of-a-kind gem of comic performance that provides consistent laughs throughout. This teaming of Lemmon and Matthau turned out to be comic gold that was re-visited in nine other films. With both of these actors no longer with us	 the viewing of this classic becomes more touching but no less hilarious. Simon's play has been nicely expanded for the screen with a silent prologue chronicling a depressed Felix's suicide attempt that is a winner. The supporting cast includes Herb Edelman	 John Fiedler	 Larry Haines	 and David Sheiner as Oscar's poker playing buddies and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as the Piedgon Sisters	 blind dates of Oscar and Felix. Of course	 it later became an excellent TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman	 but there's nothing like the original. A joy from start to finish."	1.0

"Interesting how much more realistic Brosnan's performance is to that of the original James Bond novels when compared to the bond films. He's neurotic	 paranoid	 an alcoholic and a womanizer to boot. This is perfect break for him	 even so much as to make fun of the bond icon. ""I'm a mess	 a parody of myself"" he says. It doesn't get any better than that. I just finished reading Dr.No and this is very much how Ian Fleming had portrayed James Bond. Personally I never liked Brosnan as Bond because he fit the icon too closely. There was nothing for him to personalize the character with	 as compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. Its great to see Brosnan play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall. A shallow character trying to come to an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has no background dealing with. It's an impressive portrayal	 and having Greg Kinear to ground him	 is just poetic. This movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in ""My Blue Heaven""	 but more genuine in their coping mechanisms."	1.0
"Just imagine what school would have been like in a world like this: the kids are one big gang who have really good taste in music and unite against bad headmasters and teachers. ""Rock 'N' Roll High School"" is taking place in that world. It's like a Ramones record coming to life. The characters are all as silly	 innocent and charming as the Ramones' songs	 and the music itself is	 of course	 fantastic. High school comedies have really changed over the years	 if you compare a movie like ""American Pie"" with this late 70's classic	 where no tasteless sex jokes are made at all. Since a remake is apparently in the works	 it can probably be expected that the charm of the original will get lost along the way and will get replaced by vulgar	 half-funny dick jokes	 as Bill Hicks used to call them. However	 the main problem will be that the Ramones CANNOT be replaced. They were the perfect band for this movie and no one else could even come close to taking their place. So	 the best thing to do would be to leave the original alone	 as quirky and charming as it is. Gabba-gabba hey!"	1.0
"Saw this movie recently and had higher hopes. Not so much based upon the director	 who hadn't made a cinematographic release before	 but more based upon its cast. Harvey Keitel	 Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (lead role in Body double	 a Brian De Palma masterpiece) have all starred in great movies. Not together though	 and this fact hasn't exactly changed because of this one.<br /><br />The film is unbelievable	 very predictable and cliché. The only thing that might make it slightly appealing is the selection of locations on which it's been shot. In my humble opinion: don't waste your time on this one."	0.0
"Jesus Christ	 I can't believe I've wasted my time watching this movie. I only watched because I have such a crush on Jordan Ladd. But watching this film almost put me off her. This is absolutely awful! I could have been watching Survivor Series 93 over this.<br /><br />The lead guy in this was so bland and generic. I would love it if the great Mistuharu Misawa Tiger Drove '91'd his ass through a glass window. I was enraging every time he was saying ""lake"" and ""cabin"". I'd kick his ass.<br /><br />Jordan Ladd	 on the other hand	 was absolutely wonderful. A true angel. But she couldn't even save this utter joke of a film. Sadly	 she couldn't even act like she was off her nut when she took that truth drug. It looked hilarious.<br /><br />I also loved the bit where Jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her. It reminded me of a time where...nevermind.<br /><br />Anayways	 do watch this film because of it's awfulness."	0.0
"I have to agree with everyone else that has posted.<br /><br />I watched it quite a while ago but I'll tell you	 whenever I hear certain music from this anime I am reminded of the story	 the beautiful animation	 the characters and the feeling I got when watching it	 and it does make me cry(such a happy yet sad feeling). I do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they didn't explain things properly but it didn't ruin any part of the viewing experience.<br /><br />I was into this anime so much that after the end I just had to do some research(and watch the ending a few more times) and I found all my answers and a whole lot more. I love how they configured historical legends to fit into this anime	 it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot more.(I've always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime)<br /><br />I do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story	 well built characters(some mysterious)and a bit of fantasy action.<br /><br />Also	 even though this was based on a H-game it doesn't have any of that stuff in it and I actually prefer it this way.(I have no problem with mature anime	 in most cases I prefer it)"	1.0
"Well...now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for his ""House of 1	000 Corpses"" crapfest	 I can now rest in peace. Nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in ""The House of Seven Corpses	"" but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot (ha!) anyway	 to kill the bloody amateurs making a low-rent horror flick in his former abode! In Hell House (sorry	 I don't remember the actual name of the residence)	 a bunch of mysterious	 unexplained deaths took place long ago; some	 like arthritic Lurch stand-in John Carradine (whose small role provides the film's only worthwhile moments)	 attribute it to the supernatural; bellowing film director John Ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum. The result comes across like ""Satan's School for Girls"" (catchy title; made-for-TV production values; intriguing plot) crossed with ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"" (low-rent movie about low-rent movie makers who wake the dead); trouble is	 it's nowhere near as entertaining or fun. ""The House of Seven Corpses"" is dead at frame one	 and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis	 dragging us along for every aching second..."	0.0
"I really enjoyed this episode. Seeing The Flash	 Cyborg	 Green Arrow	 and Aquaman (even though all he did was swim) made my eyes widen. To see most of the founders of the Justice League trying to bring down Lex Luthor is what i've been waiting for. This sounds a bit off topic	 but making a live action Justice League show would definitely make me have a reason to shove everything that i usually do during the week down the drain just to watch one episode. This is the thrill i got from watching this episode. I wish they had made this episode a little longer	 like a two hour special	 because i felt that one hour of the Justice League wasn't enough. Now before i bore you (unless i already have with my rambling) i just want to say	 Smallville is cool again. It sort of lost its touch when the show started focusing on Lana. But i'm sure the writers will just fall back into that loop hole. :( So enjoy this episode. Who knows when another good one's going to come out. Catch it again this Thursday	 Feb. 22	 if you missed the first airing."	1.0
"Here's the kind of love story that I do enjoy watching. And mostly	 it's for two reasons. One	 it concentrates of young people	 VERY young people. People who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time	 or at least think they are. All of us have been there in our lives and ""The Man in the Moon"" is a magnificent reflection upon our memories	 maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced. The second reason is that is a love triangle. And I do believe that as teens	 it's the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love	 or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs	 will believe it for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />The cast of ""The Man in the Moon"" is full of great talented names. It stars Sam Waterston	 who is truly a versatile actor	 well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict	 yet caring and wise fathers as in this film. Also there is Tess Harper	 Jason London	 and a young	 young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the young	 talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road	 she's going to win the Academy Award. All members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay	 they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations. As if it all really happened. This the kind of movie that I would like to see come out more often. Love story or not. I would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or disbelievable in any way."	1.0
"...said a couple exiting the movie theater just as I was entering to watch this. Hmm	 not a good sign	 but who knows? Different strokes for different folks	 after all. Well	 nope. They were being kind. Godard has released work that is passionate (Contempt)	 entertaining (Band of Outsiders)	 sometimes both (My Life to Live). This is just dull intellectualism	 that grates on the nerves pretty quickly. During my showing	 literally half of the audience had walked out by the end of the film. If only I had been so wise."	0.0
"Otto Preminger directs this light as a feather story. Bohemian Jean Seberg and her equally bohemian widower father David Niven holiday in the South of France with nutty Mylène Demongeot. Things are fine until family friend Deborah Kerr shows up. Nivens	 a degenerate womanizer	 finds the conquest of Kerr too hard to resist. That's fine with Seberg	 as long as Niven loves her and leaves her (as he's done with all the women in his past...including Demongeot). When it appears as though she's becoming second banana in Niven's life	 Seberg exact revenge on Kerr. Preminger tells the story in flashbacks from Seberg's perspective and cleverly combines black and white with sunnier color scenes. The cinematography by Georges Périnal is stunning. The film features some of Preminger's least heavy-handed direction	 although he rarely allows any close-ups	 which makes it difficult to make out what the actors are really feeling. Arthur Laurents wrote the script and it's full of acidic dialog and funny scenes (mostly involving bird-brained Demongeot). Seberg acquits herself fairly well	 but Niven is at his least appealing...and he shows no chemistry with either Seberg or Kerr. Preminger really mis-steps with that casting. It's a role that seems tailor made for someone closer to Charles Boyer. With Geoffrey Horne as Seberg's would-be suitor and Martita Hunt as his daffy mother. Juliette Gréco	 playing herself	 sings the title song in a Paris nightclub. The great titles are by Preminger regular Saul Bass."	0.0
"As has been stated countless times	 ""The Hills Have Eyes 2"" is NOT a remake of the (generally disregarded) mid-'80s sequel to Wes Craven's 1977 original. But wishing to give this postmodern sequel-to-a-remake the official stamp of Diminishing Returns	 Craven himself (a double threat alongside his son	 Jonathan) has decided to pen a film that is of the same quality--in plain English	 HORRIBLE. Former music-video director Martin Weisz takes the reins from Alexandre Aja	 and is clearly in way over his head--yet one wonders how anyone could have created a watchable film from the Cravens' Screen writing 101 scrawl. Not only are the characters (in this case	 a gang of goofball National Guards(wo)men sent to investigate the turbulent hills of the original remake) completely obnoxious and prone to really annoying genre pitfalls (played without a lick of irony	 mind you)	 but they are constantly cracking jokes that aren't funny. After viewing their total ineptitude during a training exercise	 their fate against the repulsive	 roaming cannibals is painfully obvious. Only this time out--as in the original '80s sequel--the script is so simplistic (barely existent	 actually) that any potential subtext is jettisoned in favor of upping the ante in repulsive shocks (we're treated to a combo childbirth-murder during the opening credits	 plus a gratuitous rape for those who haven't ejected the DVD by the midpoint!). Even the mutants in this outing are personality-free freaks of no memorable stature--the tacky	 rubbery-looking makeup FX seems	 like the rest of the film	 to be trying to hide its face from embarrassment. I really groaned at the lame 'surprise' at the end of Aja's otherwise excellent film	 and the producers quite literally go for broke at the end of ""Hills 2	"" setting the stage--VERY lamely setting the stage--for a third installment...yet the Cravens and Weisz have created a film that is such a cynical bastardization of what made the 1977/2006 versions work that they'd be hard-pressed to find an audience after this insulting slap in the face."	0.0

"This was a great movie with a good cast	 all of them hitting on all cylinders. And when Dianne Keaton is at her best	 well	 it just doesn't get any better than that. But Tom Everett Scott	 always underrated	 was even better. He should be a star. <br /><br />My only complaint is with one aspect of the screenplay. None of the characters ever acknowledged that the dead daughter wasn't always a good person. And neither was her mother	 played by Keaton. At one point she breaks a promise she made to one character not to reveal that he had been sleeping around. <br /><br />One of the other commentators said the movie had a ""political agenda"". That is a baffling thing to say. There was no politics at all in this movie."	1.0
"What is most disturbing about this film is not that school killing sprees like the one depicted actually happen	 but that the truth is they are carried out by teenagers like Cal and Andre...normal kids with normal families. By using a hand held camera technique a la Blair Witch	 Ben Coccio succeeds in bringing us into the lives of two friends who have some issues with high school	 although we aren't ever told exactly what is behind those issues. They seem to be typical -a lot of people hate high school	 so what? A part of you just doesn't believe they will ever carry out the very well thought out massacre on Zero Day. The surveillance camera scenes in the school during the shooting are made all the more powerful for that reason. You can't believe it's really happening	 and that it's really happened. The hand held camera technique also creates the illusion that this is not a scripted movie	 a brilliant idea given the subject matter."	1.0
"Deliverance is John Boorman's 1972 horror/thriller movie about a group of four Atlanta businessmen (Burt Reynolds	 Jon Voight	 Ned Beatty and Ronnie Cox)	 that undertake a canoe trip down the Cahulawassee River before the river is dammed. Along the way	 a raft (no pun intended) of unpleasant things happen to the men. Despite the nasty happenings in this picture	 Boorman captures the natural beauty of the river nicely. The location was really chosen well. Indeed	 this would still be a very nice film to watch	 had the canoe trip gone smoothly. The lush forests and gentle landscape only make the horror more horrible. Not only is the location scenic	 but also beautifully shot thanks to cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond. It has been said that Burt Reynolds' performance as the outdoorsman	 Lewis	 is the star acting role in this film. I reckon however	 that Jon Voight steals the show with his role as the suburban family man	 Ed	 who is rapidly forced to change his demeanour in order to survive. In fact	 the scene in which climbs the cliff was not a stuntman. It was Voight himself. To cut costs the filming wasn't insured and the actors did their own stunts. The soundtrack is particularly noteworthy. Eric Weissberg's and Steve Mendel's performance on guitar and banjo as part of the Duelling Banjos sequence remains one of the most awesome pieces of soundtrack in the history of cinema for the sheer intensity of its performance. At a couple of other points in the movie	 we are treated to more	 softer	 banjo music which provides a very pleasant accompaniment to the trip down the river For all the good points of this film	 I did find it a little lacking in purpose. It doesn't build suspense very well and it isn't really as gruesome as we have been led to believe. The plot itself is somewhat poor and it doesn't really go anywhere. Nevertheless	 this movie has enough good points to get my recommendation. I did like it but for fans of gore	 there isn't really much of it. None really	 in fact. It isn't so much a horror film as an adventure film that turns a little bit sour. Think of it like Rambo: First Blood meets Three Men In A Boat. Look out for a very young Charley Boorman as Ed's son. I did like this movie	 the soundtrack	 cinematography and acting earns it a well deserved 7 out of 10."	1.0
"It's got Christopher Lee	 it's got huge banks of 1970s computers that make Teletype noises as letters appear on the screen	 it's got radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsing thrumming noises	 it's got volcanoes! evil aliens disguised as nuns! tidal waves! earthquakes! exploding cars! exploding coffee machines! and as a climax the entire planet blows up. How on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly	 mind-numbingly DULL? The answer	 my friend is because 90% of this movie is made up of establishing shots	 most of them involving long tracks	 pans	 or zooms in combinations	 or occasionally all three	 that do nothing except give the crew something to do. There are endless shots of our protagonists driving	 getting in and out of cars	 driving again	 walking around looking at stuff	 getting in cars and driving... I just sat there watching endless parade of nothingness in stupefaction muttering ""Say something	 please somebody	 just say something... DO something... anything!...""<br /><br />The dialogue	 when it does come	 is terrible.<br /><br />""Maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours."" was a typically meaningless line. The script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock footage	 justified in this speech from Lee as the head alien:<br /><br />""The planet Earth has emitted an over-abundance of diseases	 they are contaminating the Universe. All the planets light years away from here will suffer unless it is destroyed!"" <br /><br />This is is Neanderthal SF script writing. This is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of 1950's Japanese monster suit movies aimed at 7 year olds. It is	 and I collect such things	 the most god-awful line from an English language SF movie since Buster Crabbe retired. It beggars belief that this movie was released in the same year as Star Wars and Close Encounters.<br /><br />Lee	 who always struck me as a smart	 useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limits	 delivers his lines as if he is going to kill his agent for getting him into this pile of drek. I don't blame him."	0.0
"From around the time Europe began fighting World War II	 until the war's end	 Hollywood (with significant prodding from the government) made tons of movies which were designed to try and get young men to enlist in the Army	 by making the life of a serviceman appear ""cool."" This is by far the sloppiest	 implying that the life of a soldier is devoid of work	 you get the best food	 and you get to lie around all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio. I am far too young to have participated in WWII	 but I think that there was more to it than that. There is the barest cat's whisker of a plot	 and a bunch of musical numbers featuring some of the day's leading acts.<br /><br />I think that by 1943	 even the most naive of civvies knew that there was more going on overseas than the wacky hijinks portrayed in this movie. While I am sure that it was meant to be viewed as escapist entertainment	 I can't help but wonder if the family and loved ones of men fighting in the war	 were amused or repulsed by this trivialization of their loved ones' sacrifice."	0.0
"Henry Hathaway was daring	 as well as enthusiastic	 for his love of the people of the early days in US history. However	 to critique historical inaccuracies of his film about Brigham Young and the Mormon people are not necessary or useful in commenting for this film. In my opinion	 Hathaway did superb direction that conveys what a Mormon people were in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints during the time period beginning with the martyrdom of Joseph Smith to the date of film release. In often subtle filming and dialog delivery	 he covered Mormon philosophies and teachings in many of the segments and scenes.<br /><br />I remember watching this movie on many Saturday mornings during my youth in the early 1950's. That was just over 10 years after the films release and before the Los Angeles Temple was completed	 which I watched being constructed and instilled more curious wonder of who Mormons were. I recently purchased this film and will enjoy the following messages that Hathaway interpreted in his film.<br /><br />1. Love for all people	 regardless of their personal beliefs	 2. Charity to those in need or not	 3. Family is high in importance	 4. Listen respectfully and carefully	 because even opposing messages have important points to consider and adopt	 5. Work hard	 both individually and in community	 6. Prepare and store for future days of need	 7. Hope is a binding link to a higher being	 and for our daily lives	 8. And	 that there is a unique quality to any group	 and appreciate those that are identified as beneficial."	1.0
"Robert Altman is my favorite American director. I must admit that I have enjoyed the films that are usually scorned: ""Quintet""	 if only for giving me the pleasure of seeing a grown-up and beautiful Brigitte Fossey	 who was unforgettable as the little girl in ""Forbidden Games""; ""HealtH""	 for having Lauren Bacall	 Carol Burnett	 Alfre Woodard and Glenda Jackson	 all in the same cast; ""Popeye""	 for that splendid and surreal world	 Shelley Duvall's Olive Oyl and the wonderful Malta locations; ""O.C. & Stiggs""	 for its proposal of an anti-""adolescents flick""; ""Beyond Therapy""	 for all its lunacy and for the presence of Genèvieve Page	 who for all her effort to look Parisian chic is taken for a travestite... I have even enjoyed his one-act TV movies	 like ""The Dumb Waiter"" and ""The Laundromat"". When there is not much plot to develop in his films	 you have wonderful performances	 from Burnett	 John Travolta	 Kim Basinger or Jane Curtin. I perceive and enjoy the different approach and description he makes of the many different cultures of the United States. It is a pity that his genius is seldom appreciated	 and that he is always forgotten when the time comes for giving out American prizes and awards. He is not your typical mainstream purveyor of fantasies. He is more of a maverick. So it is not surprising for me to find so many bad comments posted here about ""The Gingerbread Man""	 his most 'mainstream' effort to date and to my knowledge. I did not know there were so many people who thought like Leonard Maltin	 who does not like Altman at all. In this case	 one may dislike ""The Gingerbread Man""	 but for me the reason has more to do with Grisham than with the director-screenwriter. Some of Altman's trademarks are here: improvised dialogue	 great performances	 a funny lawyers' office with typical irreverent receptionist and secretary. While some people find it boring	 I found the first act fascinating	 thanks also for the great cinematography by Changwei Gu	 the man who shot ""Red Sorghum""	 ""Ju Dou"" and ""Farewell My Concubine"". He has a way of showing us the same things we see in other American movies	 but under a different light. Through his ""foreigner's gaze""	 almost everything seems new and different. In this first act	 things were so logical and true! Wait until you get older. You may get in trouble if you fall under the spell of someone younger and beautiful as Embeth Davidtz. I know for myself what I have done fascinated by someone who is younger than I am! Then you have Robert Duvall's repellent	 menacing and mysterious character	 while that Geraldo storm is threatening Savannah. The second act gets a little phony and even funny	 because Altman may have conducted it with a grin. I remember laughing aloud in several instances with his ironic remarks. I think he was applying a bit of Brecht	 distancing us	 preparing us for the third act	 which is plain Hollywood pastiche. Altman does it with expertise. Being a wise man	 and an intelligent director	 luckily he did not fall into the traps of today's action movies. He was directing a tale of lust	 greed and death. I was not disappointed a bit with the movie. If I give it a nine instead of 10	 it is because of Grisham. The American reader has turned him into a best-selling author. So why complain? Maybe we should thank Altman for showing us the seams in his stories	 the dullness	 the flatness and the silliness of them all. However	 he does it with so much gusto and humor	 that I cannot but disagree with the negative comments. For me	 these persons saw another movie... And vice versa."	1.0
"Critically	 people say that Antz is better. Antz is a good film	 but I enjoyed Bug's Life a bit more. I can't remember a Pixar animation	 other than the two Toy Story films	 that I was laughing so hard. The animation is clean	 the story is original and doesn't preach. The voice overs are what make this movie. Dave Foley is an earnest ant that gets himself into trouble a lot. Hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful Kevin Spacey	 as is Haydn Panettiere as Dot . There is also sterling support from Dennis Leary	 David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn	 and I could go on and on. The script is fantastic	 so funny and sometimes even touching. It lacks the social messages of Antz	 but what we have is rock-solid entertainment. 9/10. Bethany Cox"	1.0
"I gave this two stars for the awesome DV shot clarity	 which lends to the cold and dark sterility of its character. That was being generous	 I know.<br /><br />This film fails on all accounts. I can not recommend this	 for it is neither poetic	 nor blunt. Neither dramatic	 nor suspenseful. Neither controversial	 nor ordinary. It is just a wretched piece of trash that no horror or exploit fan can recommend in good faith.<br /><br />Do not watch this	 whoever you are. . .please	 just stay away from this awful product.<br /><br />Thank you."	0.0
"Wilhelm Grimm (Alexander Knox) stands trial for Nazi crimes. Three witnesses give evidence - Father Warecki (Henry Travers)	 Wilhelm's brother Karl (Erik Rolf) and Wilhelm's former lover Marja (Marsha Hunt) - before Wilhelm speaks in his own defense. The film ends after the court sums up....<br /><br />The film is told in three flashback segments as each of the witnesses takes the stand. The story is mostly set in a small Polish village and memorable scenes include the village reaction to the death of Anna (Shirley Mills)	 who Wilhelm is accused of raping; the treatment of the Jewish villagers as they prepare to be moved to concentration camps; and the church service where Willie Grimm (Richard Crane) denounces his Nazi upbringing whilst mourning for his girlfriend Janina (Dorothy Morris)	 Marja's daughter	 after she has been shot at a brothel.<br /><br />Throughout the film	 Knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter	 resentful and evil man. Martha Hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and Henry Travers is also very good in his role as a priest. This film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished."	1.0
"This episode apparently grew out of the cold war. There has been a holocaust but somehow Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson have come through unscathed. It then becomes a battle for turf. She is attracted to him and vice versa	 but the instinct for survival takes over. It's a quiet	 slow moving	 chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust. They come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again. Of course	 the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive. But it still is captivating and interesting. Because she doesn't speak	 we don't know here mind very well	 but in the end we can guess."	1.0
"The over-heated plot of ""Bonjour tristesse"" is taken from a juvenile first novel by Francoise Sagan	 which became a best-seller	 though God knows why. For teenagers wanting to get rid of a potential step-parent it may have a certain appeal. Don't be taken in by the fact that David Niven plays the playboy father and Deborah Kerr the step-mother-in- prospect. Unfortunately	 too much rests on the frail shoulders of Jean Seberg. She's beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that she can strike poses but she can't act. Anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in Otto Preminger's St. Joan -- Seberg's first film -- knows she was incapable at 19 of carrying a film. This movie	 also by Preminger	 fulfills the ""promise"" of the first. It was her second movie; she was now 20. What was Preminger thinking? That Niven and Kerr could compensate for Seberg's lack of acting capacity? Not a chance? Seberg's character is at the center of the story and	 pretty though she is	 convincing though she may be physically as a 17 year old	 she can't meet the emotional demands of the role. I don't know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she did not have an impact on my consciousness in her later pictures. But anyone who thinks this film is better than mediocre needs a taste check. In spite of Niven and Kerr	 this remains a juvenile story executed in juvenile fashion by a beautiful young girl who badly needed acting lessons."	0.0
"I love this movie!!! Purple Rain came out the year I was born and it has had my heart since I can remember. Prince is so tight in this movie. I went to a special showing of Purple Rain last night and it was like a concert i was glad to see some true fans cause this movie is so undervalued	 it is really one of the greatest movies of all time. The music is untouchable. The movie is about ""The Kid""	 played by Prince	 his family is dysfunctional	 his band is the hottest act in town	 and he has his eyes on the Apollonia	 an aspiring singer. There is no question why purple is my favorite color I can thank ""The Kid"" for that. So if you have not seen this then you are need to asap. This is a classic - 4ever!"	1.0
"H.G. Wells in 1936 was past his prime and the books of his that will survive were long gone by. He was coming to the end of his life and he was confronted to his dream gone sour. At the very beginning of the 20th century he defended the idea that the world was doomed because the evolution of species	 natural biology	 on one side	 and Marxism	 market economy on the other side	 were necessarily leading to the victory of the weaker over the stronger due to the simple criterion of number. The weaker were the mass of humanity and the stronger were the minority elite. He defended then a strict eugenic policy with the elimination of all those who were in a way or another weakening the human race. First of all the non-Caucasian	 with the only exception of the Jews who would disappear thanks to mixed marriages. Then	 within the Caucasian community all those who were not healthy	 the alcoholics	 the mentally disabled	 all those who were genetically disabled	 etc. That was not Hitler. That was H.G. Wells and that was not after the first world war. That was more than ten years before. And twenty years before the first world war he had published The Time Machine that defended the idea that the human ""race""	 left to its own means and due to the vaster cosmological evolution of life on earth	 would see the differentiation of the human ""race"" into two ""species"": the working class would become a subterranean laborious species and the bourgeoisie would become an idle surface species. The point was in the novel that the surface sophisticated and weak idle species was the prey of the other species who were the predators. Wells was convinced humanity was in danger and politicians were supposed to stop this evolution by imposing a strict eugenic policy. The first countries to follow this injunction were the Scandinavian countries who were also the last to drop it only very recently for some of them. The film here proposes a vision of 2036 with a world government that is absolutely dictatorial in the fact that there is no election	 no parliament	 no really democratic institution	 only peace imposed by military conquest	 and the government is dominated by one man or at the most one man and his few councilors. And in that future world all	 absolutely all human beings are Caucasians. Wells was able to imagine humanity being completely white by 2036. Amazing. Wells envisaged some kind of a rebellion but that would be short lived and lead to nothing at all. The last sentences are the vision of this white civilization conquering the whole universe when contemplating the sky and its stars and planets. Frightening. And that was produced in 1936. All the more frightening since nowhere the slightest mention of Hitlerism	 fascism	 Japanese imperialism or Stalinism can be found. But it is essential to have that film in a good restored edition because it is crucial to have a full vision of H.G. Wells. We are obviously very far away from the Brave New World of absolute ""democratic"" social selection	 or the Animal Farm of the dictatorship of the porcine proletariat	 or the 1984 of the abstract mediatic dictatorship of Big Brother. This vision is at least just as much frightening as the three others. And I only want to compare Wells with the British science fiction writers of his days. It would be unfair to go beyond. This reveals that in England in these first three decades of the 20th century there was a tremendous fear among intellectuals: the fear that the future would only be somber	 bleak and in the form of an impasse of some kind.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU	 University Paris Dauphine	 University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"	1.0

I have seen it four times so far and I still haven't made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film. That is all I am going to say because if you have not seen this film	 then stop reading right now.<br /><br />If you are still reading then I am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think.<br /><br />I remember my Grade 11 English teacher quite well. His name was Mr. Krisak. To me	 he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you weren't all too keen on. If we didn't like Shakespeare	 then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it. Our class room was never a room	 it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time. This was his own indelible way of branding something into our sponge-like minds. <br /><br />I begin this review of Vanilla Sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind	 like the phone number of a long lost best friend	 and it finally made some sense to me after watching The Matrix. Now if I didn't know better	 I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher Mr. Krisak.

But that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable. <br /><br />He had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real. Show me how you can tell that you are real. This got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that I'm sure you can imagine. Everything from pain	 to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real. After every scenario that we gave him	 he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless.<br /><br />""What if you are nothing but someone else's dream?""<br /><br />What if you were someone else's dream? What a messed up question that is. This was a question/scenario posed to us about 15 years ago	 before the astronomical use of the Internet and rapid advancement of computers. How possible could it seem back then? But if you look at today's technology	 now ask yourself	 what it you were a part of someone else's dream.<br /><br />Another brilliant but surreal film this year	 David Lynch's Mulholland Drive explored similar areas. But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to. In short this is one film that will literally (if you let it) blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you.<br /><br />Open your Eyes.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays David Aames	 a young	 hot shot	 righteous	 full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines. He inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy	 his board of governers	 the Seven Dwarfs	 think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them. <br /><br />Early in the film we meet one of David's gorgeous toys named Julie Gianni	 played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by Cameron Diaz. David and Julie play a good game	 both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous	 committed relationship. This is the type of relationship commensurate with David's other flings he's had in the sexual prime of his life. And although both talk a good game	 we can tell that only one is really telling the truth. <br /><br />Next we meet Brian Shelby	 played with a stroke of genius by Kevin Smith's good buddy Jason Lee. Brian is writing a book that David is going to publish but they are also very good friends. This is something that David has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film. Brian has one famous line that he keeps telling David over and over again. And that is "" the sweet ain't so sweet without the bitter."" He goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or two.<br /><br />At David's huge birthday bash	 (so huge that the likes of Steven Spielberg wish him a happy birthday) Brian enters with his date	 Sofia Sorrano	 played of course by Penelope Cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress. This is a bash by invite only and at first David and Sofia seem intrigued with one another. And in typical David fashion	 despite his best friend being there	 he begins to flirt with Sofia. To complicate things	 Julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on David. David then spends the night with Sofia	 but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another. There is no hanky panky. The next day	 as David is leaving Sofia's apartment	 he is greeted by Julie	 who offers him a ride and from there.......well	 I think we have all seen the commercials.<br /><br />That is all I will really say about the plot	 because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception. We are introduced to a character played by Kurt Russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze. There is a subtext of death and possible panacea-like cure-alls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life. This is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us	 but it doesn't end there.<br /><br />Like many movies seem to thrive on today	 this film has a secret. Sixth Sense may have began this craze	 but look even further back and you can maybe thank Angel Heart for starting the craze. Regardless of how it originated	 Vanilla Sky has one of it's own surreptitious gut busters. And what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through. I have seen this film four times and every time it has been because I want to see if there is something more I can pick up	 something more I can understand. To be able to work your mind in the theater	 to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film. All of the ersatz so called ""Best Pictures of the year"" have been good but nothing spectacular. They lack substance. A Beautiful Mind was intriguing but flat	 The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but uneven. Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it. I know this film has received mixed reviews but I just think that those who don't like it don't quite understand it. <br /><br />This is what film making is supposed to be like. This is what a film is supposed to do to you. It is supposed to make you feel something. Most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces. This one isn't.<br /><br />10 out of 10 The best film of the year. I would love to see this get nominated for best picture and I would love to see Cruz up for best Actress	 Diaz for best supporting	 Cruise for best actor and Jason Mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor. Cameron Crowe should there as well. None of this may come to pass	 and that is a shame. This is one film that should not be missed. <br /><br />And on a final note	 I am quite sure Mr. Krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question. Can you prove you are real? Or are we just a figment of someone's imagination? Are we artificially transplanted for someone else's bemusement? This is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers. And I'm sure that is just fine with him.<br /><br />Open Your Eyes"	1.0
"Need a lesson in pure	 abject failure?? Look no further than ""Wizards of the Lost Kingdom""	 an abysmal	 dirt-poor	 disgrace of a flick. As we all know	 decent moovies tend to sprout horrible	 horrible offspring: ""Halloween"" begat many	 many bad 80's slasher flicks; ""Mad Max"" begat many	 many bad 80's ""futuristic wasteland fantasy"" flicks; and ""Conan the Barbarian"" begat a whole slew of terrible	 horrible	 incredibly bad 80's sword-and-sorcery flicks. ""Wizards of the Lost Kingdom"" scrapes the bottom of that 80's barrel	 in a way that's truly insulting to barrels. A young runt named Simon recaptured his ""good kingdom"" from an evil sorcerer with the help of a mangy rug	 a garden gnome	 a topless bimbo mermaid	 and a tired-looking	 pudgy Bo Svenson. Svenson(""North Dallas Forty""	 ""Inglorious Bastards""	 ""Delta Force"")	 a long-time b-moovie muscleman	 looks barely able to swing his aluminum foil sword. However	 he manages to defeat the forces of evil	 which consist of the evil sorcerer	 ""Shurka""	 and his army of badly costumed monsters	 giants	 and midgets. At one point	 a paper mache bat on a string attacks	 but is eaten by a 1/2 hidden sock puppet	 pitifully presented as some sort of dragon. The beginning of the film consists of what can only politely be described as bits of scenes scooped up from the cutting-room floor of udder bad moovies	 stitched together in the vain hope of setting the scene for the film	 and over-earnestly narrated by some guy who never appears again. Words cannot properly convey the jaw-dropping cheapness of this film; the producers probably spent moore moolah feeding Svenson's ever expanding gullet than on the cheesy fx of this flick. And we're talkin' Brie here	 folks... :=8P Director Hector Olivera(""Barbarian Queen"") presents this mish-mash in a hopelessly confused	 confuddled	 and cliched manner	 destroying any possible hint of clear	 linear storytelling. The acting is dreadful	 the production levels below shoe-string	 and the plot is one tired cliche after another paraded before our weary eyes. That they actually made a sequel(!!!) makes the MooCow's brain whirl. James Horner's(""Braveheart""	 ""Titanic""	""The Rock"") cheesy moosic from ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" was lifted	 screaming and kicking	 and mercilessly grafted onto this turkey - bet this one doesn't pop up on his resume. Folks	 you gotta see this to believe it. The MooCow says as a cheapo rent when there is NOTHING else to watch	 well	 it's moore fun than watching dust bunnies mate. Barely. :=8P"	0.0
"Grey Gardens was enthralling and crazy and you just couldn't really look away. It was so strange	 and funny and sad and sick and .. really no words can describe. The move Grey Gardens is beyond bizarre. I found out about this film reading my Uncle John's Great Big Bathroom Reader	 by the Bathroom Reader's Institute and it was well worth the rental and bump to the top of my movie watching queue. This movie is about the nuttiest most eccentric people that may have ever been filmed. One should watch it for their favorite Edie outfits	 which I am sure include curtains. When I get old I almost wish to be just like Big Edie	 thumbing my nose at normalcy and society."	1.0
"I wasn't sure when I heard about this coming out. I was thinking how dumb is Disney getting. I was wrong. I found it to be very good. I mean it's not The Lion King but it's cool to see another side from a certain point. It was very funny. Also it wasn't one of those corny disney sequels were the animation sucks	 it was just like The Lion King animation. The only thing that eritated me was the whole movie theater thing through out the movie. Not to give anything way but you'll know what I am talking about. I also fun that it was cool to have most of the cast from the original to return. It was a very good movie over all."	1.0
"This is a nice little movie with a nice story	 that plays the most important role in the entire movie.<br /><br />It's a quite intriguing dramatic story	 with also romance present in it. The story is being told slowly but this works out all too well for its build up. The characters are nice and portrayed nicely by its actors. Normally I'm not a too big fan of the Asian acting style but the acting in this movie was simply good.<br /><br />Of course the movie is quite different in its approach and style from other genre movies	 produced in the west. In a way this movie is more advanced already with its approach than the western movies made during the same era.<br /><br />I only wished the movie its visual style would had been a bit better. For a movie that is considered a kind of an art-house movie this movie is certainly lacking in some well looking sequences. This was obviously a quite cheap movie to make and it got made quite generically. Not that this is a bad thing	 it just prevent this movie from truly distinct itself and raising itself above the genre.<br /><br />But oh well	 this movie is all about its well constructed story and characters that are in it. In that regard this movie most certainly does not disappoint.<br /><br />8/10"	1.0
"Being a fan of Andy Goldsworthy's art for a while now	 and owning some of his books	 I had some expectations of what I would see. What I got was something completely satisfying	 and quite a bit more than I expected. Being an artist myself (I work in clay)	 finding inspiration within our surroundings to make good art is imperative	 and it is something Andy Goldsworthy has mastered. Following him over the course of a year	 the director captures the spontaneous energy	 skill	 and devotion to the artists connection with nature with dratic inspiring flair. The music set to the film is embracing and intoxicating. If you are an artist in need of inspiration	 or anyone else in need of an uplifting experience	 then SEE THIS MOVIE. I for one am glad to know that Andy is somewhere out there. Creating	 dancing	 wrestling with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful."	1.0
"Dear God! I kept waiting for this movie to ""get started""... then I waited for it to redeem itself... and when it did neither	 I just sat there	 dumbfounded that: 1) it could possibly be this bad	 and 2) that I had just wasted a couple of hours on just sheer stupidity. I had faith that Drew couldn't possibly have made this bad of a movie... and boy	 did I ever lose my faith! Don't bother with this one! Drew tried	 but the movie was poorly written	 poorly acted	 and just poorly conceived! I can't believe a script this bad ever got funded! It had a million chances to actually do something with the idea	 (the word ""concept"" is too big for this movie to even qualify for!) and it STILL didn't go anyplace! Its just pitiful! Where the other reviewer got the idea that it wasn't the worst	 baffles me! Because believe me	 if it got any worse I'd have slit my wrists before finishing it!"	0.0
"""Metamorphosis"" hold a tiny bit of cult-value	 simply because it was written and directed by George Eastman. This Italian bloke is more or less the personification of male sleaze and starred in pretty much every rancid Joe D'Amato production during the late 70's/early 80's. Wouldn't it be interesting for avid Euro-cult purchasers to own the only movie directed by the guy who walked around bare-butted in ""Erotic Nights of the Living Dead"" all the time? I thought so! Now	 unlike the movies he starred in	 Eastman's own ""Metamorphosis"" is kind of disappointing in the gore & sleaze departments. There are a handful of nasty murders	 cheesy monster effects and naked female bodies (a guest appearance by sleaze-queen Laura Gemser!) on display	 but it's mainly a talkative movie. The handsome & eloquent Dr. Houseman is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough with his research on human DNA codes when suddenly the university he works for threatens to cancel his funds. He developed a theory to decode genes and block the human ageing process	 but if he doesn't come up with detailed reports any time soon	 his research will be stopped. So Dr. Houseman does what any intelligent scientist would do and injects the untested serum into his own veins. Needless to say (and like the title implies)	 he slowly turns into murderous monster that actually ages much quicker! In other words	 his research sucked! Like the other reviewers already mentioned	 this movie ""borrows"" a lot of ideas from David Cronenberg's ""The Fly""  the dramatic romance sub plot included - but doesn't add any originality from its own. The big difference is that you constantly feel connected with Jeff Goldblum's character in ""The Fly""	 whereas Dr. Houseman becomes just another monster that needs to be destroyed as fast as possible. The rapid-ageing-syndrome aspect also reminded me of Ruggero Deodato's sadly underrated giallo ""Phantom of Death""	 only the protagonist in that film inherited the disease and didn't inflict it on himself. The physical deterioration of the carriers is very similar in both films	 though. Few scares or excitement to discover here	 instead the movie features loads of bad acting	 poor lighting	 lousy editing and a completely retarded climax to boot. Feel free to skip this one."	0.0
"This is the best made-for-TV movie of all-time! Am I saying this because I'm a huge Silverstone fan? Partially	 but even without her	 I'd still see it. I'm a fan of serial killer genre films	 and believe this to be a great entry in that category. Also	 Mary Giordano easily ranks among Alicia's top five character creations. Totally memorable - like she really exists. I'd have her on my side	 too	 if there was a mystery to be solved. She plays the character	 like she does with her real life	 with complete confidence in everything she does. Seems sweet	 honest	 nice...just like she is in real life. So is that acting? Yes	 indeed	 she's sort of a rebel once again. This time she's not bad	 she's too good and a bit afraid to do things that seem above the law. But she doesn't do things the normal teenager would do. Instead	 she spends her time reading detective mags and solves crimes. A cliche abounds: she's sort of avenging her father's death	 in a different way than vigilante-style. At the time	 Alicia seemed to be playing the same characters: rebellious	 seductive	 without a parent	 a loner. This happens here	 too	 but she's a bit nerdy this time around. That doesn't matter; she's still cool as a nerd. Check this out soon	 or else Giordano will be investigating why you haven't..."	1.0
"Along with 2 days in the Valley	 I think this is one of worst movies I've ever seen. Just another of the long line of Tarantino rip-offs that have emerged since Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere the movie creates is amusing for the first five minutes	 but then the film makers make the unforgivable mistake of allowing unnecessary and grotesque violence to up the ""hip"" quotient. You're better off skipping this one."	0.0

"I guess that this movie is based on some kind of a true story.... It's about two young girls who molest a grown man for 48hrs.; I don't see where the terror comes into play here.... There are some ""weird' and ""surreal"" sequences in the movie. And the two girls (Sandra Locke and...ah...oh well) play the roll of two psycho-man haters to the hilt...they do a pretty good job (although some of it is just a tad over the top). The movie's not good	 and it's not horrible; it's just really really dated! I mean this thing is dripping with the 70's....

"I normally do not take the time to make comments that few people will read	 about movies few will see. However	 in this case	 I feel I must warn all those who might consider wasting time on it. I just finished watching it only five minutes ago. This is	 quite simply	 one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life. The acting is horrible	 a plot is nonexistent	 and production values are poverty level at best. I know that even a low budget movie can be great	 but not this one. There is only thing that could have saved this movie for any horror fan's purposes--more on-screen gore and slashing! The grand total of three times that this occurs is off-screen. While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens--especially the end scene--there is simply not enough of it. The movie is just too long for it's minimal content	 too dialogue heavy	 and consequently almost impossible to watch. What happens? To put it all in a nutshell with room to spare	 three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered. Their car	 of course	 breaks down	 and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people--one of whom is the psychotic killer. All three are eventually murdered	 one by one	 off-screen	 after what seems like an eternity of boring	 slow-paced nonsense. As I said	 the only things worth watching even once are the murders. Please don't buy it or rent it just for that	 and don't be fooled like I was by the misleading box art and movie description. Save your money and your time."	0.0
"This is possibly the best short crime drama I've ever seen. The acting is superb especially Amanda Burton who's character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some...She does an amazing job balancing Rachels/Carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who's lost a child	 its so believable that it feels more like a real life story then a drama. The other actors are of course great too which they usually are in British TV/Film. The ending	which I'm not going to give away	is fantastic mainly because you don't really get one... (you'll get what I mean after you've seen it) This is well worth buying and seeing over and over again and if you're not touched by this you're one cold hearted person."	1.0
"Spoilers.<br /><br />First off	 nothing really happened in this movie	 other than a woman bleeding inexplicably. Second	 it wasn't scary. Third	 it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever. Let me elaborate. The sound was edited by either Beavis or Butthead  I'm not sure which	 so let's just go with Beavis. The movie gradually gets more and more quiet and the people mumble and mutter	 forcing you to turn up the volume (I watched this at home). Then Beavis blasts some really loud sounds with supposedly scary/shocking images	 forcing you to quickly lower the volume again. This occurs many times until	 mercifully	 the movie ends. I can picture Beavis laughing vulgarly from behind the two-way mirror while watching the test group franticly reaching for the remote each time. If you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after they fall asleep	 this one is a big mistake. But then it's a big mistake anyway. Here's a thought  if you're going to make a horror movie	 at least add a gratuitous beheading	 a 19-year-old blond girl who screams at the top of her lungs just before she can take off her sweater	 the shadow on the wall of someone being eaten alive just out of the camera range	 a cat being thrown at the camera to scare the audience	 some drifty weirdo with a maniacal laugh	 or a monster who looks like a stage hand covered in aluminum foil (a la TV's Lost in Space). These people didn't even try to scare me. They just wanted to hurt my ears."	0.0
I'm surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars.<br /><br />But they just don't understand the movie.<br /><br />The story is about growing up in a difficult situation.<br /><br />There is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your grandchildren.<br /><br />And there's good reason why so many critics like this movie.<br /><br />And the reason is because they understand the movie.<br /><br />I feel sorry for the low scores given by some people.<br /><br />I wish I could just write a brief summary of a movie but IMDb requires you to write 10 lines.<br /><br />I frankly don't have anything else to say.	1.0
"I originally caught this back in 1996 in its one week run at a movie theatre. I was under impressed by it and my feelings haven't much changed.<br /><br />Documentary about the infamous Edward D. Wood Jr. covering his life and movies. There are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. They include: Vampira	 Dolores Fuller	 Bela Lugosi Jr.	 Loretta King	 Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations. It is interesting (somewhat) but was this really needed? I've seen all of Wood's films and they're just terrible. Wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out. I wouldn't say he was the worst director ever but he's down there. Do we really need a docu on a very mediocre film maker? I do like the fact that they didn't try to make Wood out to be some sort of saint. More than a few of those interviewed (especially Lugosi Jr.) pretty much hated the man and it comes through loud and clear. Also they totally ignore his films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s. Still it's of interest if you're a Wood fan. The best interviews are with Vampira (who tears Wood apart) and Dolores Fuller (a long time girlfriend)."	1.0
"This film's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the DVD. However	 the resulting movie is absolutely dire! Admittedly	 this is not the worst film ever made	 or the worst film this year	 but it came damn close!<br /><br />The main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be: comedy	 adult drama	 thriller	 teen-porn? The story is interesting	 as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides	 but the film is a mess. What starts out as a mildly interesting ""comedy"" (a word I use in the loosest possible terms)	 then goes totally in reverse	 and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better	 and Ben Chaplin is wasted! As are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel	 whom I can only presume did this for the money.<br /><br />This is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect. It's not funny	 it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did	 and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty. A film to be avoided	 unless you absolutely have to see Kidman or Chaplin in every one of their films!"	0.0
"> you are warned this is a spoiler! > This movie is so bad that i doubt i can write enough lines. great direction the shots were well thought out. the actors were very good particularly Richard pryor tho i would have liked to have seen more of him. Madeline Kahn and john houseman were classic. Dudley More god bless him could have done better. John Ritter again i would have liked to see more of him. In my opinion this failure is due totally to writer failure. Maybe the producer could have pulled the plug once he saw what he was creating. Its just too bad that so much money went into this boiler	when with a little change here and there would in my opinion fixed it.They must have paid the writers standard rates.

"Personally	 I enjoyed Cut thouroughly. It was the first time I've seen a theatrically release Australian slasher flick. A genre normally restricted to the mainstream hollywood films.<br /><br />With all the usual cooky comedies and dramas coming out of Australia I loved being able to see a homegrown horror movie that wasn't a rip off of anything. I didn't even think it was really a spoof of other movies. It was a supernaturally theme horror like Nightmare on Elm Street	 not Scream or I know What You Did Last Summer and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief. I think it's about time Australian films tried to get more into the mainstream genres.<br /><br />Cut was original	 scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun. I'd give it seven out of ten and wouldn't treat it as anything serious. It did what I expected it to do	 entertain and scare me enough times to be satisfying. I enjoyed it."	1.0
"I was expecting a little something from ""K-911""	 I mean it did look like a cute movie that I could get into. I always did love the dog comedy movies. But it looked like it was supposed to be Jame's movie	 not Jerry Lee's. The plot was pretty lame and the two love interests really didn't have chemistry to begin with. Not to mention that James seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn't going in that direction. James just really ticked me off for more than half the film. The dogs were the true stars and that's pretty sad that they out shined the actors.<br /><br />So	 I'm glad it's not just me on IMDb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie. But hopefully	 James will realize it was his brother Jim who was the talented one	 no offense	 but not everyone can be their star sibling.

"I love this movie. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed.<br /><br />It's true that Frank Sinatra does not get a chance to sing as much in this movie but it's also nice that it's not just another Frank Sinatra movie where it's mostly him doing the singing.<br /><br />I actually thought it was better to use Marlon Brando's own voice as he has the voice that fits and I could not see someone with this great voice pulling off the gangster feel of his voice.<br /><br />Stubby Kaye's ""Sit Down	 You're Rockin' the Boat"" is a foot-tappin'	 sing-a-long that I just love. He is a hard act to follow with his version and I still like his the best.<br /><br />Vivian Blaine is just excellent in this part and ""Adelaide's Lament"" is my favorite of her songs.<br /><br />I really thought Jean Simmons was perfect for this part. Maybe I would not have first considered her but after seeing her in the part	 it made sense.<br /><br />Michael Kidd's choreography is timeless. If it were being re staged in the year 2008	 I would not change a thing.<br /><br />I find that many times something is lost from the stage version to the movie version but this kept the feel of the stage	 even though it was on film.<br /><br />I thought the movie was well cast.

"(Only minor spoilers except as noted).<br /><br />I've enjoyed a lot of Spanish cinema recently; both the actual Spanish cinema of people like Almodovar	 and the Latin American cinema of directors like del Toro	 whose superb ""Devil's Backbone""	 set in Civil War Spain	 was the finest horror film of the last decade. It's no surprise	 then	 that this film is both well-made	 well-acted	 and manages to sustain that distinctively different Spanish atmosphere. But it's also as nasty and pointless a film as one could hope not to have to see.<br /><br />What actually is the purpose of all this? We have no real idea what caused the creepy central character to embark on his killing spree	 despite the fact that large amounts of narrative voice-over are drawn directly from his own narcissistic journal. In a routinely unpleasant opening sequence	 set more than a decade earlier	 we see the central character killing his girlfriend in a rage of jealousy and control-freakery ("" if I can't have you nobody can .""). Oddly enough	 that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film	 but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree	 which appears completely different in both motivation and execution. What happened to him in jail to cause this change? We have no idea	 though we do later discover	 as an absurd sort of afterthought	 that he obtained a law degree while imprisoned.<br /><br />In Britain	 in several of our notorious ""serial killer"" or ""sex killer"" cases	 the terrible question arises; what about the wife? Did she know	 or suspect what was going on? This is a question that this film could have asked	 and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters. But banally	 the answer to the question is quite clearly: ""No	 she didn't"". Even when a dramatic opportunity like this is presented on a plate	 the film still manages to bungle it. All we actually get	 sketched perfunctorily out at the end	 is her slightly amoral preparedness to cash in on the proceeds after the event. Compare this to the awful revelatory moment in Ten Rillington Place	 where Christie's wife says ""you know what I mean ."" thereby sealing her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into unimaginable chasms of suppressed knowledge and horror.<br /><br />(Major spoiler in this paragraph). In the meantime	 we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who comprehensively outwits the police	 thereby securing the briefest of incarcerations in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again. How exactly did he achieve this? The plot gets extremely sketchy at this point; something to do with deliberately leaving certain clues for the police; but how this all works or why	 or how the subsequent court case actually proceeds	 remains a mystery.<br /><br />I actually don't believe serial killers are like this. The Silence of the Lambs may be comic book stuff	 but  Lecter aside  it gets its serial killers right. They are deeply disturbed	 deeply dysfunctional	 deeply inadequate people; not the creepily charming mastermind presented here (closely related to the equally implausible suave killer of The Last Horror Movie	 or indeed even Man Bites Dog	 though it appears not to have been noticed that that was a satire).<br /><br />This film has little suspense	 and bungles what little intrigue the plot might have generated. It has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers	 either generally	 or in the specific cultural milieu of Spain. This is nothing more than a poorly plotted excuse to show some pretty misogynistic violence to women. And oddly	 what makes that violence even more repulsive is a certain prissy failure of nerve even in how it is presented. The soft core character of what is actually shown just makes it seem even more repellently titillatory. Just one explicit shot	 properly timed	 would have been infinitely more shocking	 and would have rendered all the rest completely unnecessary	 freeing up more film time to flesh out the gaping holes in plot and characterisation. Instead we just get endless shots of young women vulnerably spreadeagled on a table in their pretty but slightly revealing underwear. Very	 very creepy. I'm sorry to be rude; I love horror films	 and can tolerate even the most extreme	 to the extent even of worrying my partner. But I think anyone who finds this film good	 or interesting	 even I'd find myself edging away from. The purpose of a horror film is to scare you; this is just lascivious.<br /><br />It leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed. I have to give this film more than one star just because it's competently executed	 but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been made."	0.0
"Wow	 alot of reviews for the Devils Experiment are here. Wonderful. My name is Steve and I run Unearthed Films. We just started releasing the Guinea Pig films on DVD for North America. Now before you ask why am I writing a review? Instead ask why some people bash it. I'm writing this review because I love the Guinea Pig films. Why do I love em	 it's because they go for the throat and they don't let go. I've seen it all. Almost every horror film known to man	 Argento	 Fulci	 Bava	 Buttgereit. from every underground cult sensation to every Hollywood blockbuster. I've seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the Guinea Pig films. Why because it doesn't try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the 1st place. This review is for the Devils Experiment. I find it devoid of story which is fine by me. Why do I watch horror films? So I can see blood and gore and the torture of people. The Devils Experiment not only delivers but that's all it is. Pure unadulterated violence. Yeah I like a story but sometimes I just want the gore and the Devils Experiment delivers ten fold. Why do people bash it. Cause they like a story	 so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story. It make em feel better about themselves. We all want blood and gore. It's just really hard to justify it if it's not wrapped around a story. The Guinea Pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world. Maybe I shouldn't have written this review but then again maybe I should. My view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it's not. I've always told people to find them and to watch them way before I started Unearthed Films. Sure it's exploitive and over the top but isn't that why we watch horror films in the 1st place. The Devils Experiment is NOT for everybody. It's for thrill seekers and gorehounds only. If you think Jason movies and Freddy Krueger movies are awesome then stick to those. But if your on the next level and have seen it all then the Devils Experiment is for you. There is a reason why they haven't been released for over 17 years. They are wrong	 disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom	 unless she is totally cool. Good luck	 enjoy and never stop living your life."	1.0
"I'm totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum	 and many of the reviews. I think Tony Scott made a good movie here. Yes	 it is highly stylized	 flashy and over the top	 but it is very entertaining. I'm glad at least Ebert and Roeper agrees with me :) <br /><br />This movie may not be for anyone	 but if you like over-the-top	 dark humor	 cool action and dialog	 you should see it. <br /><br />I've previously seen Scott's Man on Fire	 Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State - all good movies	 but I like this one more. It's like a roller-coaster ride	 with great soundtrack selections	 visual styles and in a time when all movies seem to be pg13	 it is nice to see that someone isn't afraid of showing nudity	 gory violence	 and have explicit dialog.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that Keira is super-hot	 and even shows nipples in this one	 either..."	1.0
"I really can say I felt the movie in its right essence where the mind games from dreamy reality enter into the surreal aspect of future faced by Tom Cruise. I didn't cared much about Tom Cruise's acting prowess but I must say that he seems to impress at every point in the movie...not simply due to an engaging storyline but also due to his self being imparted to the lead character....they merge and then speak and its beautiful. However I must say this movie doesn't come under the ""average flick of weekend"" which you pick at random and watch gleefully; It carries strong sentiments and characters so don't wash this one down with your beer and pop-corns. It certainly needs more than that."	1.0
"At the beginning we get to see the start of a secret council of some sorts. It all looks very promising from the get go. With some supernatural elements thrown in	 the mystery gets more interesting by the minute. The main character who seems like a good bloke gets into trouble because of his claim for money he is entitled to (temptation) and other factors. You really empathize with the guy and you want to know what exactly is going on. Normally a person in his situation would have several options. Somehow he does not have those options. In this movie there only seems to be one solution even when it is clear it is not his fault. Out of the blue he encounters characters who talk about church	prayer and God. And they provide the answer for his problem. It should be obvious at a point in the movie what this solution is. Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message. Since it always is helpful. But was it really necessary to disguise this message. This religious element actually ruined the viewing experience for me. While the message is good	it's simplicity can't escape the fact that in real life more needs to happen to resolve issues presented in this movie. The mystery that is presented to us never gets solved. In stead you are forced to deal with another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot. Don't get fooled because of Malcolm Mcdowell. The once brilliant actor is adequate	but if you watch closely you will see that he is not serious at all. He really must be desperate for money. Otherwise what would posses an actor of his caliber to act in a movie like this."	0.0
I thought this was a quiet good movie. It was fun to watch it. What I liked best where the 'Outtakes' at the end of the movie. They were GREAT.	1.0
"A novel by Remarque. A cast that looks great on paper. A left-wing refugee struggling to remain in Paris between the wars. A Gestapo officer undercover.<br /><br />It's a pity there's no synergy here. The bits and pieces never coalesce.<br /><br />Stories about left-wing refugees in France don't have to be this dull. Read Arthur Koestler's memoir ""Scum of the Earth"" (if you can find it). Or his chilling ""Dialogue With Death"" (ditto).<br /><br />To me	 the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental details.<br /><br />The leads spend a lot of time drinking calvados	 the Norman apple brandy. I welcome any prompting to have a nip of calvados myself. It certainly made this film appear to pass more quickly. But	 according to the film	 it's only sold in cheap	 low-class saloons. Vive le tabac parisien! That's what I say. References to intoxicating liquors do abound here; that would seem to be a preoccupation of the scenarists.<br /><br />I enjoy films set in France because it can be amusing waiting for the inevitable full-size alcohol ad to pop up on a wall in the background. I wasn't disappointed. This time it was for Byrrh	 a very unusual choice. This film would rate a 10 if only we were judging it on the refinement of its booze murals.<br /><br />The film's indifferent score is by Louis Gruenberg. Gruenberg is best known -- if you can call it that -- for his opera ""The Emperor Jones""	 based on the O'Neill play. It premièred at roughly the same time as the film version starring Paul Robeson. The opera survives today in a recording or two by Lawrence Tibbett. It should surface again soon though; they're running out of potentially marketable operas to revive.<br /><br />Opera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since Charles Boyer's character operates under his ""Czech"" aliases. Two of them are ""Wozzeck"" and ""Gunther""	 both prominent roles in German opera. Is that just coincidence?<br /><br />Name-dropping just seems to be part of this film. Notice that they call up ""Himmelstoss"" on the phone. Himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters in Remarque's earlier ""All Quiet on the Western Front"".<br /><br />Well	 the in-jokes are all in place; guess there wasn't time to develop any drama."	0.0
"I recently purchased the complete American Gothic series on DVD and it lived up to my memories of it. I was very grateful to be able to view for the first time episodes that were never televised. I loved ""Ring of Fire"" in particular of the stories I hadn't seen the first time around.<br /><br />Gary Cole is fantastic as ""evil	 sexy"" Lucas Buck. Lucas Black as Caleb is also a superb player. I thought Brenda Bakke as Selena Coombs was also superb in her portrayal. In fact	 the whole cast was fantastically talented and had great chemistry with each other.<br /><br />It's a shame the series was screwed by the network (in collusion with a burgeoning group of censors) because it was truly designed for adult viewing. A mixture of comedy	 tragedy	 farce	 satire	 Gothic romance and horror genres	 it offered brilliant characterizations supported by acting at the genius level.<br /><br />I had the most tremendous lust for the devil for once in my life. Long live Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck)	 the most luscious ""fallen angel"" ever."	1.0
"This work is striking in its accurate depiction of teenage life at the time of its execution. Though this is a broad generalization	 parents of that time were too self-absorbed to be real parents	 and those who were home tended to be far too distracted from the real issues	 where their children were concerned. <br /><br />This film teaches us how to let go	 even when it is painful	 and does so with a sweet	 melancholy	 but informed style whereby Foster talks philosophically about feeling the pain of life. I loved that scene. It was my favorite scene in the movie	 actually.<br /><br />The transition from funeral to wedding was meant to show that life does go on	 and so must we. Baio's skateboarding through a pack of goons and outrunning them was meant to show us that the troubled times will pass	 and we are meant to get through them	 to better times.<br /><br />The whole metaphor of ""moving on	"" and the procession of life	 is present throughout the film	 and serves to give us hope	 in the end.<br /><br />I like this movie	 though I do not watch it often	 as it tends to make me melancholy.<br /><br />It shouldn't be viewed by young children	 and probably only those raised in the 1970's-80's would want to.<br /><br />It rates a 7.4/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :."	1.0
"Wow! I loved this movie and LOVE Judy Marte!! This girl isn't just an awesome pretty face	 she's funny and really really talented!! She made me laugh many times just by being very naturally rough with Victor who was desperately hitting on her!

Very refreshing! It's true	 nice	 funny	 well filmed	 it got it all : good story	 good actors	 good film direction!<br /><br />If you like simple	 slow paced	 real life	 urban movies	 like maybe Jersey Girl from Kevin Smith	 you'll love Victor Vargas!

"Watching this movie again really brought back some great childhood memories . I'm 34 now	 have not seen it since I was 12-14. I had almost forgotten about this movie	 but when I watched it again recently	 some scenes literally brought a tear to my eye! That little robot ""Jinx""(friends for ever!). It was just like revisiting my childhood. It was an absolutely amazing experience for me. I will always cherish this movie for that reason. I hope some of you readers can relate to my experience	 not for this particular movie	 but any movie you have not seen in a long while. Very nostalgic...<br /><br />-Thanks for reading"	1.0
"Well	 maybe I'm just having a bad run with Hindi movies lately. I asked the video store guy for Apharan (Prakash Jha) but being a new release	 wasn't available yet. So I had to settle for this one. It turned out to be the stupidest Hindi movie I've seen (and I've seen quite a few). No wonder BOllywood is the laughing stock of the whole world! If IMDb had negative ratings	 I would give Garam Masala a -10.<br /><br />I remember seeing a TV show about the jazzy premiere they had for its release in Mumbai. All the usual celebs and their sideys showed up. For some strange reason	 people expect good stuff from Piyadarashan. I did not like Hulchul	 Hungama	 or his other films. Hulchul	 probably dubbed from Tamil or Telugu	 came across as very loud	 in-your-face fare that again didn't make much sense except in a Bollywood flick. This latest piece of utter CXXP proved that this guy has NO BRAINS. Who made him a director	 even a Bollywood director at that??? <br /><br />Anyhow	 to the film now. What starts off as a romantic escapade turns into a non-sensical woman-hunt. Two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment (isn't it similar to No Entry where the 2 dudes work for a gossip magazine and share an office? Jezuz Christ	 now they're copying their own stories!) Well anyways	 there's some cook or chef that tries to help one of the dodos in his quest for multi-lateral love (aka multi-tasking + multi-timing). What happened in the end	 I've no idea. I switched off mid-way. What ridiculous junk. I can't believe they even released it. And how sadistic to wallow in their own filth! For which audience did they make it - the poor illiterate Indian masses (700 Mil at last count) or the well-heeled NRI desis staying in Phoren? Either ways it doesn't matter. Neither group has any clue what makes a good movie and probably deserves such god-awful stuff.<br /><br />Its a short review because there's nothing to write about but the usual bag of F-grade garbage. Bollywood should change its name to Follywood. And yes	 this review is much better than the movie itself."	0.0
"If this film strikes you (as it did us and	 apparently	 others departing the theater) as disappointingly thin	 it may be because the subject herself is mildly disappointing. The film faithfully presents us Bettie Page as she probably was: a playful almost-innocent from the rural South whose career as ""the pinup queen of the universe"" was for her just goofy	 natural fun. Her eventual moral qualms	 religious conversion and sudden departure from nude and bondage modeling are biographically accurate	 yet hard to understand given how untroubled she seemed by her livelihood.<br /><br />There are many reasons to see this film even so	 not least of which are the amazing b&w noir cinematography of W. Mott Hopfel III (complete with old fashioned wipes and dissolves)	 the 1950's-faithful acting of the cast under the direction of Mary Harron	 pitch-perfect performances by some of our most underrated supporting actors (including Chris Bauer	 Lili Taylor	 Sarah Paulson	 Austin Pendleton	 Dallas Roberts and Victor Slezak)	 not to mention the Oscar-worthy and technically difficult lead performance of Gretchen Mol.<br /><br />Ms. Mol does several scenes fully naked and most others in amazing period lingerie and ""specialty"" costumes (gloriously assembled by costume designer John A. Dunn)	 yet she astonishingly maintains Bettie Page's unstudied pleasure in her lush body. To watch Ms. Mol as Ms. Page	 an aspiring actress	 progressing through degrees of progressively less ""bad"" auditions and student acting scenes is to see a truly fine actress in complete control of her craft.<br /><br />The script does effectively bring us into 1950's America	 where childhood sexual abuse	 lawless abduction and rape	 and the legal suppression of brands of pornography which today seem laughably tame	 is a reality. 50's New York is evoked with seamlessly-inter cut news reel footage. 50's Miami comes alive in super-saturated	 16mm-style color. The real Bettie Page seems to scamper	 smile and pose before us	 and yet the effect is curiously lightweight	 barely lewd and not at all dangerous.<br /><br />How odd that bondage's greatest icon should be so lacking in venom	 and that this technically excellent biopic should have so little sting."	1.0
"If you love cult 70's Sci-fi the way I do	 or if you like movies such as ""Repo Man"" or ""Buckaroo Bonzai"" than you're going to love this one. It's a stream of consciousness 70's Sci-fi spectacular	 including a 22nd century junkyard and the Earth a million years from now. This movie is pure 70's. Put on Steve Miller's ""Fly Like An Eagle"" or Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side Of The Moon"" and you're ready to go!"	1.0
"I don't quite get the rating for The Amati Girls and I think I was REALLY kind giving it a 4 out of 10. What could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes. There are so many clichés in that flick	 the women's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake. There's no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over-acting over any limits that it hurts. It's not funny enough to be a comedy	 it's too fake-sad to really touch	 so in my eyes it's just not good. Watching it I couldn't believe how something like that made it to my TV set in my living room in Switzerland. But.. maybe it still was OK and it just got lost in translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the oddest movies I've ever seen and this certainly not in a good way! Sorry."	0.0
"I've now seen this film twice	 and I must say I enjoyed it both times. It's fast paced and fun	 but ultimately daft. Having said that it deserves to be trashed because of screwing up what could have been a good follow up to the seminal original. It is clear for those who have seen the awful 'Zombie Creeping Flesh' that the films massive shortcomings can be owed to Bruno Mattei	 and that the little that is commendable about it can be owed to Fulci. This is not idle Fulci sycophancy	 the directors styles are starkly contrasted throughout	 and you can tell who directed what	 particularly in Mattei's case.<br /><br />The film is centered around the outbreak of a virus (oddly referred to as 'top secret' by a scientist	 it's secrecy apparently being more noteworthy than its potentially apocalyptic effect on mankind) somewhere in south east Asia. The virus causes zombie like behaviour in those affected	 and the virus quickly spreads across a seemingly arbitrary area of land. Our protagonists unwittingly wander into the danger zone	 and have to fight for their lives against hordes of infected Asians.<br /><br />The film seems to be stuck half way between being a zombie gore flick	 and an out and out action adventure	 and this confusion is captured most clearly by the zombies themselves. They do not appear to have a set of characteristics common to all. Some are of the regular soulless shuffling variety	 so well rendered in the original	 and probably Fulci's creation here. The other main group consist of those who in being infected with the virus lost all sense of themselves	 but incurred a savage aggression and a desire to earn a black belt in ninjitsu: Indecisively leaping around unsure of whether to continue honing their upper roundhouse technique or engage with their brethren in what looks like a mass tickle fest on their hapless victims. Martial arts skills aren't their only talents either	 they are well versed in guerilla tactics	 hiding on rafters and under bales of hay	 and sometimes inexplicably falling from nowhere but the heavens themselves. This is all definitely the work of Mattei.<br /><br />There is a third	 more chatty	 variety of zombie. This type apparently retain a sense of irony as well 'I'm really thirsty...FOR YOUR BLOOD'. The ridiculous twist at the end in which the DJ turns zombie but continues to preach ad libbed gibberish about the fate of mankind	 only serves to enhance the WTF factor and obliterate any hope of a serious resolution.<br /><br />Then there's the infamous zombie head which slowly propels itself through the air	 a jokerish skeletal grin wrought across its face	 as if to say 'yeah we know how bad this looks'.<br /><br />The characters are all utterly one dimensional as you would expect. But its the pseudo comical dialogue and dubbing that really prevents us from taking their plight seriously. Having said that the first soldier to die does put up an impressively valiant display against an unstoppable zombie menace. Indeed this is the first and perhaps only time we hit real zombie agro	 and one of the only effective scenes in the film.<br /><br />The guy who played the chief scientist has heart	 but no talent	 utilising pauses in his lines entirely at random	 so he ends up sounding like a confused asthmatic. The scientists' on screen attempts at finding an antidote are totally unconvincing 'now lets put these two molecules together!' <br /><br />There are a few moments that stick out as genuinely effective however. In an early scene a female protagonist explores an abandoned garage. Upon entering a room we are confronted with a hazy view of a shifting figure in the corner and a squirming mass on the floor	 all shot in an atmospheric diffused light. The silence is interrupted by the appearance of a speedy machete wielding zombie who trashes everything in his wake in his alarming desperation to have her. His sheer aggressiveness is one of the few moments of real horror in the film. The before and after theme conveyed through the hotel that plays host to the happenings of the earliest stage of the outbreak	 and later as a refuge to our protagonists is imbued with an thick humid ambiance. There is a scene in which one of the soldiers cautiously approaches a boarded up room that clearly houses hordes of the undead	 and this is quite tense. Things become more dramatic when they board themselves in the hotel unknowing to what lurks upstairs. But this is sloppily handled and not nearly as effective as it could have been.<br /><br />All in all I would say this film may just about deserve to be called a royal screw up of a potentially effective tropical zombie fest	 rather than simply a through and through bad film. If nothing else it has plenty of the unintentional laughs that I've come to expect from just about anything Italian and gory from the eighties."	0.0
"The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedic. Everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry drop out. I have actually seen better acting in low budget porn. I though I had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene: Jim: Watch your ass Nick: You watch yours (together): I wont leave you behind!<br /><br />The first action sequence shows how awful the production is	 but its really kind of funny: Good guys have transformer weapons! In one scene	 they all have fake HK MP5 sub-machine guns. Next scene	 AK-47 replicas! And then	 to top it all off	 they do some weapon swapping between scenes with a couple of M-16s!! I think they had a budget shortage for guns	 not enough to go around between the good guys and bad guys. Fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake as all hell. You have to remove the pin/spoon from a grenade for it to explode on its own. You can't fire a shoulder launched missile of any kind while riding inside a helicopter. Weapons that you throw away don't suddenly re-appear. When a gun is out of bullets	 throwing it away is still pretty stupid. Unless you have no idea how to reload them.. Big slow trucks driving around in first gear make for awkward action scenes. I really cant believe movies like this are actually produced. This movie would be hilarious on nitrous oxide or maybe just drunk."	0.0
"As this movie is completely in Swiss dialect	 it's probably hard for most German speakers to really follow this movie. I'm not from Switzerland	 but I worked there for some years	 so I had the chance to understand this great spoof of the Lord of the Rings. I've seen a lot of movies of this kind (eg. Scary Movie	 loads of Scifi spoofs etc.) but this one is the best one of that kind	 I've seen so far. I give a 9 of 10. The only reason I can't give a 10 is	 because there are some little details which could have been done better and because they supplied no subtitles in any language on the DVD	 so there's almost no chance for non-Swiss to understand."	1.0
"This is the most elementary sort of traditional ghost story	 not even enlivened to any great extent by the use of Irish locations. If the great M.R. James had ever come up with a tale this thin -- doesn't James in fact have a story called ""A Thin Ghost""? -- he wouldn't have bothered to have it published.<br /><br />Orson Welles appears in the limp endpieces as a favour to a brace of old friends	 this film's producers. His presence and the one movie industry in-joke would have earned this will-o'-the-wisp its Oscar nomination.

"IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are partners in a company together with ESTEVÃO (George Freire)	 but the first ones contract a professional killer	 ANISIO	 to murder ESTEVÃO (the plot	 at least at the beginning	 doesn't explain very well why). The guy does it and after receiving his money he starts blackmailing the two partners	 appearing in their company and saying he wants a job there (as supervisor or something ). At the same time he meets MARINA (Mariana Ximenes)	 daughter of ESTEVÃO	 and starts dating with her! <br /><br />In a story like this	 where crime	 corruption	 betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand	 no one is innocent or can be victimized	 exception made to MARINA	 which is the only person who doesn't know what's going on and didn't betray anyone <br /><br />This film portrays with sarcasm the sad and cruel reality which exists in big metropolis like São Paulo	 where crime is every day's presence. We can feel irony but also veracity in characters like ANISIO (brilliantly played by Paulo Miklos)	 which does blackmail to the guys who paid him without any scruples	 and even flirts with the daughter of the guy he killed! He really must be a monster to do something like that	 but of course I know there're people like him out there	 in Brazil or any other place <br /><br />It's a very good movie	 cruel but truthful	 about a sad reality The acting is great and the soundtrack too."	1.0
"I really liked this movie...it was cute. I enjoyed it	 but if you didn't	 that is your fault. Emma Roberts played a good Nancy Drew	 even though she isn't quite like the books. The old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times	 but she looks good on them. To me	 the rich girls didn't have outfits that made them look rich. I mean	 it looks like they got all the clothes -blindfolded- at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together. All of the outfits were tacky	 especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits. I do not want to make the movie look bad	 because it definitely wasn't! Just go to the theater and watch it!!! You will enjoy it!"	1.0
"All you need to know about this film happens in the first five minutes: it looks cool	 it has a solid original soundtrack reflective of the late-60s period	 and all but a couple of its characters are unlikeable. Once you get that message	 you may as well switch to another film.<br /><br />Davies's protagonist ignores his beautiful girlfriend	 one of the few people in his life who cares about him. Then by the time he takes her advice to join her in the real world--instead of living a fantasy film of which he's the imagined director--he does so by pushing her aside and pairing up with an actress he's idealized beyond reason. A couple laughs and some thoughtful art direction are the only things worth watching here.<br /><br />The film is also interesting as documentation of Jason Schwartzman's fall from Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore	 Schwartzman's annoying brattiness was something to be overcome	 but here it's his character's only quality. Schwartzman's family connection clearly landed him in this role; here's hoping his choices improve."	0.0
"The movie is an extra-long tale of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the original adventure's spirit. The quite horribly American Patrick Swayze is cast as the British hero Allan Quatermain despite the obviousness of his nationality.<br /><br />The movie continues throughout to ""Hollywood-ise"" the story by changing both the plot and the characters to fit more comfortably into the accepted mold. The movie manages to be predictable throughout	 even to those who are not familiar with the story and is plagued by some extremely bad acting and terribly disappointing fight sequences.<br /><br />All in all	 a terrible addition to the already quite bad collection of movies based on the legend of King Soloman's Mines and Allan Quatermain."	0.0
"I really wanted to like this film	 but the story is ridicules. I don't want to spoil this film	 - don't worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen - but here's an example of how sloppy this film was put together. The Cowboy and ""Twig"" ride up the ridge. The Cowboy has a handle bar mustache. The Cowboy and ""Twig"" get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge. The Cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film. Sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave	 in dark	 on the back of a horse.<br /><br />To be fair	 the acting by the four main characters is solid."	0.0
"""The Last Big Thing"" is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous self-desctruction. The characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at/sympathize with. Which brings me to an introduction to the characters I liked best...<br /><br />Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s/early 40s who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine called ""The Next Big Thing"". Thing is	 this magazine doesnt really exist	 and it is only an excuse for Simon to get close to actors by interviewing them	 only to bitch-slap them silly	 insulting their way of buying into pop culture. His live-in female friend	 Darla	 is also writing a magazine (which is real)	 which mainly has to do with her and Simon	 as well as her and her father. Darla is a genuinely loveable (or loathable) character	 depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute	 the character i liked the best. Brent is a flat character with not much to him	 as is Tedra	 the music-video queen for a bunch of B-rated rock bands. Still	 these characters weave a very interesting web together. And this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it. Its a wonderful film and I suggest you see it if you're in the indie/art house crowd.

Basically the Hunter sisters Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in Rome for a Summer Intern Program	 but not long after starting their jobs they are immediately fired for a series of mishaps. But the man who owns the company they are working in	 Derek Hammond (Julian Stone)	 gives them their jobs back	 and they they do slowly prove themselves useful assets	 and talented (fashion) artists	 and help stop a mean man taking over the company. Also starring Leslie Danon as Jami	 Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan	 Ilenia Lazzarin as Dari	 Archie Kao as Nobu	 Valentina Mattolini as Heidi	 Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni. You can tell that this film was made to go straight to video	 the camera-work is completely mismatched	 and it doesn't help when you want to admire the sights of Rome. In fact the background is the only good thing to watch	 the twin sisters are two of the most annoying celebrities around	 I knew before watching that they weren't going to interest me in any way (their not even that pretty)	 this is awful gush of rubbish film. Pretty poor!"	0.0
"If you haven't seen Eva Longoria from the TV show ""Desperate House Wives"" then you are missing out. Eva is going to be one of the biggest Latina stars and you'll be seeing her in the theaters soon. This was Eva's first film and she does a fantastic job acting. She was 24 when she shot it	 and looked hot then. As for this low budget film	 it's pretty good for the first time director	 who has another soon to be released movie ""Juarez	 Mexico"" currently playing at many film festivals across the United States. In fact	 it appears that it may have a limited theatrical release from some news. What would be nice to see is a ""Snitch'2"" with a higher budget."	1.0
"A sweet little movie which would not even offend your Grandmother	 ""Saving Grace"" seems cut from the same cloth as a half-dozen other British comedies over the past two years...underdog is faced with adversity	 finds the strength to challenge and learns something about him/herself in the process.<br /><br />Widowed and thus broke	 Grace is a master gardener	 and is enlisted to help her friend/employee Matthew grow his pot plant. He's been doing it all wrong	 so Grace helps him out. They realize that she is the perfect person to harvest pot	 which they can both benefit from. He enjoys smoking	 she needs to raise funds to pay her mortgage. <br /><br />Highlight is Grace travelling to London to deal some of her merchandise	 dressed in what looks like the white suit John Travolta wore in ""Saturday Night Fever"" and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb. <br /><br />Blethyn is always watchable	 and you can't say that about a lot of people..well	 I can't	 anyway. Ferguson is very good	 and Tcheky Karyo	 who I liked in ""La Femme Nikita""	 is memorable. <br /><br />Not profoundly moving or insightful	 but immensely entertaining	 and at a brisk 90 minutes	 feels like a walk with friends. 8/10."	1.0
A really great movie and true story. Dan Jansen the Greatest skater ever. A touching and beautiful movie the whole family can enjoy. The story of Jane Jansens battle with cancer and Dan Jansen love for his sister. Of a important promise made by Jansen to win a gold medal to prove his sister Jane was right to believe in his talent in speed skating was justified. This picture is well worth the time. I wish they would make more films of this quality. Thank you for a great film with excellent actors and an excellent story. It is a very touching story about a beautiful family support and faith for their children and a special dream for their youngest son and his sister.	1.0
"First I'd like to excuse my bad English.<br /><br />I'm not a HOSTEL-hardcore-fan	 but I liked that movie nevertheless. Live Feed	 however	 SUCKED BIG TIME! I have never seen a gore-movie with superb acting	 but hey	 who's surprised? The acting in Live Feed was... well	 not there! I've seen some commented this as it must have been a school project or something. Okey	 but not by students in media or acting school. This was NO class at all! And what about the story? A really sad rip-off on Hostel. And what about the gore? What about the psychopathic torture scenes that supposed to make your guts twist and leave you cold-sweating? That was the most disappointing about the hole movie! Short	 quick and NO edge. More like an execution rather than a torture. Okey	 there where buckets of blood	 but it didn't even look real. The slaughtering and the violence reminded more of Braindead than Hostel or any of the Saw-movies. And Braindead was fun! Okey	 I laughed at Live Feed a couple of times	 but that was more out of disappointment than out of sheer fun!<br /><br />So instead of wasting 80 minutes by watching Live Feed	 watch ANYTHING else!"	0.0
"Thank God! I didn't waste my money renting it but i downloaded it! This happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life	 f*****g visual effects	 unnecessary gore and nudity! Far apart from other Zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead and others. There are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie. OK if you get time after reading this comment	 please check out the director's(Ulli Lommel) profile. After seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this	 i mean every movie directed by Ulli Lommel gets a rating between 1 and 2. And now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him	 but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence. Even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE."	0.0
"What a stunning episode for this fine series. This is television excellence at its best. The story takes place in 1968 and it's beautifully filmed in black & white	 almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images. This is a story about two men who fall in love	 but I don't want to spoil this. It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America. Written by the superb Tom Pettit	 and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc	 we move through their lives	 their love for each other	 and their tragedy. Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning. Our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters. Chills ran up my spine at the end when they played Bob Dylan's gorgeous	 ""Ah	 but I was so much older then	 I'm younger than that now	"" as sung by the Byrds. This one goes far past a 10 and all the way to the stars. Beautiful."	1.0
"Wow...OK. So	 after reading the little feud on here	 I decided I had to see this movie for myself. This movie is HORRIBLE. I stopped watching it. I strongly recommend cleaning a closet instead of watching this movie	 you'll be more spooked/entertained.<br /><br />It's low budget with bad acting.<br /><br />Whoever is giving this movie 10s is completely incorrect and should be disregarded.<br /><br />I am in no way connected to any of the other reviewers.<br /><br />Simply put	 this movie is not worth watching.<br /><br />Very	 very BAD MOVIE."	0.0
"Although I generally do not like remakes believing that remakes are waste of time; this film is an exception. I didn't actually know so far until reading the previous comment that this was a remake	 so my opinion is purely about the actual film and not a comparison.<br /><br />The story and the way it is written is no question: it is Capote. There is no need for more words.<br /><br />The play of Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts is superb. I have seen some movies with them	 each in one or the other. I was certain that they are good actors and in case of Eric I always wondered why his sister is the number 1 famous star and not her brother. This time this certainty is raised to fact	 no question. His play	 just as well as the play of Mr. Edwards is clearly the top of all their profession.<br /><br />I recommend this film to be on your top 50 films to see and keep on your DVD shelves."	1.0
"What we have here is a compelling piece of low budget horror with a relatively original premise	 a cast that is filled with familiar faces AND one of the most convincing filming locations in the history of horror films. So...could anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated??? ""Prison"" is the Finnish director Harlin's American debut	 which still counts as his best effort even though he went on making blockbuster hits like ""Die Hard 2""	 ""Cliffhanger"" and ""Deep Blue Sea"". The story entirely takes place in an ancient and ramshackle Wyoming prison	 re-opened for the cause of over-population in other	 more modern state penitentiaries. Inside the former execution dungeons	 the restless spirit of the electric chair's last victim still dwells around. The now promoted warden Eaton Sharpe (Lane Smith) was there already 40 years ago	 when this innocent man was put to death	 and the spirit still remembers his vile role in the unfair trial. It seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived. Viggo Mortensen plays the good car thief who has to prevent an even larger body count and Chelsea Field is the humane social worker who slowly unravels the secrets from the past.<br /><br />""Prison"" contains over half a dozen memorable gore sequences but it's the unbearably tense atmosphere that'll stick to you for certain! Unlike any other horror picture from that decade	 ""Prison"" features an amazing sense of realism! By this	 I refer to the authentic scenery and the mood inside the prison walls	 of course	 and not towards the supernatural murders that are being committed... even though these are genuinely unsettling as well. The film's best parts are images of realistic and tough prison-drama sequences combined with visual mayhem and shocking horror. The absolute best terror-moment (providing me with nightmares ever since I saw it at rather young age) focuses on a grizzly death-struggle involving barbed wire. Haunting!! The screenplay only suffers one flaw	 but that's a common one...almost inevitable	 I guess: clichés! The story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding. We've got the ugly	 fat pervert with his 'cute' boy-toy	 the cowardly and racist guard avoids confrontation at all costs and  naturally  the old 'n wise black con who serves a lifetime (did I hear anybody yell the name Morgan Freeman?) Don't stare yourself blind on these clichés is my advise	 as there are so many other elements to admire. The photography is dark and moist	 the mystery is upheld long and successfully and the supportive inmate-roles of class B-actors are excellent (the fans will recognize Tom Everett	 Tom 'Tiny' Lister and even immortal horror icon Kane Hodder). Forget about Wes Craven's god-awful attempt ""Shocker"" or the downright pathetic cheese-flick ""the Chair"". This is the only prison chiller worth tracking down! Especially considering Viggo Mortensen peaking popularity nowadays (I heard he starred in a successful franchise involving elves	 Hobbits and other fairy creatures...) this true 80's horror gem oughts to get an urgent DVD-release!"	1.0
"Blood Surf AKA Krocodylus is a fair film that has an okay cast which includes Dax Miller	 Taryn Reif	 Kate Fischer	 Duncan Regehr	 Joel West	 Matt Borlenghi	 Maureen Larrazabal	 Cris Vertido	 Susan Africa	 Archie Adamos	 Rolando Santo Domingo	 and Malecio Amayao. The acting by the actors is fairly good. The thrills are fairly good and some of it is surprising. The movie is filmed fairly good as well. Same thing goes for the music The film is fairly interesting and the movie does keeps you going until the end. This is a fairly thrilling film. If you the the cast in the film	 Monsters	 Giant Animal films	 Horror	 Thrillers	 Mystery	 and interesting films then I recommend you to see this film today!"	0.0
"Skippy from Family Ties goes from clean-cut to metal kid in this fairly cheesy movie. The film seems like it was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed metal music was turning their kids evil or making them kill themselves - except in this one a dead satanic metal star is trying to come back from the grave (using Skippy to help out). And while the plot is corny and cliche	 the corniness (for example	 an evil green fog taking off a girl's clothes)and the soundtrack are what make the movie so hilarious (and great). And of course	 there's nothing like Ozzy Osbourne playing a preacher who's asking what happened to the love song :). Definitely a movie for having a few friends over for a good laugh. And while you're at it	 make it a double feature with Slumber Party Massacre 2 - there's an ""evil rocker"" (as stated on the video box)driller killer in black leather w/fringe. A must see for cheesy movie fans."	1.0
"Difficult to call The Grudge a horror movie. At best it made me slightly jump from surprise at a couple of moments.<br /><br />If one forgets the (failed) frightening dimension and looks at other sides of the movie	 he is again disappointed. The acting is OK but not great. The story can be somewhat interesting at the beginning	 while one is trying to get what's happening. But toward the end one understands there is not much to understand. ""Scary"" elements seems sometimes to have been added to the script without reason...<br /><br />So... (yawn) See this movie it if you have nothing more interesting to do	 like cutting the carrots or looking at the clouds."	0.0
"Let's cut a long story short. I loved every minute of it. A lavish fantasy in true Arabian-Nights style. There's an evil magician	 a pretty princess	 a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after. Modern Hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic. Only quibble: the special effects are pretty dated (loved Sabu with the djinn's foot	 though!)"	1.0
"Don't let the title trick you into watching this movie. I read the title	 saw that it came on in the middle of the night	 and figured it was one of those soft porn movies. This movie is bad. If you like soft porn movies	 then I'm sorry to say this isn't one. There are a lot of sex but nothing shown and they only last for 5 seconds or so."	0.0
"A bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between the director	 Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as a secretary trying to save her boss from the electric chair by tracking down a mysterious ""phantom"" woman	 and Franchot Tone as a crazed and murderous sculptor. As well there are some fascinating smaller parts played by Elisha Cook Jr as a drugged out trap drummer	 as well as the other characters who make up parts of the conspiracy. If you're used to seeing Raines in more wholesome parts	 she's allowed to go overboard here	 especially in her scenes with Cook. Franchot Tone also plays someone very different	 and though it isn't a convincing part	 he acts phenomenally. While the conspiracy is too contrived	 the film has real atmosphere and is very interesting."	1.0
"John (Ben Chaplin) is a lonely bank clerk who lives in a small town not far from London. Though the Internet	 he contacts a Russian agency of brides. He selects Sophia (Nicole Kidman  the guy could be lonely and shy	 but certainly has a good taste	 doesn't he?) and when they met each other	 he realizes that she does not speak English. The communication between each other is basically limited by sex (again	 imagine	 what a terrible situation for the guy	 just have some kinky sex with Nicole Kidman!). On her birthday	 two Russian friends of her visit them. Then	 lots of surprises will happen. I liked this movie: first	 it is almost impossible to be 'labeled'. Is it a black comedy	 an action	 a thriller movie? I believe all the choices are correct. Nicole Kidman is gorgeous as usual	 and I am very curious about her Russian: is she speaking Russian in a correct accent indeed	 or just faking? Anyway	 I found it an enjoyable movie. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""A Isca Perfeita"" (""The Perfect Bait"")"	1.0
"This is the kind of movie you regret you put in your VCR. It is some weird bad rip off version of Stephen kings movie ""Misery (1990)"". I cannot understand how this movie got a 5.2 score	 because it has no story what so ever	 and when the movie finally ended	 I was relieved.<br /><br />This movie should have been released as a short-movie instead.. to much time is spent on the same thing. And as in every bad movie	 everything happens just at the end of the movie in a 10-15 minutes time span...<br /><br />So	 before you decide to watch this movie	 be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control	 because you are going to do whole lot of fast-forwarding... don't worry	 you wont miss anything important."	0.0
"Ms Patty Duke's story about her life and struggles with manic depression were just like my life struggles. I saw myself acting out just like her. I was so amazed at the similarities of our lives to include the sexual abuse that we both endured as children.<br /><br />I saw the movie when it first premiered in 1990 and I have loved this movie so much. Anyone who has struggled with manic depression could get so much from this movie. Never mind about if it showed her awards or what they were for. That is not the issue here. The issue is how Ms Duke had an illness and fought to survive it and overcame. Ms. Duke has much to be proud of in her accomplishments with her struggles for survival of a disease that often leaves many victims without hope.<br /><br />Unless a person has struggled with this illness personally they don't know the hell they have to live with. The movie to me was a success because it showed the real issues and how a person who is depressed and manic acts. It was so real...so	 so	 real. It was like watching myself up there on screen.<br /><br />I wish I could thank Ms. Patty Duke in person for having the courage to let the public know about her illness. Bocka"	1.0
"Some guy gets whacked. Right out in plain sight this other guy shoots him. He's got some bodyguards and they whack the killer	 but a reporter gets interested. She goes to the hospital where they took the guy who got whacked. She walks in	 and corners one bodyguard	 but he doesn't feel like talking. I can't figure out why. It's not like anyone else is interested. She's the only reporter there. Anyway	 her editor discourages her from working on this lame story. But hey	 she does anyway. She goes to see the killer's sister & mom. A few minutes after she leaves they get whacked big time-- somebody blows up their trailer-- huge ball of fire. Then she searches out the bodyguard from the hospital. She finds him hungover on his boat	 but a minute later they're both underwater sucking on a scuba tank 'cause three guys are trying to whack them (and have blown up the boat big time-- huge ball of fire). The reporter and the bodyguard whack two of the guys who are trying to whack them. <br /><br />In the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street	 there's a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse	 some car chases with wreckage & death	 a fake suicide	 etc. etc. Lotsa stiffs	 all kindsa carnage. <br /><br />Great stuff	 but what the reporter and the bodyguard can't figure is: why in hell the original guy got whacked. What's the motivation? Of course	 it might help us to figure out why the reporter's even interested. Through almost all of this she's the only reporter on the story. Nobody else in the media cares. Not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies. True	 the original guy who got whacked wasn't exactly a celebrity. His job was a little bit dull. He was just the President. Yeah	 the one who lives in the White House. Oh	 and the bodyguard is a Secret Service agent.<br /><br />Is that the spoiler?<br /><br />It should be. After all there are no TV cameras	 no other print reporters	 no bloggers... just another one of those police blotter crimes...<br /><br />So what's the spoiler?<br /><br />Lemme think...<br /><br />No! Wait! The spoiler is that his wife did it! Yeah... the First Lady. She was p---ed because the President was fooling around. And she gets away with it. She's really sharp	 huh? But how the hell could anybody ever figure that out? Why would anyone bother? After all	 only one reporter is even interested. <br /><br />I give this move a ""1"". It was so dumb I just had to keep watching. And it only got dumber! That's the real spoiler! But even though I've told you	 you've got to see it to believe it!"	0.0
"Sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness. I remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the re-release of The Excorcist really nervous laughter. It punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of Satan coming out of a 12 year old girl. In the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic The Wicker Man however	 it made me think that this new Wickerman is about as scary as the South Park character	 Scuzzlebut	 the friendly forest monster with TV's Patrick Duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm who's favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets.<br /><br />3 years ago a friend of mine in Hollywood told me that he heard that Nicolas Cage was going to do a remake of the film. I started laughing and my friend (Keith) got mad at me touting Nicolas Cage as a great actor. I just didn't think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers I was right. Gone is the realness	 the outstanding original music	 the originality	 the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue. Instead we have horror movie clichés	 affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart. Like many of the countless Hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground ""playing Wickerman"".<br /><br />The original film takes place on a remote Scottish Isle where a Scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named Rowan Morrison. In the new spin a California cop (Cage) is lured to an island of the coast of Washington state by his ex-girlfriend to find her missing daughter. She sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago. The crash still haunts him in part because the girl's body was never found. Yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north	 alone	 to help his ex-girlfriend find her daughter. He arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of Wiccans	 many of whom seem like they didn't get call backs for roles in The Village. And like The Village it isn't long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here. Not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison.<br /><br />I think that the opportunity in Hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry. I think someone like Nicolas Cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks. We needed a bad re-make of the Wickerman like we needed yet another '9-11' movie. I'm starting to wonder if Nicolas changed his surname from Coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so."	0.0
All I can say after watching Snitch'd is please stop Mr. Cahill. It is painfully clear you have no understanding of what you make movies about. If you insist on making movies about gangsters I urge you to do research. It's comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that even sound more absurd when they speak.<br /><br />I laughed at the part when Mr. Cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and proceeds to kick their butts in kung fu fashion. This movie was tough as an after school special. Who had the idea to have hats worn that say where a particular gangbanger was from?. I suspect real gangbangers do not wear hats claiming there gang. That would be stupid considering new laws that add length to a prison term if a person is gang related. <br /><br />Snitch'd is the WORST gangbanger movie ever made.	0.0
Hobgoblins is a very cheap and badly done Gremlins rip-off. That's the best thing one can say about this stinkpile. Pretty much everyone in the cast was chosen for their looks and not their acting ability. It was very painful to watch.<br /><br />Avoid this one at all costs.	0.0

"The spoiler warning is for those people who want to see for themselves what animals and landscapes pass before their eyes	 although I don't mention it in great detail.<br /><br />""Earth"" is an approx. 90 minute cinema version based on ""Planet earth"" which I watched all on BBC TV.The TV version was narrated by David Attenborough	 a captivating commentator	 who I had wished had also done it for ""Earth"" but it is Patrick Stewart	 Star Trek's Captain Picard. There are regularly shots of the Earth from space so that's may be appropriate. In any case he has a nice enough and calm voice for it. There are 12 chapters in which we follow animal life on earth from North Pole to Antarctica. 3 animal families	 polar bear	 elephant and whale	 appear in more than one of these parts. Each ""chapter"" starts with an indication how far from north pole or equator it is. We see something of each kind of animal	 but only mammals and birds	 and some fish	 and some beautiful shots of vegetation	 mountains	 waterfalls	 deserts and jungle	 a near perfect presentation of the variety of life and landscapes and climates on earth. You get the impression that our planet is only inhabited by animals: people or villages or cities aren't in the film	 so it's a typical nature documentary	 but breathtakingly shot and accompanied by delightful music. When the film opened I already knew it would end far too soon for me. It is a family film	 so no brutal killings of any animals. When one is caught by his hunter the shot ends and in other cases where we see the prey being caught it's shot in slow-motion which makes it less violent and watchable for young children (age limit 6 in The Netherlands). No blood is shed. Some scenes (newly born animals) are really cute and will be adored by kids. It looks like an ordinary nature film but when you know how many shooting days it took (4000) and how much money it has cost it becomes an even more astonishing piece of beauty. It had it's Dutch premiere yesterday	 a month before the actual release	 in a cinema of 500 seats	 of which 15 were taken. True beauty is rarely interesting for cinema goers	 it seems. As I knew the TV-series I was of course very curious if my favourite scenes would make it into this movie. Some didn't	 but the most impressive shots (big waterfalls) did	 luckily. It was the first time I ever cried in a nature film."	1.0
"I have to admit to enjoying bad movies. I love them I watch all of them. Horror especially. My friends and I all gather after a hard week at school and work	 rent some crazy tapes	 order a pizza and have a blast. This one had a great box	 so I was expecting less than usual.<br /><br />The story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above-ground layers bulldozed	 and the other underground layers are simply covered up. The inhabitants of this neighborrhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave. This wakes up some zombies.<br /><br />From this point on	 it's chunk-city. The gore effects and action never stop until the end credits roll.<br /><br />OK	 it's not great art	 but this one	 with its in-joke dialogue and over-the-top gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening. Actually	 it was one of the best ""party tapes"" I have ever had the pleasure of watching. And you could tell it was done on no money	 with a bunch of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies	 and the Director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has a cameo) and it is just a wild trip."	1.0
Cracking good yarn with all the actors giving great value. Michael Curtiz at his best. Lots of nice twists and turns and probably the best of the Philo Vance series. William Powell looks wonderfully relaxed and at his debonair best. A forerunner to the Thin Man series. Recommend to everyone. Did you figure it all out?	1.0
"Wow and I thought that any Steven Segal movie was bad. Every time I thought that the movie couldn't get worse it proved me wrong. The story was good but the actors couldn't carry it off. Also	 they made a lot of mistakes on how proper archiological digs are done. For instance you don't handle artifacts untill they are catologed and accounted for. The biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl. She is a weak actress and I felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic then it already was. The whole concept of the knights templar being underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me. I like the idea of how they disappeared and stuff	 so that almost seemed depressing. I thought that the characters wern't explained well enough. You didn't find out much background and that made it harder to relate to them."	0.0
"The movie lacks credence with the helicopters which didn't exist until the 1950s. But no woman would do what was done here	 even a woman before the women's movement of the 60s and 70s. About the only portion of the movie that you could believe in was that Germany would want to know where the landing would be. Ignore for the moment that the British had captured all the spies but even if they had not	 they wouldn't have let one roam around like this just to reassure the Germans that the landing would be at Calais. It isn't one major thing that makes the movie not work. It is the culmination of all the things wrong that makes the movie fail. Bad directing	 bad scripts	 no attempt at authenticity (at all) all combine to just make the movie fall flat. Generally speaking spies should fade into the woodwork. The suspense comes in with the spy wondering if the information they have is valid or not and worrying about being detected. On this one that game was over from the start. This spy was doing anything but spying. Your only chance at getting something that has some credibility and instills some suspense may be to read the book."	0.0
"How sad there is no option to post a mark lower than 1. I watched this piece of nonsense and could barely believe what i was watching. Every single part of the film was awful. Music	 acting	 direction	 story	 everything	 simply everything. I actually found myself laughing out loud at various points in the film. I particularly loved the bit where our hero is dashing through the hospital in soft focus slow motion	 and knocks the clipboard out of the nurses hand	 because	 .............well. Just because. Product placement? Crucifix's (crucifi?) everywhere. If you are of a Christian persuasion and very easily satisfied	 you may like this movie. If you do like this movie	 you really need to get out more."	0.0
"I loved this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is absolutely wonderful in it. Plays the role of the modern wizard to the hilt. (And is absolutely adorable.) 2) The movie helped to inspire a role-playing game I thoroughly enjoy	 Mage: The Awakening. I've shown it at various LARP after-parties	 and it's always a big hit.<br /><br />D&D love and Jeff-squeeing aside	 it's not exactly a masterpiece	 but it's well-done and thoroughly enjoyable. The plot is fast-moving and engaging in its simplicity	 the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget	 and the script	 while nothing stellar	 was not too badly done	 and cheesy in all the right places. A good way to spend an evening."	1.0
"I have been watching this show since I was 14 and I've loved it ever since. I love this show because it's just plain funny! You will enjoy this show a lot because it shows something new and funnier everyday and my favorite part is when Benny always has her last comments on George after every punchline about his fat giant head.*laughs* I would laugh and I'd watch it with my friends at home it'd be like we were watching a funny movie but short. Love George Lopez. Funny	 talented	funny	spectacular. This is a cool-funny-family comedy series enjoyable to everyone and you will definitely enjoy it--I did! And if you haven't watched it yet I suggest that you start watching because you wouldn't want to stop watching it. Even though there aren't anymore brand new episodes I still enjoy the re-runs. Still funny. Never wears off. <br /><br />9/10"	1.0
you can tell they spent 5$ making this.it is a waste of your time... ugh.. there is not anything remotely good about this movie... .. i don't know why i kept watching it.. the chick is not hot. horrid acting.. you could do anything and its a better use of your time.. like watching TV playing shitty video games.. i feel robbed. simply robbed.. of my time . i have never made a review for a movie before as you can probably tell but this movie i felt like i needed to save the poor souls that are about to watch it and looking on IMDb before to see if its decent and looking at the comments. -there was no action- -no hot chicks- -no budget- -shittttttttttttttty acting- it screams bad movie. ****the WHOLE movie is in a room.***	0.0
"I initially bought this DVD because it had SRK and Aishwarya Rai on the cover and I thought	 hey! another film starring Aishu and Shah Rukh	 little did I know that Aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with SRK and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just 15 minutes. Shakti is a film about a mother's love and endurance. It's a film about transformations	 ignorance	 coming of age	 stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life. The item number in which SRK and Aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie. It's actually a dream sequence that occurs while SRK's drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze. He dreams that Aishwarya Rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day	 dressed scantily and begins to seduce him. The title of the song is 'Ishq Kamina' (loosely translated as ""Love's a bitch!"") and it is just plain smoking hot! Don't miss it."	1.0
"this was a fabulous adaptation of Jane Eyre. the only problem i had with it was that i didn't like Zelah Clarke. i thought she was too old and made Jane seem much to timid. in the book Jane seemed like a much stronger character. i was really annoyed by this portrayal of her. the part where it's the morning after Rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me laugh. i think they made a bad choice in casting her. but Dalton was absolutely wonderful as Rochester. he makes this version of Jane Eyre worth seeing. another thing that made this version not quite 100% was the quality of film. i know it was made in the eighties for TV. if it had been a feature film	 and better quality	 it would have been perfect. my main complaint however	 is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old."	1.0
"Simply great movie no doubt about it. Great story and superb performances	 be it Amitabh	 Akshay	 Shefali	 Priyanka	 Boman or Rajpal. Hindi film industry is going shameless with Mallika and Co	 this movie is totally vulgarity free and therefore bound to fail in vulgarity addicted our Indian society. But the message and concept this movie carries are absolutely superb. Anu Malik(boring copy-cat) could have been avoided and Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiya could have been used as musician. I think Vipul Shah should have given little bit Gujarati touch particularly in music also. Anu Malik is worst musician around and he thinks himself popstar but this is not the movie where is presence was required-He looks only good with Govinda style songs. I felt some nice serious music with couple of good Ghazals or sad songs could have made this movie more memorable."	1.0
"Great western I hear you all say! Brilliant first effort! Well I'm not sure what film you all watched but it must have been a different one to the one I saw. Great westerns or indeed good films of any genre have characters you can believe in and this film had none! The acting was poor to say the least and I couldn't care less about any of the characters	 making the whole film pointless. the story was too big for the makers and perhaps they should try their hand at making straight to TV low budget rubbish like you see on those ""FACT OR FICTION"" programmes on sci-fi.<br /><br />Please	 if you are looking for a good film	 a great western or even just an enjoyable hour and a half	 please look elsewhere."	0.0
"Personally I think this show looks pretty cheaply made. Some of the actors are terrible. They over do it & seem fake. I can always tell how it's going to end within the first 10 minutes or less of watching because they make it so transparently clear. It's not very well written either. I love to watch it to laugh at it. You know the saying ""It's so bad that it's good?"" Well	 that saying applies to this show. I also like to watch just to see if I'm right when I guess how it's all going to end. So far I've been right every time. It's like a little game that I play. It's nice when you are bored & you feel like laughing at something."	0.0
"As I write this review in 2008	 we are mired in a remake culture. Movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as they can with thoroughly pointless updates including 'King Kong	 'The Wicker Man' and practically every film that ever starred Michael Caine. This lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon	 however	 as 'Dough for the Do-Do' proves. An entirely pointless colorized version of Bob Clampett's surreal masterpiece 'Porky in Wackyland'	 'Dough for the Do-Do' sucks the life out of the original by splashing colour all over Clampett's original footage and adding some lame new footage overseen by Friz Freleng. Freleng was an entirely unsuitable director to be tampering with Clampett's source material	 although in truth no director could hope to come close to Clampett's inspired insanity. Inevitably	 then	 'Dough for the Do-Do' is nothing more than the raping of a classic with an appalling new title attached. For cartoon fans like myself	 its equivalent to a colorization of 'Casablanca'."	0.0
"I had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago	 but its concept interested me when I heard it: an American man meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and they spend the night together talking. It sparked my interest	 but I never expected it to be this great. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece	 and it's also one of the most romantic films on record. To my surprise	 it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s. It's impossible to really talk too much about it	 since there is no real plot	 so to speak (although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about; it is sort of like My Dinner With Andre	 where there is a conversation	 but it's not JUST the conversation that matters)	 but let me just say	 see it. SEE IT!"	1.0
"I want to warn you that there is a very bittersweet quality to this comment. Also	 this comment will be much more meaningful to you after you have seen the movie.<br /><br />Although it is tragically sad to say	 that movie bears a resemblance to my life that is so striking that it is truly scary. The rest of you will never know how accurately that movie depicts how persons who have been in situations like that act and react in their later lives.<br /><br />This could not have been a work of fiction; it had to be based on personal experience.<br /><br />My testament to the how good the movie was is shown by the fact that	 although it was one of the best movies I've ever seen	 watching my life portrayed on the silver screen was such a searingly painful experience that I will never be able to see it again.<br /><br />But I endorse it heartily to all others as a chance to peer into the soul of another human being to the extent that you probably never experienced before or will ever again. I know that for a fact	 because that's my soul you will be observing."	1.0
"We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently	 we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore	 it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.<br /><br />This movie is very good. not just good but very good. The critics are a bunch of morons. Just because there is nudity and language they hated it. It was worth the price of ticket and that is all you can ask for. Is that not right? Every movie cannot be an academy award nominee. Sharon stone is gorgeous and does a great job in the movie and it mystifies me as to what in the hell the critics want"	1.0
"I turn on 700 Club once in awhile and only agree with some of the statements made- I'm one of many believers that is considered liberal by most Christians and conservative by most non-Christians. I vote my mind	 and its usually not rep. or dem. - i don't believe 700 club tells people what to believe	 but that it represents many older christians that grew up in very conservative backgrounds. i think many folks misunderstand what is said on 700 club. it bums me out to hear name calling either direction. i think 700 club folks really do love Jesus but are so busy trying to get people to vote conservatively that they've forgotten to show love to certain people and promote peace like Jesus did. Please don't judge Jesus based on ignorant individuals that believe on Him and let's also not be as ignorant with our comments about them. Why ARE people so mean to each other?"	0.0
"Saw it at UCSB's reel loud festival and was *shocked* that it won the golden reel award. I wasn't the only one	 considering the audience had mixed reactions to the piece. I thought there were many other better flicks out there	 but then I learned that the judges were heavily rooted within the area of film theory and other artsy crap. While the cinematography and editing are on par with many other shorts out there	 the storytelling is nothing more than your average student piece. Seems as though ""serious"" student films need to include one of these categories: sex	 intrapersonal struggle	 and eventual suicide -- Nick and Kate cops out and includes all three. Please	 be more original!<br /><br />Oh	 and it might be my outsider's opinion	 but the guy from montecito sounds a little fake. Does anyone else thing so?"	0.0
"You like beautiful girls? Yeah me too. What is there bad to say about beautiful girls/women? Nothing imo	 so why would I give this movie only 2 stars out of 5	 although it got the ""talents"" of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? <br /><br />If I really wanted to watch beautiful people	 I'd watch MTV or something that's why. This is a movie	 a so called action movie nevertheless. So by definition it does not even really need a plot right? I'm not agreeing 100%	 but let's say yes to that. So what does it need? 20 minutes footage from part 1 (I might be exaggerating a little bit	 but it felt like more than 20 minutes ...)?! That would be ""No"". But then again you never know	 the people who watched part one might not know what they ate this morning for breakfast	 so hey let's remind them ... hey maybe remind them even twice? Just to be sure they won't forget ... at least until the credits roll	 of course!!!! <br /><br />So forget about the story	 about character development	 about real emotions	 about the ""acting"" (and no	 I don't think women in skirts walking and/or fighting is accountable for acting!) ... what does that leave? Yes the action scenes. The action scenes are not bad and that's the reason I gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1! I was giving this movie a chance	 but it was a waste of time ... You have better things to do/watch	 believe me ..."	0.0
"While I have a great respect for Disney's animated films	 as of late they haven't really been what I would call ""must-see"". Atlantis looked intriguing from the first movie poster and trailer	 and thankfully lived up to my expectations.<br /><br />Atlantis is a more ""mature"" Disney film in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual trait for a Disney film indeed)	 and is focused more on action and discovery than any other recent Disney offering. The world of Atlantis	 hidden beneath the earth's core	 is fantastic	 presented as desolate caverns with ruins	 and then slowly developing into actual ecosystems	 which	 while usually containing some reminder of harshness	 become more and more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself is reached. The presentation of simply Atlantis' landscape and setting	 without some expendable cheery song	 gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance. The inclusion of an Atlantean language	 as well as attempts to connect it into the mythology of real-life ancient civilizations adds to this	 and works fairly well.<br /><br />Also	 with the exception of some scenes involving Mole's practical jokes	 there didn't seem to be much of a ""childish"" element that I usually associate with Disney films. Instead	 the main elements were the struggle to get to Atlantis	 and the constant discovery that occurred at Atlantis	 as Milo the outsider was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place by helping the Atlanteans discover parts of their own history that they didn't know about. Part of this involves the Atlantean ""weaponry""	 which is used in a very action-packed climax which is	 for lack of a better word	 quite exciting.<br /><br />Granted	 not all of the story makes full sense	 and the film doesn't feature any amazing new computer-generated visual effects	 but	 aside from the Toy Story movies	 this is the most entertaining Disney film I've seen in years."	1.0
"Dietrich Bonhoeffer's writings have had a profound influence on my life as a Christian	 and I eagerly anticipated watching this movie and finding out more about his life. Words can hardly express my disappointment. This movie was disjointed...it gave no background about his life	 no historical context	 and nothing about his great writings (except a brief	 passing reference to ""The Cost of Discipleship"" by a colleague at the beginning of the movie.) Instead	 we see him enjoying jazz (apparently in the States) and chilling out with his friends before he decides to go back to Germany. Apparently to show his human side. OK	 I'm ready for the dramatic part. The part where he stands up for his faith. Instead of emphasizing that	 we get a very badly acted romance with a 17-year-old schoolgirl. Whether or not that actually took place	 it should not have been a major portion of the movie. Now...still waiting for the dramatic part	 or some narration explaining what his writings were all about...or SOMETHING to make us know a little bit of the greatness of this man. drum-roll.....waiting..... ....waiting.....ZIP. Nada. This is the kind of movie that gives ""Christian Films"" a bad name. All they had to do was set up a structure for the movie to follow	 with some background...even some voice-overs	 or flashbacks to him preaching from his works...some narrative about who he was and where he had been. But no...this is what we got. Hardly fitting for a hero of the Faith."	0.0
"I found The FBI Story considerably entertaining and suitably upbeat for my New Years Day holiday viewing. Its drama and action-packed episodes were thrilling. The Hardesty character was well drawn and admirable. Overall the photography	 script and direction was perfectly creditable. Rather than taking the film to be a repugnant piece of propaganda	 as some might	 I enjoyed it as a well mounted portrayal of the necessity of ingenious minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime. Again	 the depiction of a family holding together even under the strain of the husband's commitment to his (arguably) important work	 I did not find to be a twee representation but an ideal and exemplary one."	1.0
"Ah	 noir. My favourite genre. Otto Preminger's follow-up to ""Laura"" is a film noir set in a postwar New York	 where corruption and violence run rampant. It stars Dana Andrews as Sergeant Mark Dixon	 a detective whose brutal tactics have landed him in hot water with his superiors. <br /><br />When he accidentally kills a murder suspect	 Dixon tries to pin the blame on crime boss Tommy Scalese. Dixon is close to achieving his goal when he becomes involved with the dead man's wife	 the beautiful Morgan Taylor. Of course	 in typical noir fashion	 things quickly go down hill.<br /><br />While the film does nothing interesting camera or narrative wise	 it does have a constant tone of dread and gloom. Like most great noirs	 it is also wonderfully paced	 sucking the viewer in right from the start.<br /><br />Still	 like most of Preminger's workmanlike films	 it's not something I'd watch again. It lacks the verbal wit of Wilder	 the visual flamboyance of Hitchcock or the spatial experimentation of Welles. Like Lang's later work	 ""Sidewalk"" feels very much a ""clone"" of what a noir should be	 instead of something really artistically genuine. <br /><br />Thematically the film is nothing special. It's about a cop who finds himself slowly becoming a criminal. In one scene Dixon explains that his father himself was a small time crook	 the film flirting with the notion of predestination	 but this one scene is as far as Otto goes	 or dares to take his ideas.<br /><br />The camera work is likewise disappointing. There's no intelligence in Otto's camera. No effort is made to assign the camera to anything. It doesn't play with space or architecture or empahsise the step-by-step police procedural. It's just tripod set ups with the occasional dolly in and out. Meaningless	 though most people don't care about these things. <br /><br />There is	 however	 one good shot where our hero is trapped in a car full of gangsters (noir cage) which itself enters a vehicle-lift (another cage) and is taken up into the chief gangster's lair. Like Lynch's ""Blue Velvet""	 Otto retopologizes the film	 constantly likens ""upstairs"" to hell. This works well	 but the set design fails to reinforce it. <br /><br />7/10 - Otto seems content to follow the Hawksian mould of what a noir is	 rather than toy with the possibilities of where noir can go. Like ""Detour""	 ""Night in the City""	 ""Scarlet Street""	 ""In A Lonely Place""	 ""Act of Violence""	 ""Bomberang"" and ""Johnny Eager""	 ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" is one of those well made second tier film noirs. It's competent and engaging	 but lacks that extra special magic."	1.0
"Wow...sheer brilliance.<br /><br />Turning a thriller/suspense/horror into comedy.<br /><br />After watching this	 I never laughed so hard at a horror movie before...a ridiculous plot with 3 characters that were just insanely developed - either not written in depth or too much depth.<br /><br />If you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialog	 messed up plot	 useless scenes	 wasted characters	 bad sound and lousy development overall	 then this is the one to watch.<br /><br />Be sure to keep focused for the classic ""food processor"" scene and the totally inept police investigation scenes.<br /><br />This is a remarkable new low in screen performance and writing and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either stupid	 daring or brave."	0.0
"Chris Rock deserves better than he gives himself in ""Down To Earth."" As directed by brothers Chris & Paul Weitz of ""American Pie"" fame	 this uninspired remake of Warren Beatty's 1978 fantasy ""Heaven Can Wait	"" itself a rehash of 1941's ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan	"" lacks the abrasively profane humor that won Chris Rock an Emmy for his first HBO special. Predictably	 he spouts swear words from A to Z	 but he consciously avoids the F-word. Anybody who saw this gifted African-American comic in ""Lethal Weapon 4	"" ""Dogma	"" or ""Nurse Betty"" knows he can elicit more laughter with the F-word than Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy put together. Sadly	 despite a few witty one-liners	 ""Down To Earth"" hits Rock bottom both as a contrived comedy and an improbable interracial romance.<br /><br />""Down to Earth"" utterly destroys any good will that the Weitz Brothers generated with their landmark gross-out face ""American Pie."" This disposable drivel qualifies as a contrived as well as confusing comedy with a thoroughly improbable color-blind interracial romance. Unfortunately	 a more than competent castamong them ""The Full Monty's"" Mark Addy	 Chazz Palminteri of ""Analyze This	"" ""SCTV's"" Eugene Levy	 and newcomer Brian Rhodes as Charles Wellington	 Jr.are wasted in flat-footed	 sketchy roles. Hardcore Rock fans will undoubtedly accuse their favorite comedian with trying to fix something that was never broken. Abysmally written by Lance Crouther	 Ali Le Roi	 Louis CK	 and Rock	 ""Down To Earth"" casts Chris as a messenger who rides a bike by day in the Big Apple and gets booed off the stage at night in Harlem's celebrated Apollo Theatre. Poor Lance Barton (Chris Rock) suffers from severe stage fright. Nevertheless	 his charitable manager Whitney Daniels (Frankie Faison of ""Hannibal"") sticks with him through thick and thin. After Lance learns the Apollo Theatre will hold one final amateur night extravaganza	 he implores Whitney to get him in the line-up. Excuse me	 but if Lance is such a deadbeat stand-up comic	 why does the Apollo keep inviting him back? Meanwhile	 fate has something else in store for Lance. While pedaling home on his bike	 our protagonist spots a pretty lady	 Sontee (Regina King of ""Jerry Maguire"")	 crossing the street	 but he doesn't see the bus that collides with him and kills him. Wham! Lance Barton levitates skyward with a halo wreathed around his head. In Heaven	 which resembles a cruise ship nightclub	 Lance learns that an overzealous angel	 Mr. Keyes (Eugene Levy of ""Stay Tuned"")	 timed his death 40 years ahead of schedule.<br /><br />Heavenly honcho Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri of ""Analyze This"")	 God's right-hand guy	 apologizes and escorts Lance back to earth. The snag is Lance cannot reclaim his corpse	 so he must inhabit another body. The best that Mr. Keyes can come up with is ruthless	 white	 60-year old tycoon Charles Wellington. Wellington's adulterous wife Amber (Jennifer Coolidge of ""American Pie"") and his unscrupulous personal aide Winston (Greg Germann of ""Sweet November"") have just tried to poison him. Reluctantly	 before Wellington's body vanishes	 Lance accepts it conditionally as a loaner until Keyes can locate a more appropriate body. Meanwhile	 Lance-as-Wellington encounters Sontee again. She is a nurse activist protesting his decision to privatize a Brooklyn community hospital that serves the poor. While Regina King brings a surfeit of charisma to her role as a crusading health care worker	 she plays a character who bypasses credible motivation in her affairs with Wellington. Although he is no longer black	 Lance not only tries to woo Sontee but also win a gig at the Apollo.<br /><br />""Down To Earth"" features Rock in his most unfunny role. The comedian's reason for making this movie seems questionable. Reportedly	 he ate lunch with Warren Beatty and told Beatty that he loved the original script that scenarist Elaine May had penned for Beatty. Initially	 Beatty tried the race-reversal gimmick himself in his own version by trying to cast Muhammad Ali in the title role of ""Heaven Can Wait."" The deal fell through	 and Beatty headlined the movie himself. According to Rock	 his longtime co-writers and he thought that they could 'annihilate' this classic. Moreover	 he justified his choice of ""Heaven Can Wait"" based on his philosophy to ""Do Something you can only do when you're hot."" Earlier	 Rock rejected a script about a busload of touring rappers	 because he saw little opportunity to stretch his image in such an outing. As a lifeless comedian in ""Down to Earth	"" Rock doesn't so much stretch his image as he inverts it for the worst! This half-baked concert film with an annoying plot does as much to cremate his comic reputation as it does the Weitz Brothers! You know a film about a comedian is in dire straits when a scene at the nightclub is played so you cannot hear the jokes	 only the laughter. Similarly	 the casting of Mark Addy as Wellington's butler who speaks the Queen's English but is in reality a commoner from Michigan defies logic	 too. Addy is an actual Englishman	 and he doesn't have to fake an accent; his accent is genuine. The major overriding quandary with ""Down to Earth"" is the on-again-off-again	 look-a-like switcheroo that the characters make so Chris Rock doesn't disappear completely from the sight for more than a few seconds. Although Chris spends half the movie as white guy Wellington	 audiences see him largely as Lance	 undercutting the comic irony of watching his stocky	 bald-headed	 Caucasian white	 alter-ego perform ghetto humor and chant derogatory hip-hop lyrics. Incredibly	 Rock served double-duty as the film's executive producer and one of its four scribes. The mystery is how such a wealth of talent could grind out such an awkward	 misguided muddle of a comedy. About the only redeeming feature of ""Down to Earth"" is Jamshied Sharifi's superb orchestral film score."	0.0
"Before all	 I'd like to point out that I have not read the book	 so there was no chance I'd be disappointed in that aspect. The major flaw I spotted was historical detail	 with several cars	 trains	 clothes	 etc. I think don´t belong at that time.<br /><br />***Possible spoiler*****<br /><br />The technical aspect of the film is ok	 nothing to brag about. But the acting	 I think	 was terrific. I don't have no experience in acting	 still I can't believe how people can consider this terrible! Maybe they've only seen two movies (ever)	 and the other one must have been very good indeed!<br /><br />I specially liked Jeremy Irons	 and really understood his character	 someone who crawled up the social ladder with very hard work	 then fights against those who would take his life's work from him	 only he gets so involved in this fight	 he doesn't realize reason is no longer at his side	 and he ends up a beaten	 disappointed man. Irons made this so believable	 I sympathized with the character despite his brutality.<br /><br />After Jeremy Irons	 Winona Ryder is also wonderful as a romantic young women	 who is drawn into the revolutionary ideals by her boyfriend (Banderas	 he had an under-developed part	 I think)	 and Glenn Close was also very good. Meryl Streep had an average performance	 it was not bad	 just not up to the standards of the other actors. Watch out for Miguel Guilherme	 a fine Portuguese actor	 between so many stars.<br /><br />In contrast to today's movies	 here only the interpretations	 only people matter	 but at the same time	 it is not a pretensious film	 too worried trying to be intellectual. The best proof I really liked it	 I'm writing a review 7 years later."	1.0
"One of the best ""Amitabh comeback"" movies I liked. This was the phase when Govinda was going strong with Dhawan. The songs were awesome and totally as we call it ""masti"" type. An evergreen entertainer with the likes of the multifaceted Anupam Kher chipping in. The story line has a lot of hilarious twists and turns as is known for David Dhawan's potboilers. With a timely appearance by Mrs.Madhuri ""Nene"" Dixit	 it was a total riot towards the end. It was great to see Amit perform with such force and humor after a long exile. Although some may consider it a typical ""Bollywood Masala"" movie	 I would watch it any day. I am giving it an easy 8 out of 10 just for being pure Bollywood."	1.0
"My commentary has nothing to do with the political sentiments found in the film. In fact	 they're quite congruent with mine. What gets me is the fact that in terms of a movie	 it is stupid and devoid of any semblance of story	 motive or dialogue. Maybe someone should tell Neal that substituting lyrics of songs which are failing to inspire anyone outside of a dwindling audience isn't the same thing as creating characters who are motivated to speak because of events created by the writer or director. A silly narrative remains as such despite the iconic legacy of Neal Young. The most childish scene is the one where the devil dances his way into a bar	 slips a tonic to an unsuspecting hero	 who then finds his way onto the dance floor to mouth the words to Young song to the heroine	 who is unaware of what's taken place. Somehow these two dream up a scheme where they will go up the West Coast in search of????? Sorry Neal	 stick with music and leave film making to Steven Stills."	0.0
"In this forgettable trifle	 the 40-ish Norma Shearer plays a fluttery	 girlish socialite in Monte Carlo	 caught in a tussle between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be tempting to blame this movie's failure on the dull	 talky script	 or director George Cukor	 who never seems interested in livening up the film's generally comatose state. Mostly	 though	 it's the fault of Shearer herself	 who desperately wanted to keep playing ""young"" parts as long as she could get away with it. Inadvertently	 this makes ""Her Cardboard Lover"" a bizarre monument to an aging woman's vanity."	0.0
"A true dark noir movie and a very graphic film	 nice storyline of a man pursuing redemption	 that may have just left it all too late. Visually there are some really nice scenes artistically amazing as to what can be done with a minimal budget. Full marks to Gareth Maxwell Roberts and team	 I look forward to the next project with new ideas although hopefully more British actors would be great. Lisa Ray looked lovely not seen her before and hope to see her again in the future. Subject all interesting Sex	Drugs and Violence. Bring it on. I would definitely say to rent this one and check it out if you're in the mood for a semi moody noir."	1.0
"Wow. I do not think I have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that Edison had.<br /><br />His acting was PAINFUL to observe. The story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional actors	 heck	 even LL Cool J was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on. How the director and movie company figured that Timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend.<br /><br />His character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass	 and he is supposed to be the hero... I would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video. MAYBE if you have HBO and have NOTHING else to do at 2am on a Saturday night and you are drunk and stoned	 this may be OK.<br /><br />Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human 'Kermit the Frog' act in a Hollywood Blockbuster	 just didn't work at all."	0.0
"Sergio Leone spins in his grave... If there was any film that tramples upon a man's life work its this one. The lead character's ""lone wolf"" bravado is uninspiring and lame	 and the script was apparently written by a monkey with an eight grade education. Whoever's idea this was should be horse whipped. The only reason I'm spending time trashing it is because there's a 10 line minimum. Sergio Leone's family should sue	 not because its crap	 but because now it's immortalized as crap by MST 3000. Shame. Disgust. I blame Hollywood...at least Gary Busey makes crap that wont offend anyone but cocaine users and weapon experts...this film is pure blasphemy."	0.0
"'Major Payne' is a film about a major who makes life a living Hell for his small group of boys in the marines. This film does not really have a lot to offer	 but it provides several hilarious moments that are well-worth a watch. Don't expect it to be a memorable film	 however. Just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people. The confrontation between Major Payne and the chubby boy were hilarious	 and that's really all I remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on Major Payne. Again	 it is not a great film	 and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter."	0.0
"The problem with portraying a real life individual is that the performance can be good	 but still not work if the audience doesn't believe that the actor is portraying the person. That's the main issue with ""Young Mr. Lincoln:"" Henry Fonda gives a terrific performance	 but I found it hard to believe that Abraham Lincoln was as soft-spoken as Fonda portrays him.<br /><br />This is essentially a courtroom drama with a young Abraham Licoln at the forefront. Whether or not this was a true story	 I don't know	 but if it isn't	 then why tell it using Lincoln as the central character? Never mind though. In the film	 Lincoln is defending two young men who are accused of murder.<br /><br />There's really not much to the film	 and as a result	 it seems rather empty. I wanted more story and character development. The film is 100 minutes long	 but it doesn't feel like it. There are some little scenes featuring Lincoln and the blooming relationship with Mary Todd	 but they seem superficial.<br /><br />The acting is good all around	 but as I said	 Fonda's performance works as a character	 but not Abraham Lincoln. I just don't believe that the real Lincoln was that soft-spoken. True	 he has a big voice when he needs to	 such as when he persuades a drunken lynch mob to let the accused stand trial	 but Fonda portrays Lincoln too meekly. The other performances are solid though	 especially Alice Brady as Abigail Clay	 the mother of the accused. She's a nice lady who we can really feel for. Simple and uneducated	 yet very sweet; we can see why Lincoln wanted to help her.<br /><br />John Ford seems to think of this film as an epic	 and at the time of its release	 it probably was. But even then	 there's just not enough material to present it as such.<br /><br />It's a nice watch	 but not a classic."	1.0
"The world is facing imminent destruction and a suicide mission is sent to the Sun to avert catastrophe by firing a bomb into its fiery heart: yes	 it's Solar Crisis	 aka Crisis 2050	 which burned up a huge chunk of change that's never apparent on screen back in 1990 and returned barely enough to buy a Happy Meal for each of the cast in Japan before going straight to video (remember them?) in a re-edited version credited to one Alan Smithee. The plot hook's pretty much the same as Sunshine - suicide mission to the Sun	 saboteur on board	 logic cast adrift - except that this time they're not trying to reignite the sun but to prematurely detonate a solar flare before it can reach Earth. With a talking bomb. Voiced by Paul Williams. Who wants to be promoted so the crew will take him more seriously Given that the cast also includes Jack Palance at his most dementedly OTT	 Charlton Heston at his most rigid	 top-liner Tim Matheson at his most anonymous	 the original Hills Have Eyes' unforgettable Michael Berryman (you may not remember the name	 but you DO remember that face) and Peter Boyle as the industrialist out to sabotage the mission because	 er	 if it succeeds the world will be saved but his share price will go down	 you'd expect if not a laugh-a-minute at least a laugh every reel. No joy. This is the worst kind of bad movie: a boring one. The fate of the world may be hanging in the balance but the whole film is shot with a complete lack of urgency or momentum at the same unvarying deadly slow pace. There's low-key and there's walking through it	 but here the cast don't even do that. Instead	 they just stand still looking at screens in near darkness for most of the time. You keep on hoping for Paul Williams' talking bomb to suffer an existential crisis	 but instead the film just... stands there	 doing next to nothing. Literally. This is one of the most inert movies ever made  so inert that if Clive Owen had been cast	 he'd almost have looked lively by comparison. Even a poorly explained suicidal repair attempt fails to raise a fritter of interest since it mostly involves	 yep	 the cast just standing still looking at screens in near darkness. Even when the bomb prematurely goes into countdown before being launched they deal with the new crisis by standing still looking at screens in near darkness as if they had all the time in the world. Merchant-Ivory films have better action scenes.<br /><br />Things aren't much livelier down on Earth where the movie spends most of it's running time with Matheson's son/Chuck's grandson Corin Nemec trying to hitch a ride to the spaceport across an arid landscape with Palance's insane desert artist ""looking for that note out there while the chicks still dig me"" while waylaid by rejects from a Mad Max ripoff and evil corporate suits who track him down so they can release him on a nice beach. Just don't expect logic	 if you haven't already guessed that much. Best moment? A ditzy girl in a bar describing Jack Palance as ""An old guy with white hair and a face like rotting leather	"" though Chucky Baby taking out the villain's aircraft with a bazooka fired from the hip from an office window or beating up a barfly who likes his beret are welcome morsels of camp in a film that for 99% of it's running time offers a whole lot of nuttin'. Richard C. Sarafian's slightly longer original cut that played in Japan offers an additional six minutes but cries out to be cut down to a more manageable 17 minutes: the director of Vanishing Point must have thanked his lucky stars when the re-edit gave him an excuse to take his name off the film. A film so bad it's not good	 and painfully unfunny with it"	0.0
"I rented this flick for one reason Tom Savini	 I respect his work but this was a real let down	 I had horrible clichés	 half of the film was naked women so called ""fallen angels"" running around trying to act scary	 oh and then there was the occasional ""Blair Witch"" black and white motion sicken camera scenes. Tom's character was really awful	 Horrible script. And you got to love these lines they use. ""Is anyone there	 who is out there	 this isn't funny"" No but your acting was. I wish I could give this flick a 0! Oh the names of the characters. Judd	 Molly	 Ally	 Emilio	 but they did leave out Anthony	 The Breakfast Club reunite in the forest of unforgivable acting."	0.0
"Considering its popularity	 I found this movie a huge disappointment. Maybe I was expecting too much from this film. After all	 it is one of the most well known martial arts films of the 1970s	 but I could never figure out why. The story is uninteresting. It is also a very talky movie with sporadic action sequences. My biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character that I could root for	 since the intended hero is an idiot. Director Chang has no sense of style	 and he is unable to hide the glaring imperfections found in the narrative. I know this is not supposed to be high art	 but I found the movie boring. Definitely not the best example of this much-beloved genre. Its cult status escapes me. I recommend you to skip it."	0.0
"There are many kinds of reunion shows. One kind is where old actors are taken out of mothballs and set to recreate characters they haven't played for twenty or thirty years. These have mixed results. `Return to Mayberry'	 despite some silliness	 was okay; `Return to Green Acres' as execrable (Eddie Albert used a word for the script I won't repeat here	 but both it and the movie stink); `Rescue from Gilligan's Island' filled in a necessary gap in the story of the castaways	 though the show itself was silly even from a `Gilligan's Island' viewpoint. In most cases	 the scripts are weak; sometimes a silliness appears in the scripts that is too knowing  and in comedy it's nearly always fatal for the characters to know they're being funny. New characters are introduced who don't fit the mix. In the main	 these reunion shows are pretty weak. A second sort of `reunion' show is the kind where the cast lays its past aside but sits around	 telling stories	 reminiscing	 interspersed with flashbacks from the shows. Then there are movies based on the shows	 which are rarely good; and movies based on the history of the show (`The Brady Bunch' has had both of these happen to it	 with various results).<br /><br />`Return to the Batcave' uses nearly all the above	 with a wonderfully twisted viewpoint	 which makes it the best of the reunion shows	 and has raised the bar for the others.<br /><br />Adam West and Burt Ward and summoned to a showing of the original Batmobile. While they are there	 the car is stolen. <br /><br />The Adam West of the movie is a man demented. He called Jerry	 his butler	 `Alfred'. He opens a bust of Shakespeare in his apartment and reveals a hidden pole to slide down to the parking garage. He's obsessed with being a crime fighter	 when in fact he's merely a washed up actor. When the Batmobile is stolen he not only believes it's his duty as a crime fighter to recover it	 he drags and unwilling Burt Ward in as his assistant.<br /><br />The pursuit is largely loquacious	 with West and Ward reminiscing about the old days. It is broken by `flashbacks' with actors playing West and Ward in the old days. The modern scenes and the `flashbacks' both have the wacky lack of reality the show maintained. There are also running gags that show West is able to make fun of himself: in Ward's book about his time on the show	 he spoke frankly about West's libido and also his being a skinflint (West makes Ward pay for everything in their pursuit	 down to tips and bus fare). The clues they follow	 the characters they meet (even in flashback) all fit the mentality of the old series	 and there are several homages	 including a fist fight with written sound effects.<br /><br />The whole thing is extremely funny and done with great panache. There are also cameos by Julie Newmar (looking like she's had one facelift too many) and Frank Gorshin	 reminding us why he has such a cult following. Gorshin will be the Riddler when Jim Carey	 his obvious successor	 is long forgotten. The movie builds to a fairly obvious but funny climax.<br /><br />This show is a model for reunion shows  unfortunately	 there are few that can fit the pattern. This show had actors replaying their old characters; young actors playing a movie about the making of the show; the actors West and Ward reminiscing; and a modern-day movie with the real Adam West playing the demented Adam West. It has everything. If you loved the old show	 this is the stopper on the bottle."	1.0
"Six Degrees is a wonderful show! I watched the entire season online since I just found it and was terribly disappointed that there will not be a season 2 :'( and to top it all off	 ABC has now taken it off-line	 so it is unable to be viewed online anymore. Why would ABC create such a wonderful show	 with a great story line and with great characters just to pull it off the air without ever completing the tale. It seems it is left to our imagination to figure out what happens to all of our connected characters. Honestly though I feel that ABC could at least place the show online for viewers who enjoied it while they continue to air overrated reality TV shows. Six Degrees we will miss you."	1.0
"I don't know if this is a sitcom or not	 but I agree that this is one of the greatest television shows ever. It's great that this show still airs. And I love Michelle. It's cute on the episodes when she was a baby and she talked	 and she sometimes said something funny. Aw.<br /><br />This show can relate to children and teens and.. well	 families as they struggle through rough times and try to work it out as a family. I don't know who would ever turn down an opportunity to watch this show with someone. <br /><br />I love the episode when I think her name is DD.. the older girl accidentally stole a sweatshirt	 and she learned a lesson about stealing. That was a great episode. An example that this TV show shows the family working things out as a family.<br /><br />I recommend this show for everyone."	1.0
"I would say for it's time	 this movie was awesome...and yes if you have no desire to become a Christian	 then why bother watching it. I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it to be very moving. I see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the Left Behind series...they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people. I think in order to actually judge this movie	 you should see it			there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I am not mistaken...don't use our comments to judge	 see the movie for yourself!! God will bless you if that is why you are watching them."	1.0
"First of all I am a butch	 straight white male. But even with that handicap I love this movie. It's about real people. A real time and place. And of course New York City in the 80's. I had many gay friends growing up in New York in the eighties and the one thing about them i always admired was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live them. No matter what the consequences. That's courageous. You have to admire that. This is a great film	 watch it and take in what it was like to be a flamboyant African American or Hispanic Gay man in the New York of the eighties. It's real life. Bottom line it's real life."	1.0
"As many agree	 Origin is a beautiful anime artistically. The music	 graphics	 and the world created are gorgeous and it really stands above most other modern animated works. However	 if you are looking for more than this	 than I suggest looking else where. The beauty stops short of its appearance	 and when it really comes down to plot and characters	 there's nothing special. Action is slow and minimal and the people are flat	 corny at times	 and do not act realistically. Not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there... So	 in summary	 oh my goodness	 I've never seen an anime as beautiful as this one; and oh my goodness	 it's like... -poke- people don't act like that. It took a GIANT step forward in graphics and music in anime	 but it also took a few step backs to times of bad characterization	 and unfortunately	 there's not even that much action to make up for that..."	0.0
"As a fan of Eric Rohmer's studies of the contemporary war between the sexes	 I was very eager to see ""The Lady and The Duke (L'Anglaise et le duc)"" for how he would treat men and women during a real war	 the French Revolution. <br /><br />The film looks beautiful	 with each scene designed as a period painting	 like a tableaux vivant. And I expected much talking	 as that's Rohmer's style. But maybe Rohmer was restrained by basing the screenplay on a real woman's writings is why this mostly felt like a docudrama version of ""The Scarlet Pimpernel.""<br /><br />As awful as the excesses of Robespierre et al	 how about some recognition that the French aristocrats were spoiled brats? I kept humming to myself: ""Marat	 we're poor/and the poor stay poor;"" you could also pick a tune from ""Les Miz.""<br /><br />I wasn't all that sympathetic as the central figure has to go back and forth between her city home and country manor to stay ahead of the Revolution. At one point her maid claims the pantry is bare but sure manages to lay out a fine repast. I simply didn't understand her	 an English sympathizer who alternately rejects and defends her former lover and patron as he and the Revolution keep shifting political focus; I think I was supposed to sympathize with her consistency more than their political machinations	 like a character out of ""The Scarlet Pimpernel."" Hey	 the only reason she didn't go back home was her disgrace after an affair and child with the Prince of Wales or somebody. <br /><br />Usually in a revolutionary period there's some groundswell of change going on in relations between men and women	 but I saw none here. I once went to a Herbert Marcuse lecture that concluded with a lengthy Q & A; the last question	 from an audience member far older than the rest of us acolytes	 heck she had gray hair	 was ""Why are revolutionaries so grim?"" She was hooted at and Marcuse didn't deign to respond to it seriously -- but it's the only thing of substance I remember from the whole evening. Rohmer demonstrates that counter-revolutionaries are also grim and didactic.<br /><br />(originally written 8/11/2002)"	0.0
"This movie was excellent. A sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes. This is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie. You have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way	 Doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions. This equals on big happy movie in the end. This movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be	 so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets. You see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture. The cinema-photography is excellent	 in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers. Bound to be in Oscar contention for best foreign film."	1.0
"I rarely make these comments but I felt compelled to spare others the pain I endured in watching this movie. It's so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply can't suspend disbelief. The problem starts early	 when you see a government researcher tooling around in a new Porsche and dining with his team in a restaraunt that looks like a castle	 overlooking the Capitol Building in Washington	 D.C. That kind of life on a government salary? Hah! It only gets worse. Toward the end	 when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys	 the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die	 in order to cleanse the gene pool. The special effects are pretty good - any producer's money can buy that - and the lead actors have been great in other films	 but the screenplay and direction here are moronic. Many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind Paul Verhoeven's previous	 facially stupid movies (Showgirls	 Starship Troopers)	 but this movie should stop the wondering. He's just plain bad."	0.0
"Worst movie I have seen since Gingerale Afternoon. I suppose that this is a horror/comedy. I pretty much predicted every scene in this movie. The special-effects were not so special. I believe that I could come up with as good of effects from what I have lying around the house. I wish I could have something good to say about this movie	 but I am afraid that I don't. Even Coolio should be ashamed of appearing in such a turkey. I do	 after a little thought	 have one thing good to say about this movie - it ended."	0.0
"This movie is excellent and I would recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it. Or	 even better	 you could buy it because chances are you're going to watch this over and over. I can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was great back then. But after watching it again yesterday I've found it to be amazing.<br /><br />A good blend of comedy (although not as great as ""Mr Magoo""-another one of my favorites) and action. This deserves 10/10 and I'm hoping that they will make a sequel soon (fingers crossed). If you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then I'd recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours :)."	1.0
"I'm a big fan of 50s sci-fi	 but this is not one of my favorites. While the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic teeny bopper sci-fi flick	 the director counted too heavily on it to carry the movie. It's clear he was working with no money	 because the entire movie is loaded with bloated dialogue that goes on and on forever. I have *never* seen so much time-killing in a movie.<br /><br />There are probably less than 60 seconds of ""blob footage"" in the entire movie	 and most of the rest of it is people engaging in a lot of poorly-written	 run-on dialogue. It was fun to see Steve M. and Anita C. together	 but good heavens...how could casting have thought anyone in their right mind would believe them as teenagers?"	0.0
"This story about three women is a very sensitive study about: Muriël (Charlotte Van Den Eynde) the youngest	 Laura (Els Dottermans) who is about 37 and Martha (Frieda Pittors) the oldest who is the mother of Muriël. They live together in the same building. They have different expectations of life. The vital Laura wants a child. Muriël comes from a village and wants to change her life in Brussels. Martha dreams about her youth when she was a young girl. In fact nothing happens in this movie so you wait for something - for instances an accident - which could dramatize this story. As times goes on	 you discover that the director Dorothée Van Den Berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing more. This movie is disappointing because you expect the women to learn from their experiences which is not the case	 so one is left with a feeling of emptiness."	0.0
"There are many problems with Mystery Men. First of all there are too many different characters for all of them to be given complex or even interesting personalities. The special effects detract from the story and are not really that special. Paul Reubens is wasted in a pathetic	 juvenile role as a character who merely farts and speaks in an inaudible accent.<br /><br />Now onto the decent parts. William H Macy	 three heavenly words	 and his performance as the shoveler is pitch perfect. The sphinx is an exceptionally funny character who is only mysterious and merely spouts out the traditional mystical proverbs. Ben Stiller is very amusing as well	 showing a weak character trying to make it into the big leagues of superheroes. All of the characters do	 and that is an area which I found particuarly ironic. That is because all of the actors are Indie film actors trying to make it into the big leagues of Hollywood.<br /><br />To be honest	 the reason I thought it failed at the box-office is that America doesn't get irony.<br /><br />All in all I loved the film	 but I feel it would have worked better if more effort was put into tweaking the script rather than having unneccesary CGI landscapes and effects."	1.0
"JUST CAUSE is a flawed but decent film held together by strong performances and some creative (though exceedingly predictable) writing. Sean Connery is an anti-death penalty crusader brought in to save a seemingly innocent young black man (Blair Underwood) from the ultimate penalty. To set things right	 Connery ventures to the scene of the crime	 where he must contend not only with the passage of time	 but a meddling sheriff (Laurence Fishbourne). Twists and turns and role reversals abound -- some surprising	 some not -- as the aging crusader attempts to unravel the mystery. The climactic ending is a bit ludicrous	 but JUST CAUSE is worth a look on a slow night."	1.0
"I happened to catch this film at a screening in Brooklyn - it's difficult to describe the plot; it has a lot of wacky characters	 but let's just say I'd have a hard time choosing which one made me laugh the hardest	 I wouldn't know where to begin. Even the peripheral roles are well written and well acted.<br /><br />There are numerous small touches that make it unique and very enjoyable	 it has a few ""devices"" that pop up and add another hilarious layer. It is refreshing to watch; not some recycled stuff I'd seen many times before. If this film could reach a wider audience	 I'm certain it would be a real crowd-pleaser	 the story is so original and heartfelt.<br /><br />There's a lot here to like	 funny back-stories	 mishaps and misunderstandings which set up the final act and dramatic conclusion. Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with a ton of heart; it's a touching story with fast paced comedy woven throughout. Definitely worth seeing!"	1.0
"Wow	 it's been years since I last saw this movie. Watching it in 2008 is certainly different than watching it in 1986. Initially I didn't' think I would make it through the movie. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so obnoxious	 arrogant and disrespectful that I found it hard to watch him. He embodied every negative stereotype of Americans. If that wasn't bad enough	 once the small American town's finest workers were shown the image only got worse. On the opposite spectrum the Japanese were presented as emotionless	 robotic workaholics. The movie wasn't even all that funny	 I only hung in there because of the nostalgic value of it. And I'm glad I continued the watch.<br /><br />Just like boxing	 judges are swayed by how you finish the round. This movie went from about a three up to the seven I rated it because of the ending. The end was excellent. You always want a harmonious ending and this was just that. It was great that the town got to keep there jobs and keep the factory	 but what was most special was the marriage between the Japanese customs and values and the American customs and values. It was a mediocre movie that ended on a high note."	1.0
"This movie is now my gauge against which all other movies will be compared...as in	 ""was it as stupid as Revolver?"" I too was in the Toronto International Film Festival audience last night where a room filled with over 2000 people walked out in an eerie silence after being absolutely dumbstruck by 2 hours of sheer nonsense. Jason Stratham would have been amazing if only he had a purpose. Within the first 10 minutes he's given a proposition by Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (of Soprano's fame) which makes NO SENSE AT ALL! Then there's some shooting and then there's Ray Liotta wearing embarrassing bikini briefs	 then there's some animation	 Ray Liotta's naked butt	 lots of shooting	 teeth gnashing	 art house wanna be pretensions and more of Liotta's embarrassing body that elicited laughs at every showing...which I'm not quite sure was the reaction he was looking for...not 5 times anyway. Everyone in this movie thinks they're smarter than the average bear and Guy Ritchie thinks he's Yogi Bear incarnate. The story lines might have went nowhere but the posturing was outta sight! The only way this movie could have been worse is if Madonna herself was in it."	0.0
"I wasn't expecting this to be a great movie	 but neither was I expecting it to be so awful. I hated the mother character so much I had to turn the channel. I turned it back	 hoping it was just one part of the movie	 but no. And for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed	 or almost done out of a job	 or driven to madness inside her own home? Are you kidding me? I was raised to respect (and even fear) my mother but I'd put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in MY house. I was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother's house	 after all.<br /><br />I didn't buy any of it. I tried giving it several chances	 I really did. Sorry."	0.0
"One hour	 eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and I decided it was pretty lame. That was right after Hopalong (Chris Lybbert) drops on his horse from a tree to rejoin the good guy posse. I was pretty mystified by the whole Hopalong Cassidy/Great Bar 20 gimmick which didn't translate into anything at all. Obviously	 the name Coppola in the credits couldn't do anything to guarantee success here	 even with more than one listed.<br /><br />If you make it to the end of the film	 you'll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions I did. What exactly was the hook with the gloves? What's up with the rodeo scenario? Who was The Stranger supposed to represent? Why did they make this film? <br /><br />I could probably go on but my energy's been drained. Look	 there's already a Western called ""The Gunfighter"" from 1950 with a guy named Gregory Peck as the title character. Watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad. That one I can recommend."	0.0
"Anything that might have been potentially interesting in this material is sunk in the first few seconds with a disclaimer that the events we're about to see can't ever be known and ""This is the whisper [rumor] most often told"" about one of Hollywood's most sensational ""mysteries.""<br /><br />Okay. So we're not getting anything new (and E!'s ""Mysteries & Scandals"" gives you a better foothold on the particular incident...and that's not much of an endorsement). What do we get?<br /><br />We learn that Hollywood is a nest of viper's and decadents. No big news there. More interesting we learn what a washed up director is willing to do to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry and/or political establishment. It raises the question of whether Peter Bogdanovich is speaking from his own experience through these characters. But what's told is so cynical and ugly and muddled	 we're left feeling guilty for witnessing a bunch of hooey that passes itself off as history.<br /><br />The tone of the film has a curious madcap quality that I found more irritating than fun. We're not empathetic with anyone. And the great ""Citizen Kane"" polishes off the relationship between Davies and Hearts in a much more convincing way. In ""The Cat's Meow"" we're not ever sure of Davies motives for being with Hearst. As soon as we're told one thing	 she's off doing the other.<br /><br />And are we to believe that Davies was the love of Chaplain's life? Or is he just trying to cockold one of America's most powerful--and apparently moronic--citizens. The film never makes it clear.<br /><br />What is convincing are the production values. There's a glorious recreation of the yacht and period costumes. I got more out of looking at the construction of some of the lapels on the men's jackets than following a story that libels many of the the most well-known personalities in Hollywood history. No one will remember that the screenplay is pure fiction. The disclaimers that frame the film only make it all the more tentative and unsatisfying.<br /><br />The performers can't be faulted	 although Meg Tilly goes way past parody here. Kirsten Dunst never disappoints. She gives the most sincere performance in a sea of scenery chewing. Only Joanna Lumley rises above the material	 but so much so that she seems to be distancing herself from the whole enterprise rather than narrating it. One of her first lines is	 ""I'm not here!"" And I'm sure she wishes she wasn't.<br /><br />This isn't on par with Bogdanovich's trashy	 so-bad-it's-good ""At Long Last Love."" It's perched on attempting something serious	 but hesitates and stumbles chiefly because it's so full of bitterness towards ""the beast"" named Hollywood. This is ""National Enquirer"" filmmaking. And it not only soils the names of those who the film places on board the Oneida that weekend	 but the audience gets pretty dirty as well."	0.0
"Ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel. It's too easy. So I'm going to challenge myself to acknowledge the positive aspects of Little Man. First	 I'm impressed with the special effects. It really did look like Marlon Wayans' head was attached to the body of a little person. I never doubted it for a minute.<br /><br />Secondly	 I loved some of the unexpected cameos. David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant singer	 and his renditions of ""Havin' My Baby"" and ""Movin' On Up"" were priceless. John Witherspoon	 who	 coincidentally	 played Grier's father in 1992's Boomerang (if you remember	 he ""coordinated"" the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket) now plays Vanessa's father in Little Man. So that was fun.<br /><br />Beyond that	 this movie is about as believable as White Chicks. How dumb is it when even the doctor can't tell that it's a 40-year-old man and not a baby? He's got a full set of teeth!!! How is it possible that no one seems to notice that it's not a baby? Little Man is so bad that there's a Rob Schneider cameo. And please	 if you're stupid enough to waste $8 on this movie	 at least do me a favor and DO NOT bring your children. This movie is way too sexual for small children (lots of jokes and innuendo about sex	 going down	 eating out	 etc.)	 and I felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their kids to the screening I was forced to endure. If you insist on seeing an idiotic film	 as least spare your children the pain and suffering."	0.0
"This movie rivals ""Plan 9"" as one of the dumbest movie ever made. Always be concerned when the same person is the:<br /><br />1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Writer 5. Stuntman	 and 6. Editor. Unfortunately	 Justin Kreinbrink did all 6 jobs! IMDb shows that he and his father were western 'stunt men'. So maybe that was the problem. <br /><br />Here's just ONE example from the film: in the film the sheriff has to take a witness to another town for protection. Of course	 the bad guys find out and are waiting for them. But	 what happens? The good guys are riding along and a shot rings out and hits a tree near them. When the camera shows us the bad guys they're all just sitting on a log	 chatting. What's wrong with this picture!<br /><br />I could go on. Perhaps this film was meant as a comedy. If so	 it didn't do that well either."	0.0

This show is amazing	 although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word beginning with F that is four letters long (plus its extended version beginning with M) but it didn't bother me.

"A lot of talk has been made about ""psychological Westerns""	 but this is one of the very few that is truly in that genre. It has big name stars who perform very well	 but it is the director who makes this such a good movie. Stewart Granger loses his British safari hunter stereotype to play a haggard retired buffalo hunter who is revered in the West as one of the best. Robert Taylor plays the upstart (in contrast to the usual young upstart	 Taylor's character is middle aged	 too)	 who wants to slaughter buffalo	 and lures Granger into business with him. They hire two other big name actors	 Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn	 into being their skinners. Granger is haunted by the buffalo he has killed	 knowing that he may be to blame if they become extinct	 knowing if they become extinct	 the Native American way of life will greatly suffer. Taylor soon reveals a sadistic side	 but it is a realistic saidism	 unlike the one dimensional sadists of modern film	 created by nerds and dorks. He is insecure	 and needs human companionship. Still	 he won't stop at murder. The end pits the two against each other	 with a startling conclusion. The psychological effects of what they're doing are well depicted."	1.0
"So	 American Pie: Beta House is the 6th American Pie movie in the series. Although	 it really has nothing to do with the original three American Pie movies except some of the characters are supposed to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and Eugene Levy is in it (can't that guy get better gigs?).<br /><br />There is very little to compliment this movie on. There aren't any funny jokes. The acting is painful to watch	 especially the girl with the ""southern"" accent which sounds more like a Canadian's impersonation of a British woman pretending to be a hillbilly by using the word ""ya'll."" This movie makes me feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I apply to a college where nobody goes to class (but everybody gets good grades)	 girls consistently take their clothes off in public	 everybody has promiscuous unprotected sex without the burden of babies and STIs	 and you can ejaculate all over a girl's family photos without her minding? Really	 this series has lowered itself to the standards of softcore porn. Maybe for the next one	 they'll finally break down and hire Ron Jeremy as the lead. I'm sure they can just tie it in to the series by making his character Stifler's 3rd uncle once removed or something like that."	0.0
"This one was marred by potentially great matches being cut very short.<br /><br />The opening match was a waste of the Legion of Doom	 but I guess the only way they could have been eliminated by Demolition was a double-DQ. Otherwise	 Mr. Perfect would have had to put in overtime. Kerry von Erich	 the I-C champ	 was wasted here. And this was the third ppv in a row where Perfect jobbed. Remember	 before that he never lost a match.<br /><br />The second match was very good	 possibly the best of the night. Ted DiBiase and the Undertaker were excellent	 while the Jim Neidhart had one of his WWF highlights	 pinning the Honky Tonk Man. Koko B. Ware continued his tradition of being the first to put over a new heel (remember the Big Bossman and Yokozuna?). This was a foreshadowing of Bret Hart's singles career	 as he came back from two-on-one and almost survived the match. He and DiBiase put on a wrestling clinic	 making us forget that the point of the match was DiBiase's boring feud with Dusty Rhodes.<br /><br />Even though the Visionaries were the first team to have all of its members survive (and only the second since '87 to have four survivors)	 this match was not a squash. This was the longest match of the night	 and Jake did a repeat of his '88 performance when he was left alone against four men and dominated. I think he could have actually pulled off an upset. These days	 the match would have ended the other way around.<br /><br />One of the shortest SS matches ever was also one of its most surprising. Possibly the most underrated wrestler ever	 Tito Santana was the inspirational wrestler of the night	 putting on war paint and pinning Boris Zukhov	 Tanaka	 and even the Warlord in the final survival match. It was so strange to see him put over so overwhelmingly	 then go right back to his mediocre career. Sgt. Slaughter also did well	 getting rid of Volkoff and the Bushwhackers	 but that just wasn't a surprise. Tito was.<br /><br />I think the only point of the survival match was to have Hogan and the Warrior win together at the end.<br /><br />This show was boring and the matches were too short. The Undertaker's debut was cool	 but Tito Santana is the reason I will remember this one."	0.0
"Mercifully	 there's no video of this wannabe western that a stay-afloat vehicle for Big Frank at a time when his career was floundering. The story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his big gun brother and who gets run out of town by bad guys only to return to rally his townfolks with a new found courage must have been written by a back-room writer. All in all	 this show stinks. The story is basically boring	 ill-conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence. I must depart complete from the other reviewer who found it ""...underrated..."" The critics slammed it at the time and deservedly so. You'll have to catch it on the last show	 if you up late and having a bout of insomnia. But	 if you can sit through it	 you've more fortitude than most of my movie buff friends."	0.0
"I'm not sure what Diane Silver was thinking when she was making this movie	 but it obviously had nothing to do with Richard Wright's novel	 which the movie is based on.<br /><br />We read the novel this past summer for AP English 12	 and just watched the film. During periodic note-taking and checking of the clock	 I contemplated the chances of being struck by lightning. Of course	 the sky was completely clear	 and I was forced to watch the rest of the movie... and then write a 5-paragraph essay on it.<br /><br />Wright's novel discussed very real themes	 of the mind of a killer and the psychology behind it. Silver's movie turned a murderer into a victim	 which is NOT what Wright wanted (see: ""How Bigger was Born"" 454).<br /><br />I'm going to make this short and sweet: if you want to leave your consciousness	 in Raphael Lambert's words	 unsullied	 skip the movie and read the book. The 1986 adaptation is not thought-provoking material.<br /><br />... ::sigh:: Now I have to write the essay."	0.0
"I probably saw this movie first in about 1995. Since then I've returned to it many times. It's great! I especially like the first and second clips	 ""Creation"" and ""Civilization Rising."" Wow! This was so cool back in the glory days of CG animation. CG is way older than I am	 as I know the film ""Tron"" was made 7 years before my time. But this film was a landmark in the early '90s. It was probably the first collaboration of different CG experiments set to music. I like it so much	 I think I'll go watch it now. Bye"	1.0
"Definitely the worst movie I have ever seen... Can somebody tell me where should have I laughed? There's not a single hint or shadow of an idea. The three leading actors are pestilential	 especially the one (I think it's Aldo) from Sicily who _can't_ make a Sicilian accent!!! Not to say about the dream-like insertion about Dracula... just another expedient	 drawn from the worst cabaret tradition	 to make this ""film"" last a little longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do what they can	 but this so-called movie was really too	 too hard to rescue. I would have given it ""0""/10	 but the lowest mark was 1/10 and so I had to overestimate it by one mark."	0.0
"Having read many of the other reviews for this film on the IMDb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based. Upon this point I cannot comment	 having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously. However	 what I can say with certainty	 is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass; Let's be honest here - this film is just so much fun!<br /><br />OK ..so I must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character/s but let's put this into a clear perspective ..do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic 1960's Batman series does not remain faithful to the original DC comic book character? Or perhaps is there STILL unrest in same persons that the 1980 film version of Flash Gordon was too much of a departure from the original series?<br /><br />The point is	 yes this film is incredibly camp but that's precisely its charm!<br /><br />Former Tarzan	 Ron Ely plays the eponymous hero in this (and bears more than a passing resemblance to Gary Busey to boot!) and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles. Also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite Michael Berryman.<br /><br />Best scene? Far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when Savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke	 lemonade and milk at a formal occasion! Also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein Savage tackles his nemesis Captain Seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen!  Priceless!<br /><br />Simply put	 the film doesn't take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it. Great fun from start to finish! (and you'll be singing the John Phillip Sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed!)"	1.0
"I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time. I got to go to an advance screening	 and was thrilled because I had been dying to see it. I had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie. The audience all shared my laughter	 and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie.<br /><br />Kudos to Steve Carrell(who I had already been a fan of). He proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy. He has a style that I haven't seen before. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. Thank God there wasn't a cameo from Will Ferrell(love him	 but saw him too much this summer).<br /><br />There were parts of comedic genius in this movie. Partly thanks to Carrell	 and partly thanks to the writing(also Carrell). The waxing scene and the speed dater with the ""obvious problem"" were absolutely hysterical.<br /><br />I will definitely go see '40 Year Old Virgin' when it's released. My advice: go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it."	1.0

"I watched 'Envy' two nights ago	 on DVD	 at a friends house. The premise of this film is quite promising	 Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential	 but it completely fails to deliver. I watched it with about five friends and no-one laughed for the entire film. The jokes (which are few and far between) are NOT funny in any way... the story line is crap	 and they never answer the question... WHERE DOES THE SH*T GO? Of course the answer to that is NO ONE CARES. This film lacks any sort of comedy value	 and as a few other users have said the only thing that makes it even almost worth watching is Christopher Walken as the J-man. None of the characters are developed	 the plots so thin it's nearly transparent - and is that song throughout the film supposed to be funny??"	0.0
"... than this ;-) What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams would have worked together on one movie?

When Dave and Andrew starts to explore their new environment the movie gets really enjoyable... bouncing heads? well... yes ;-) <br /><br />anyway... this movie was	 imho	 the biggest surprise at this year's FantasyFilmFest...<br /><br />Just like in Cube and Cypher Natali gave this one a minimalistic	 weird but very special design	 which makes it hard to locate the place of the story or its time... timeless somehow..."	1.0

"This Showtime movie really deserves a far better viewer rating than a 4.5; I gave it a 10 based on the story and the acting of the two stars. After reading the viewer comments	 I was surprised at how many folks expected this movie to be a comedy. Yeah	 I see that IMDb lists it as Comedy/Drama under Genre. That sure is misleading	 isn't it? Fortunately	 I saw the movie before logging onto this website so I did not have that expectation. In fact	 based on the synopsis of what I heard	 I fully expected it to simply be a Drama. I'm wondering if disappoint at this not being a funny movie caused so many low votes.<br /><br />Another factor that might have caused low votes is that this movie is very much 'character-driven'. 'Driving Miss Daisy' is an example of another character-driven movie that comes to mind. Someone's previous comment complained about a boring trial. Tom's (Danny Glover) work scenes seemed to distract from the real plot of the movie. That is	 how he was engineering the upward social climb of his family - or his personal troops	 if you will. However	 they served to establish credibility and justification as his right to move to Greenwich and move 'up' in the world.<br /><br />Tom's obsession became a compulsion. He proved that he would stop at nothing to blend into the white neighborhood. His chagrin when another black person moved next door was not due to skin color. It was because of everything the 'interloper' represented; everything that Tom had left behind. In essence	 Tom had become an Oreo cookie: Black on the outside but White on the inside.<br /><br />The last 20 minutes of this movie are among the most powerfully written	 directed and acted (by Whoopi Goldberg) I have ever had the pleasure to witness. I realized that the climax of the film was not the obvious event that happened next door (don't want to give it away). The climax is verbal and Whoopi delivers it. I am still not clear if it is the conversation when she informs Tom which college Tom -Two is going to or when she releases it	 all in the middle of the night and Tom wakes up. Nevertheless	 the denouement is great. You know that life on that street will never be the same.<br /><br />My favorite kind of character-driven flick: people go through problems	 some pain	 do their dance	 they grow	 they change	 and life goes on. As an audience member	 I may learn something or be inspired."	1.0
"This is really terrible.<br /><br />The only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie I have ever watched	 I would have a suitable reply.<br /><br />I think it is filmed on 35 mm so it is already tacky like hell. I wouldn't have bothered commenting but I noticed some fanboys (probably connected to the movie) had claimed that this was the best movie since the Matrix. Let me debunk the myths and lies.<br /><br />There is nothing good in the movie. Everything yells tacky. The actress is ugly. The fight choreography is the worst I have ever seen. The fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish. Imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldn't hurt a kitten. Obviously	 the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie.<br /><br />I know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before. Unforgivable."	0.0
"I love this show. Period. I haven't been watching very long	 probably only about six months or so	 actually	 but it is now my favorite show and probably will be for quite a while. I love all of the characters	 except I don't really care for Donna. I'm not completely sure why. I just..don't find her funny	 and I don't think Laura Prepon is a very good actress. Other than her	 I find the rest of the cast pretty good. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp	 who played Erics parents	 were extremely funny. Topher Grace is also a great actor. Unlike a lot of fans	 I did not completely hate the 8th season. I still watch it	 and it does make me laugh. But	 if you compare it to the shows earlier seasons	 its..not good. Randy is horrible. The finale was decent	 nothing amazing	 but good. =] I do think it would have been better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to leave	 but oh well. I have the fourth season on DVD	 and someday I hope to have all eight seasons on DVD. Some of its most hilarious episodes	 in my opinion	 were 'Dine&Dash'	 'Grandmas Dead'	 'Red&Stacey'	 and 'Streaking'	 but I love every episode I've seen so far	 which is most of them	 I think. =] 9/10 stars	 I would definitely recommend it. =]"	1.0
"With a title ""borrowed"" from Werner Herzog and liberal helpings of Kubrick	 Haneke and Noe it is painfully obvious that Thomas Clay considers himself a cut above the usual sort of rubbish our British cinema churns out. ""Robert Carmichael"" (for short) sets itself up as a realistic study of youthful alienation and at the same time seemingly a critique of the Iraq war. The problem with the realism is that the characters are so patently unrealistic and atypical - contrary to the fetid imaginings of ""extreme"" filmmakers most teenagers are not drug addled rapists. As a critique of the Iraq war	 a film about youth violence (by a talented classical musician - subtext society has damaged this sensitive individual)is so infantile as to hardly bear thinking about. There are signs of technical ability but some reviewers have overstated this. Like Kubrick and Noe he does show that the desire to shock linked with supposed serious intent may be the worst cinematic con trick of recent film. People liked ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""Irreversible"" because they liked the rapes and the violence	 but most of all they liked feeling culturally superior for liking things that most hated. So too much Kubrick and not enough Haneke (a serious and moral filmmaker) here labels this as one of the most moronic films in years. (I am not against violence in film. To do it seriously is a hard trick though - people in cinemas cheered Alex in ""Clockwork Orange"" showing how Kubrick's supposed intent was missed by miles. Gratuitous violence is much easier to achieve and is less offensive than the pretensions of many art-film directors.)"	0.0
"Mary Poppins is definitely much better	 but this is a lovely film nonetheless. Angela Lansbury is splendidly dotty as Engletine Price	 and David Tomlinson has great fun as Mr. Brown. Their chemistry was just brilliant as well. The children	 however just lacked the same sparkle	 though Paul is very funny and cute. The songs were actually not as bad as some people say	 ""Beautiful Briny Sea"" is the best	 in fact all the songs are outstanding. The special effects were wonderful	 that had plenty of magic	 and the story is original enough. The highlights	 though	 like Mary Poppins	 were the animated sequences. The underwater sequence was beautiful	 but my favourite was the football match	 which was absolutely hilarious. The only other criticism was that I didn't quite get the ending when I first saw it. All in all	 a lovely film	 that is hardly ever on. 8/10 Bethany Cox"	1.0
"It's sad when you can see what a movie was attempting to do	 and it is quite obvious that it fell far far short of the mark. Film students should take this as a lesson and a warning. Would be graduate has an idea. He wants total control. So he writes	 directs	 produces	 his cinematic masterpiece all by himself. Usually	 his concept is far beyond his budget. Usually he writes an overblown script full of every tag line he can come up with. Usually	 he is more interested in the grand sweep of the story rather than on the nitty gritty of working with actors on individual scenes. Usually	 he ends up with a movie that is feeble in it's attempt to create miracles on a tiny budget. Usually	 he ends up with a series of encounters (we cannot do justice by calling them scenes) that feel like they were written by a 12 year old. And usually he ends up with badly acted scenes that fail to grab the viewer. When you look at Judges from this perspective you can immediately tell it's just the usual fare."	0.0
"John Heder was absolutely horrendous in this movie. I felt like I was watching a bad college kid act for the first time in a student film. Anna Farris was par for the course	 not good	 but not horrible (plus she's cute). Dianne Keaton should have known better. Jeff Daniels was the only saving grace in this movie (even though it was poor judgement on his part as well). <br /><br />All in all	 I would avoid this at all costs. I'm just glad I didn't pay to see it! <br /><br />John Heder will forever be stuck in the typecast role of' the dorky kid	' unless he does some SERIOUS work on his acting chops."	0.0
"Ghost Story (the TV Movie--1972) was the pilot for the NBC series. The movie was well-written and well-acted and	 I thought	 when the 1972-73 tv season started	 if the tv series is half as good as the movie	 then NBC has a winner. (I wish this film was available on video!!) The series was a colossal disappointment--even with William Castle as exec. producer. If	 however	you have a chance to see the original TV movie	 Ghost Story	 check it out. You won't be disappointed."	1.0
"It sounds as if it should be a biography of Claude Monet but it's actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a French synchronized swimming team. There are no parents or teachers to speak of	 no school	 and boys are represented by one peripheral figure	 the hunky Francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confused.<br /><br />Pauline Aquart is the youngest of the three	 only aspiring to join the team she so much admires. She's kind of odd looking. She's not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long	 bony limbs	 big feet	 and no derriere to speak of. She's prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips. After a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthralling.<br /><br />Adele Haenel is older -- more	 well	 more developed physically. What a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit	 sauntering around	 teasing the boys	 swishing her long blond hair. But she's not what she seems. Or is she? I couldn't quite figure it out. The French are long on paradoxes and short on consistency. No wonder Francois is always sniffing after her.<br /><br />There's not so much ambiguity in Louse Blachere's character. She's on the team too but she's dumpy and plain	 and sensitive about it	 and has an intense crush on Francois. Blachere is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performance.<br /><br />The movie deals with the relationships between these three	 meaning intrigues	 deceptions	 hidden feelings	 and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another. This is of course a tricky topic. It becomes trickier during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between Pauline and Adele. Not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie. The only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on	 and what little sex there is under the covers	 sometimes literally.<br /><br />I don't think I want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much	 partly because it's suggestive rather than expressed through action	 partly because it's complex	 and partly because I'm not sure I got it all.<br /><br />Let me give an example. Okay. Adele is the girl the others envy. She's also quite distant and self satisfied. On top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all	 from the handsome but dumb Francois to the bus driver she wants a favor from. She brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio. When Pauline approaches her about joining the swim team	 Adele uses her as a lookout during assignations with the guys. A superior and self-indulgent narcissist	 you know? But then the soi-disant slut takes the skinny Pauline under her wing and reveals to Pauline that she's still a virgin. Really? Yes	 really. Pauline begins to draw closer to Adele and Adele finally confesses that she'd like to rid herself of her hymen and she would like Pauline to do it for her. Pauline	 now drawn sexually to Adele	 performs the task with subdued relish. NOW Adele would REALLY like to get it on with a man	 preferably older and experienced. So she takes Pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows Pauline to the powder room. The two girls stand there staring at one another	 neither having overtly expressed a sexually tinged interest in the other. But Adele stands so close that Pauline slowly loosens her own reins	 reaches up	 and kisses Adele on the lips. Adele steps back	 smiling	 and says	 ""There now	 that wasn't so bad	 was it?""	 and then walks back into the club.<br /><br />That's a pretty close description of whatever is going on between Pauline and Adele -- but what the hell IS going on? Initially	 Adele treats Pauline like an irrelevant child	 later like a close friend	 finally like a potential lover -- and the minute Pauline responds	 Adele walks off satisfied. Is she USING Pauline the way she seems to be using men? Does it satisfy Adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude? I don't know.<br /><br />I've slighted Louise Blachere as the third member of the trio	 the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity	 but I've only skipped her for considerations of space.<br /><br />Should you see it? By all means. (Just compare it to the typical American movie about high school kids.) For men	 some of whom have never penetrated the female mystique	 this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot."	1.0
"This film is to my mind the weakest film in the original Star Wars trilogy	 for a variety of reasons. However it emerges at the end of the day a winner	 despite all its flaws. It's still a very good film	 even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installments.<br /><br />One problem here is the look of the film	 which isn't very consistent with the other 2 films. I put a lot of that down to the departure of producer Gary Kurtz. The first 2 films have that dirty	 lived-in look with all the technology and so forth. In ""Jedi"" on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned. This makes for a much less textured film. Also the creatures were excessively muppet-like and cutesy. At this point it seems like the film-makers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itself.<br /><br />Another aspect is its lack of originality. Where ""Star Wars"" created a whole new experience in cinema and ""Empire"" brought us to alien worlds of swamps	 ice	 and clouds	 ""Jedi"" lamely re-cycled the locations of the first film. First we are back on the desert planet Tatooine	 and then we are watching them face ANOTHER death star (maybe the emperor couldn't think of anything new... but you'd think Lucas or Kasdan could). Also we have these ewoks	 who really are just detestable made-for-mattel teddy bears	 in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookie-fight at the end of ""Star Wars"" if they hadn't run out of cash. It just feels like lazy construction.<br /><br />The most unfortunate aspect of ""Jedi"" for me is the weak handling of the Han Solo character. Whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time	 trading one liners with the droids. Instead of a real drama we're stuck with the lame pretense that Han is still convinced Leia loves Luke -- as if the conclusion of ""Empire"" where she confessed her love of him had never happened. The whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the Solo character was not part of this film's central story after his rescue. Ford	 for his part	 looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances. This is more like a 1990s Ford performance	 bored and looking ""above"" the film itself. Fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes. Lando	 an interesting character introduced in ""Empire""	 here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle. Only Hamill	 given an interesting development in the Luke character	 is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character. Probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work. And to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters. Really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package. Ian McDiarmid does excellent work as well as the Emperor. The film would sink if he had been too far over the top (as he was at times in the new films).<br /><br />Visually and in terms of effects work	 other than the ""clean"" look of everything it's hard to find fault. Jabba is a very effective animatronic character	 one of the most elaborate ever constructed. The space battles towards the end are very impressive.<br /><br />Ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears. But on its own	 it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and IMHO far superior to any of Lucas' later productions."	1.0

"This movie was excellent for the following reasons: 1) It contained great backdrops and sets. 2) It showed the disparity of a war-torn environment alongside a technological one. 3) John Cusack's acting was terrific. He portrayed angst very well. 4) It showed the vulnerabilities of everyone in a war-torn situation. 5) It gave us a picture of what might happen in the future in many respects. I was also impressed with the acting for the most part. Hilary's acting was	 I found	 the most stilted. The morals and values of everyone in a war-torn situation are up for grabs. The liberal journalist and the conservative business man are capable of doing anything in any situation and are equally unpredictable. Great stuff. PSP"	1.0
"The Shining	 you know what's weird about this movie? This is the movie that everyone	 for people who claim to not like horror films	 will always say that The Shining is a terrific film. This is Stanley Kubrick's classic vision of Stephen King's horror tale of madness and blood. This is just an incredible film and wither you have seen it or not	 you have heard of it	 know a few lines from it	 and know some of the classic images. Who could forget Jack's ""Here's Johnny!""? Who could forget ""All Work and No Play Make Jack a Dull Boy""? Who could forget that chilling ending? This is the film that is unforgettable and honestly in my opinion is Kubrick's best work. I know there is a lot of argument in that department	 a lot of people say it's 2001: A Space Odyssey or Clockwork Orange or even Dr. Strangelove	 but if those film pioneered film making	 then The Shining perfected it. This is the tale of isolation	 madness	 terrifying images	 and the ultimate ghost story that will crawl underneath your skin. <br /><br />Jack Torrance	 Jack's son Danny	 and Jack's wife	 Wendy arrive at the Overlook Hotel on closing day. The elderly African-American chef	 Dick Hallorann	 surprises Danny by speaking to him telepathically and offering him some ice cream. He explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared the gift; they called the communication ""shining."" Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel	 particularly Room 237. Dick tells Danny that the hotel has a certain ""shine"" to it and many memories	 not all of them good	 and advises him to stay out of room 237 under all circumstances. Danny's curiosity about Room 237 finally gets the better of him when he sees the room has been opened. Danny shows up injured and visibly traumatized after Jack tells Wendy that he loves his family. Seeing this	 Wendy thinks Jack has been abusing Danny. Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room where he meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd. Danny starts calling out the word ""redrum"" frantically	 and scribbling it on walls. He goes into a trance	 and withdraws; he now says that he is Tony	 his own ""imaginary friend."" Jack sabotages the hotel radio	 cutting off communication from the outside world	 but Hallorann has received Danny's telepathic cry for help and is on his way. Wendy discovers that Jack has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" formatted in various ways. Horrified	 Jack threatens her and she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat	 locking him in a storage locker in the kitchen. Jack converses with Grady through the door of the locker	 which then unlocks releasing him. Danny has written ""REDRUM"" in lipstick on the door of Wendy's bedroom. When she looks in the mirror	 she sees that it is ""Murder"" spelled backwards. Jack picks up an axe and begins to chop through the door leading to his family's living quarters. ""Here's Johnny!""	 and Jack's legendary image is born.<br /><br />The Shining is one of those films that you seriously have to make time to see	 this is an incredible film and still gives me nightmares. Jack Nicholson's performance is timeless and unforgettable. But one I also feel is extremely overlooked is Shelley Duvall	 her scene of finding Jack's rant All Work is incredible	 that's a look of horror and you can see that fear in her face after realizing her husband is mad. Also another incredible scene is when Jack sees a ghost woman in the bathtub	 it's honestly one of the most terrifying scenes in horror cinema. The reason this film is so well known is because it's a film of perfection	 it's been on The Simpsons	 it's been shown in other films and it's a film that will forever stay with you when you see it	 trust me.<br /><br />10/10"	1.0
"I felt asleep	 watching it!!! (and I had tickets for the midnight- premiere) Any questions? The most disturbing scene	 as far as I can remember	 was the techno-dance-i-dont-know-what-that-was-scene. By the way what an ending!?"	0.0
"I don't watch soaps. My grandmother still watches that one with the hour glass. I made fun of them it when I was ten (it was so easy).<br /><br />But this movie takes parody and spells it a new way. I found the story pretty damn funny. The fashions of the 80's - shoulder pads	 sequins	 and polyester - just top it off. The huge hair	 the high heels	 and the histrionics - what a combination.<br /><br />And all the actors just go to town	 chewing up their parts and spitting them out in a big well scripted pile. Sally	 Kevin	 Elisabeth - wonderful! Whoopi - great! Robert Downey - refreshing to see him back when he had such potential	 before the tabloids. And Garry: why did we have to wait so long to see him on film? Leesa Gibbons - hadn't been missing her	 but nice to include her as a real life entertainment reporter (and where do you apply for THAT job	 anyway?).<br /><br />Admittedly	 I could have done without Sally climbing the drainpipe. Lucy Ricardo did it	 how many times?	 as has every comedienne from Carol Burnett to I don't know who and I'm so done with it now	 I could spit peanuts if I had them. Apparently it's what you do when you're being funny in a tall building in New York. I'm just thankful they didn't pull out the flagpole bit.<br /><br />But it was cute	 it was funny	 it had plot twists	 it had an after credits ending before that was common	 it had clothes worthy of a second glance	 it had a great cast and it's got personal memories for me. Really	 what more do you need?"	1.0
"I saw this recently on a faded old VHS tape	 and remembered it dimly. Looking at it now	 it seems charming.<br /><br />When it was first released	 it was recognized by pretty much everyone as a spoof of coming out as a gay teenager. To hammer the point home	 the mother is seen reading a paperback copy of ""1 Teenager In 10""	 the most popular coming out book of the time. David Warner hams it up as the persecuting vampire hunter [= gay-hating evangelist]	 who is of course a self-loathing closet case. The list of sight gags and in-jokes that were included to make sure nobody missed the point would be too long to go into. The producers were having some good-natured fun	 and hoping	 no doubt	 to lighten-up as well as to enlighten.<br /><br />But I have no clue how a teenage audience would look at this film	 nowadays. In some places	 where there is education and culture	 the terrifying ordeals that gay teens had to go through are a thing of the past. But I'm sure there are plenty of dark	 nasty corners of our continent where it's just as bad as it always was."	0.0
"What made the French Connection work so well was the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). In this catastrophe directed by Frankenheimer (who also brought us such gems as Raindeer Games and the Island of Dr. Moreau) the movie focuses on Doyle and his singular obsession of capturing Charnier (Rey). The fictitious idea that the NYPD would allow Doyle to travel to Marseilles to find Charnier with the help of the French local authorities is laugh out loud funny. Correct me if I'm wrong	 but didn't Charnier skip town with 65 pounds of pure smack!!! A street value of 32 million but yeah	 let's send Doyle to find this guy	 it was his pinch after all. Please!!! The story was weak. The acting was terrible (with the lone exception of Hackman	 who completely overplayed his part). The direction was all over the place. Even the cuts between scenes were terrible. Do yourself a favor and watch the first installment twice and skip this one."	0.0
"Fever Pitch is a fun enough movie. It has a lot of funny moments (including a hilariously disturbing shower scene). Like most romantic comedies	 it has a ""dead zone"" in the middle where all the heavy	 ""she's breaking up with me"" stuff happens	 but other than that it continues to be funny until the end.<br /><br />Even though the plot revolves around fanaticism towards the Red Sox	 it's not overloaded with sports. You don't have to be a fan to enjoy this film.<br /><br />Of course that's easy for me to say: I've been a Red Sox fan since I was a boy	 too.<br /><br />7 out of 10.<br /><br />Barky"	1.0
"I loved this movie since I was 7 and I saw it on the opening day. It was so touching and beautiful. I strongly recommend seeing for all. It's a movie to watch with your family by far.<br /><br />My MPAA rating: PG-13 for thematic elements	 prolonged scenes of disastor	 nudity/sexuality and some language."	1.0
"Repetitive music	 annoying narration	 terrible cinematography effects. Half of the plot seemed centered around shock value and the other half seemed to be focused on appeasing the type of crowd that would nag at people to start a fight.<br /><br />One of the best scenes was in the ""deleted scenes"" section	 the one where she's in the principle's office with her mom. I don't understand why they'd cut that. The movie seemed desperate to make a point about anything it could and Domino talking about sororities would have been a highlight of the movie.<br /><br />Ridiculous camera work is reminiscent of MTV	 and completely not needed or helpful to a movie. Speeding the film up just to jump past a lot of things and rotating the camera around something repeatedly got old the first time it was used. It's like the directors are wanting to use up all this extra footage they didn't want to throw away.<br /><br />Another movie with Jerry Springer in it? That should've told me not to watch it from the preview.<br /><br />A popular movie for the ""in"" crowd."	0.0

The jokes are so not funny	 I understand that they are supposed to be taking the mickey. BUT do it with style	 this movie is screaming 1995 Saturday night live skits. Why	 I say again why do studios give money to hacks like Rob Stefaniuk - NEVER GIVE A COMEDIAN THE Opportunity TO WRITE DIRECT AND STAR IN HIS OWN MOVIE. DUH!"	0.0
"This is a pretty bad movie. The plot is sentimental mush. I suppose the production values are OK	 decent photography	 unobtrusive direction and all that. Mark Hamill was terrible. I've never cared much for him	 and this movie validates that perception. It's no wonder that he never really had any sort of career aside from his ""Star Wars"" films. I'll just say ""Buh-bye	 Mark"" as he sinks into well-deserved obscurity. On the other hand	 a very young Annie Potts utterly stole the show. She showed charm	 beauty	 and acting chops all in one performance. I remember seeing her in ""Texasville"" recently and taking note of her beauty. It's interesting seeing her from ten years earlier. Anyway	 unless you are interested in Miss Potts	 run away from this film screaming for the hills."	0.0
"I don't see how anyone who even likes Van Damne could like this movie.<br /><br />The movie actually starts out with some promise. I would say the action scenes at the beginning of the movie is excellent. The actions scenes with the family ward trying to save the twins is a great start and is good lead in to the main story. However	 the film is all down hill from there. <br /><br />It would have been nice if the director could have stayed with the original premise. That is the brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills. One brother is supposed to be skilled in Martial Arts	 but the other brother is supposed to be skilled in firearms. How convenient when the time arises that the brother who has never picked up a gun before all of the sudden is a great marksman	 and the brother who has not been taught any martial arts is all of the sudden doing the splits and high kicks.<br /><br />The plot	 action	 etc. are just plain ridiculous. My favorite scenes? How about when Van Damne is confronting an armed soldier with an AK-47. The soldier is about 100 yards away. Instead of aiming and shooting at Van Damne he is doing a war cry like he is wielding a battle axe and running at him. Van Damne proceeds to pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him	...while he is still about 75 to 80 yards away. <br /><br />This movie has one of the most disappointing endings. Bolo Yeung is a skilled martial artist. However	 instead of choreographing a decent fight. Bolo is throwing barrels at Van Damne like Donkey Kong. Absolutely aggravating movie that had so much promise. If your a Van Damne fan	 save your time and see Hard Target or one of his earlier films."	0.0
"i would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it weren't for ms. Claudine Barretto's performance. and i will take this time to overlook that Kris Aquino's here. and... end.<br /><br />i really AVOID watching Pinoy horror movies because stories lack originality and i really think that (some) writers don't give enough attention to the characters (and their progression) in their stories (redundant??). it was as if they 'pushed' the movie onwards when their storytelling stank. and my goodness	 creative exhaustion led them to rip-off other movies. why?? why did this movie get a good review?? i wouldn't give it that much merit. the movie was KIND OF scary	 but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with Filipino folklore... it goes into my list of 'most likely to happen' category. i just wished they spent more time improving the story lines and fix those flash back sequences	 never mind if the lighting sucked	 it wouldn't matter much if the content would blow you away..

"The year 1934 was when Shirley Temple played three major movies and really began to make a name for herself. Unfortunately	 the studios had to experiment to see what the public best liked about here. Two of those things were singing and dancing. Another was a short	 interesting film that kept people's attention and got their minds off The Depression. You know the other keys to Shirley's successful films.<br /><br />This film achieved none of the above	 despite the star presences of Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard and despite a very good director in Henry Hathaway. In addition	 there are too many talky parts in here which become simply boring	 and too many arguments between a sullen Lombard and Cooper. To top it off	 you didn't get the normal feel-good ending which is what the public wants. I guess they learned after this movie."	0.0
"A typical Goth chick (Rainbow Harvest looking like a cross between Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice and Boy George) gets even with people she feels have wronged her with the help of an old haunted mirror that she finds in the new house she and her mom (horror mainstay	 Karen Black	 the only remotely good thing about this travesty) buy. The acting's pretty laughably bad (especially when Rainbow interacts with the aforementioned mirror) and there are no scares or suspense to be had. This film inexplicably spawned thus for 3 sequels each slightly more atrocious than the last. People looking for a similarly themed	 but far superior cinematic endeavor would be well advised to just search out the episode of ""Friday the 13th: the Series"" where a geeky girl finds an old cursed compact mirror. That packs more chills in it's scant 40 minutes than this whole franchise has provided across it's 4 films.<br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />Eye Candy: Charlie Spradling provides the obligatory T&A"	0.0
"this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm still not sure if it was serious	 or just a satire. One of those movies that uses every stupid who dunnit cliché they can think of. Arrrrgh.<br /><br />Don Johnson was pretty good in it actually. But otherwise it sucked. It was over 10 years ago that I saw it	 but it still hurts and won't stop lingering in my brain. <br /><br />The last line in the movie really sums up how stupid it is. I won't ruin it for you	 should you want to tempt fate by viewing this movie. But I garantee you a *nghya* moment at the end	 with a few in between. If you have nothing better to do	 and you like to point and laugh	 then maybe it might be worth your while. Additionally	 if you're forced to go on a date with someone you really don't like	 suggest watching this movie together	 and they'll probably leave you alone after they see it. That's a fair price to pay	 I guess."	0.0
"When I first saw this show	 I thought it looked interesting. I watched it	 saw how it revolved around Sarah	 like the character sees the world...revolving around her. I got it	 but wasn't laughing very much.<br /><br />Onstage and in her show	 she's racist	 crude	 insensitive and hugely self-centered. I didn't get her at first	 and took it all at face value. Then I got to see her movie	 Jesus is Magic. I think that served as a Sarah Silverman primer for me	 explaining to me just what 'language' she's speaking. She's like Marilyn Manson	 working so hard to give us a faceful of horrible ideas and images	 but you eventually realise it isn't an assault	 it's a statement. And once you understand that	 you find you're glad someone's finally giving it to you straight.<br /><br />I don't mean to suggest only smart people will understand	 or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy. While I like a lot of 'smart' shows	 I still to this day do not see the humor of Curb Your Enthusiasm. I get the impression that it's good	 but I just don't get it. Many people will never get the Sarah Silverman Program	 but I'm glad I eventually came around.<br /><br />The creators of this show do work hard	 every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot	 but with songs	 or dream sequences	 production numbers. These people aren't putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertisers	 they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together. If I was to predict the future of this show	 I'd say it will go the way of Arrested Development and Freaks & Geeks. It will get canceled before it's time and live on in fans' hearts and on DVD. But take heart	 SSP creators	 your audience IS out there	 and we'll be watching for as long as they let you make the show."	1.0
"Exceedingly complicated and drab. I'm a bright guy	 but this was just too much for a tired brain. It would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing. Probably better for the US market. GC himself hinted that this alone did not supply his Oscar and you can see why.<br /><br />Still the sand dunes are pretty. The nail pulling is nasty. The attorneys drunk dad is a mystery. The cricket is good to see.<br /><br />Very difficult to write the required ten lines on this	 despite it being over 2 hours long. Thank heavens they shortened it. Admittedly we don't get to the pictures much	 but the last film we saw	 Walk the Line	 was 10 times better and I don't really like Johnny Cash. My wife says George still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so there's that.....am I nearly there yet ?<br /><br />How about now"	0.0
"A slasher flick	 made in the early 80's	 has a curse on it which has anyone who tries to finish it turning up dead. Years later	 a group of film students attempted to complete the movie - also resurrecting the films deadly curse. Great idea for a film	 but sadly 'Cut' is just another wasted opportunity.<br /><br />Unfortunately Australia hasn't had the world's best track record when it comes to horror. 'Razorback' (1984) was an out and out dud as was 'Holwing III' (1987)	 which was half an American film anyway. As for our foray into comedy-horror	 'Body Melt' (1993) is best left forgotten. The problem with 'Cut' is that the makers trying to create a clever horror satire a la 'Scream' (1996) but have no insight into the genre or what makes it work. And although this sounds weird me saying this about a slasher film but what 'Cut' really lacks is any ""heart"". Sure it follows the basic ""rules"" established by 'Scream'	 but it doesn't want to play with the formula	 instead it goes for a cardboard copy of the earlier.<br /><br />The killer	 Scarman	 is probably one of the most boring and uncharismatic villains in horror movie history. His endless barrage awkwardly	 lame one-liners would make the dialogue of a porno seem like Shakespeare. The cast never seem like their fully involved and look like their just waiting for a shoot to be over so they can collect their pay checks. And the feel of the film is like it's deliberately trying not to be creepy; looking more like an episode of 'Neighbors' or 'Heartbreak High'. By the way	 those attempts at MTV style	 hyper-cinema during the ""research"" sequence just look lame	 dated and out of place.<br /><br />If Australia ever gets a chance to do horror again (Which I hope we still do) maybe we should take a leaf from the 'Mad Max' (1979) book. Instead of trying to copy the U.S. we should be trying our own take on the genre."	0.0
"A year after losing gorgeous Jane Parker (Maureen O'Sullivan) to love rival Tarzan	 hunter Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) returns to the jungle to have another bash at winning the brunette babe's heart. Mixing business with pleasure	 he also plans to grab himself some ivory from the elephant graveyard that lies beyond the Mutia escarpment	 Tarzan's stomping ground.<br /><br />Accompanied by his slimy	 womanising pal Martin Arlington and a group of expendable bearers	 Harry finally arrives at his destination (having narrowly avoided death at the hands of savage natives and rock-hurling apes) only to find that Jane is still infatuated with her musclebound yodeller	 and worse still	 that Tarzan is refusing to let the hunters take any ivory from the graveyard.<br /><br />Nasty Arlington decides to resolve matters by ambushing and shooting the ape-man and then telling Jane and Holt that Tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile. Of course	 Tarzan isn't deadonly wounded; after being nursed back to health by Cheetah (!)	 he swings back into action just in time to rescue Jane from a tribe of vicious lion-eating savages who have attacked Holt's expedition.<br /><br />Tarzan And His Mate	 the second movie to star Weismuller as the jungle man of few words	 is often cited by fans as the best of the series; although I slightly prefer the original	 I can definitely understand the film's popularity: it's damn sexy and there are some great action sequences! The undeniable chemistry between Weismuller and O'Sullivan is fabulous and leads to some pretty steamy scenes	 and with both stars wearing eensy-weensy outfits throughout	 there's eye-candy aplenty for viewers of both sexes to enjoy (despite O'Sullivan's much-touted underwater nude scene actually being performed by a body double	 the lovely lass still shows plenty of skin	 even threatening to do a 'Sharon Stone' at one point as her loin cloth flaps to one side!).<br /><br />The film's most exciting moments come in the form of a wonderful underwater fight between Tarzan and a crocodile	 and the spectacular finalé where Jane is attacked by lions and natives	 but is rescued by her beau	 his monkey pals	 and a load of elephants in full-on lion-crushing mode (once again	 the violence is surprisingly nasty at times	 although as far as I am concerned	 there is nothing quite as shocking as the vicious pygmies and their gorilla pit from the first film). Cheetah also has his fair share of excitement	 dodging rhinos	 crocs	 and big cats	 riding on Tarzan's back as he crosses a river	 and even hopping onto an ostrich for a ride.<br /><br />Like it's predecessor	 Tarzan And His Mate does suffer slightly from some bad effects and unconvincing propsdodgy back projection	 a few laughable monkey suits	 more Indian elephants masquerading as their African cousins	 and poorly disguised trapeze swingsbut these shouldn't spoil your enjoyment of this very entertaining film. If anything	 they make it even more fun!<br /><br />8.5 out of 10	 rounded up to 9 for IMDb."	1.0
"This film provides us with an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many to get caught up in the busy occupation of doing nothing. We as a people of African descent owe it to ourselves to make a change to this cycle of ""all talk and no action"" and start to realise in order to make a change	 there needs to be less talk and more action. It is a powerful statement of the divisions of our people over small issues	 and our failings to recognise the bigger picture and the need to unite in order to make a difference... Despite its reference to the black community	 all viewers can learn something from the message this film seeks to portray."	1.0
"Colleges	 High Schools	 Fraternities and Sororities have been the most popular stalking grounds for maniacal madmen since the slasher cycle first became a popular cinema culture throughout the late seventies. Even backwoods cabins and campsites have rode shotgun to the amount of massacres that have taken place on campuses since Halloween categorised the genre as a cult horror category. From early entries like To all a Good Night right up until the big budgeted schlock of titles like Urban Legend or Schools Out	 there's usually always been a campus slasher lurking somewhere in the pipeline. Despite being picked up by Troma - the titans of B movie badness  Splatter University was heavily panned upon release and never really found an audience. Even notorious hack and slash websites like HYSTERIA-LIVES have written off Richard Haines' splatter yarn as one of the worst of the early eighties boom. I always approach criticised movies optimistically because there's often the chance than a few bad reviews can be unfairly contagious like a dose of the flu	 which crowds the judgement of certain authors.<br /><br />It begins in traditional fashion at the place where any maniac worth his salts emerges. Yep you guessed it  an insane asylum! It seems that one of the inmates has decided that he's unhappy with the level of service at the institution and therefore he's looking to take his business elsewhere. The unseen nut-job makes his break after stabbing an unfortunate orderly where the sun certainly doesn't shine. He obviously favours the dress sense of the murdered worker	 so he takes the liberty of borrowing his uniform	 blood stained trousers and all!<br /><br />Three years later	 we transfer to St Trinians College	 an educational establishment that is controlled by catholic priests. A teacher is busy after hours marking her students work when all of a sudden there's a knock at the door. Before she has a chance to find out what the unseen visitor wants	 he stabs her in the chest with a kitchen knife and she falls to the floor in a bloody heap. This of course means that there's a vacancy at the university and so we're introduced to Julie Parker (Francine Forbes)	 the lovable replacement for the recently departed lecturer. It seems that her arrival has inadvertently given the resident maniac all the motivation that he needs to go on a no holds barred slaughter-thon. Before long students and teachers alike are dropping like flies to the camera shy menace as he stalks the corridors and local areas armed with an exceptionally large blade. Suspicious suspects abound	 but can professor Parker solve the mystery of the campus murderer before she becomes just another statistic? <br /><br />I'm not precisely sure how many versions of this movie are available. The UK altered video was released under the alias of Campus Killings	 but the US copy that I own states that it's the complete unedited edition	 which could mean that there is a censored print floating about somewhere? I'd be fairly surprised if that was the case as Splatter University certainly isn't as gore-delicious as the hyperbole packaging would lead you to believe. One or two litres of corn syrup certainly don't stand up to gore hound's scrutiny when compared to the likes of Blood Rage or Pieces	 so in this instance the movie is somewhat over hyped. One thing that many critics have failed to mention is the charming lead performance from Francine Forbes	 who ends up carrying the entire picture on her shoulders throughout the 79-minute running time. Despite amateurish direction from Richard Haines she still unveils some magnificent potential that should have lead to the chance of another stab at serious acting under a more accomplished helmer. Unfortunately that possibility never came	 and bottom of the barrel bombs like Death Ring and Splitz certainly didn't help to nurture a talent that could have improved dramatically under the right scholarship.<br /><br />The rest of the cast members were par for the course of movie obscurity	 especially the wooden plank teenagers who for some strange reason acted like they were auditioning for a remake of Grease or The Wanderers. The bog standard point and shoot direction couldn't have helped to build much confidence in the project and the fact that the few signs of potential were undermined by the clumsy handling of the script writer left the feature effectively unredeemable. Perhaps the only claim of originality to be found in Haines' slasher is the brave attempt for the contrasting conclusion. Let's just say that it's not a final that I was expecting to witness in a movie that was so typical of the cycle.<br /><br />At one point in the runtime	 one of the teens says	 ""Man that Parker bores me to tears "" Well the same can be said for Splatter University	 which never lifts the pace above slow motion. With that said though	 Francine Forbes made for a delectable scream queen and undoubtedly one that I would have paid to watch again in a similar role. So that pretty much sums up this un-troma-tising ride. Slow paced	 shoddy but still strangely alluring; you'd have to be especially forgiving to give it a chance"	0.0
"You know all those letters to ""Father Christmas"" and ""Jesus"" that are sent every year? Well	 it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half-forgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them. As bizarre settings go	 it's a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is ""Dead Letter Office"". Having said that	 this is obviously an Australian film as opposed to a British one. If it was Royal Mail	 most letters get this sort of treatment anyway. I haven't been in this flat for two years and we're still getting letters for a Mr Wang	 some female priest of the Church of Latter Day I've-Never-Heard-Of-You and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company.<br /><br />""Dead Letter Office"" (the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up) follows the story of Alice (Miranda Otto) who grows up in a seriously divided home. Writing to her absent father	 she only learns in adulthood that her letters haven't been delivered for one reason or another. So	 logically	 she gets a job at the D.L.O. and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding Chilean immigrant Frank Lopez (George Del Hoyo). Slowly	 she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self-contained world of the Dead Letters Office to its knees?<br /><br />Nothing against this film but I was reminded of the god-awful Heather Graham film ""Committed"" while watching this. However	 this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again	 that ain't difficult. For a start	 this film is much more logical. True	 the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood. But at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel. It is also well acted. Both Otto and Del Hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they'll never find while other characters are peripheral at best. Part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly	 leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed. The other part is that when you consider Australia's draconian immigration policy (i.e. if you don't speak English	 rack off!)	 such a story is unlikely to take place in reality. The other characters	 sadly	 also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than odd-ball stereotypes.<br /><br />Despite that	 ""Dead Letter Office"" is certainly something a little different. It might not be to everyone's taste but I liked it. Yes	 it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes	 it's nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy-duty swearing and nudity (no chance of that in an Australian film). There ain't any major laughs	 there's no Bullet Time and the characters are usually one-dimensional. But it's the story that counts here and while it's not earth-shattering in its magnificence	 it's a pleasant enough way of passing the time. It's the movie equivalent of a Sheryl Crow CD - nice to listen to now and again but you wouldn't really miss it if it wasn't there."	0.0
"""Descent."" Yeah. Boy... I haven't seen anything this powerful and scintillating since Bruno Dumont's	 ""Twentynine Palms"" (2003). (By the way this film is not to be confused with another fairly recent pic about the topic of ""female empowerment	"" ""THE Descent"" (2005)	 directed by our Splat Pack friend	 Neil Marshall	 who also happens to be a major talent his own right.) But getting back to this ""Descent	"" the NC-17 rated (uh-oh) effort on which the lovely Ms. Dawson takes a producer's credit (congratulations) and directed by Talia Lugacy (strong chance that's not a real name)	 as good as it is (in moments)	 it will not be appreciated by most lay people out there because the script is pretty flawed. As a producer	 you really have to tighten up that script. Of course	 in the premise alone	 you have the promise of rising conflict	 but there still lies the task therein of accomplishing rising conflict.<br /><br />At times	 this thing plays like an interesting piece of experimental theater and	 well	 I guess I'll let the others who've already commented here speak to the boringness of it	 namely that which occurs in the second act -but find me a second act that isn't boring? There's also this Catch 22 that goes along with these quasi-independent films like ""Descent"" in which Rosario happens to be attaching herself to and leveraging her ""fame-identity"" to get a script into production that would	 under usual circumstances	 not get made at all while at the same time she is basically a miscast in the film's leading role. Rosario Dawson is gorgeous and	 apparently	 you can shoot this girl from just about any angle all day long	 but	 oh	 wow-wee	 how fast the time just slips away: Rosy ain't no undergraduate no more. That's part of the confusion about the screenplay: ""Is she a graduate student? A TA? No	 graduate students don't really have these type of qualms with football players	 do they?"" Again	 if you are Rosario Dawson	 Executive Producer	 that's the one of many	 many aspects to the professional film process you'll have to think about as you embark on this wonderful new role in your film career. And if you don't have the answer to why you're movie isn't convincing	 let me tell you: there is a boatload and a bevy of vivacious	 well-qualified	 undergraduate aged talents	 pining to get involved in the business	 who might have nailed that lead character down	 all the while	 looking just as darn good as you know who; but unfortunately without Ms. Dawson -no Honey	 NO money. I have to say	 the camera department did an outstanding job	 however	 because this film is really well shot (i.e. lit) in all its dreary/dreamy darkness. The nightclub scenes look wonderful; one can tell all those music videos are starting to pay off and the play with time... The shooting/framing is all quite excellent which makes the picture a rewarding watch.<br /><br />""Descent"" is good not great. However	 I have a feeling	 thanks to NetFlix	 this movie will find a life of its own. I hope this group continues making films. If you're into experimental American film-making	 cinematographic imagery of implausibly well formed college studs (or male model drop-outs) in their early twenties	 or if you're an undergraduate	 just plain angry at the hormonally aggressive young men that comprise less than half of your American university	 ""Rosario Dawson's Descent"" might be your flavor of RockaRoll."	1.0
"When our local TV station first launched	 it filled a lot of its schedule with old British programming. ""Lock Up Your Daughters!"" was duly aired	 and I -- swayed by the opening few seconds of the film -- popped in a blank tape. Best thing I ever did.<br /><br />The actors are beautifully suited to their characters and bring them to delightful life	 complete with appropriate accents (Christopher Plummer's Foppington will leave you in stitches	 as will Hoyden and her family). Double entendres abound	 plot-line wheels within wheels mix and match the characters	 hilarious sight gags lurk in every scene	 and risqué comments are made on a regular basis.<br /><br />I showed the film to friends a few years ago and they called the piece ""a lost treasure	"" as much for the cast as for the story. To this day I can crack up just thinking about the dialog. Should this gem ever find its way to a DVD release	 I'll be at the front of the line."	1.0
"This film	 though	 critically acclaimed	 has of course not yet been released in the U.S. on DVD	 like another great - Christine Lahti's ""Housekeeping""	 out the same year. But if you can support Region 4 (Australian) DVD's	 this little masterpiece should be in your collection. There are still some VHS copies available on the internet as well.Davis is complemented by a great story	 as well as memorable performances from her supporting cast	 especially Claudia Carvan and the late	 great Jan Adele. Amazingly	 or maybe not	 this film and its stars went unacknowledged at Academy Awards time	 as did ""Housekeeping""	 but treat yourself to both of them - you will be glad you did!"	1.0
"This picture came out in 1975 and it was the second in the three part series of the life of Sheriff Buford Pusser. Bo Svenson takes over the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser	 and Luke Askew plays the role of Mobster Pinky Dobson. The last that we saw Sheriff Pusser he was laying in a hospital bed after him and his wife who was killed in ambushed Sunday morning drive. After Pusser recovers he goes after the men that killed his wife. Is Pusser able to complete the revenge that he's after or does the mob try to take him out before he successes. The only thing that bother me about this picture that this was an actual true story. How could you leave in a town with this kind of crime and yet don't do anything about it. Since there was real no name actress in this picture I can't give it 10 weasel stars but I can give 8"	1.0
"Acting was weak	 but in a horror flick	 I can live with that if the story is good. It wasn't. The initial event was an clumsy and obvious ploy to exploit most people's adoration of kids. OK	 fine. Fast forward to the ""place in the country"" where they will recover emotionally. I like the revelation of the ghosts. OK	 cool--this will be a supernatural kinda horror story	 with rotting things partly in our world partly in...where ever. Then the action starts pulling like a three headed dog in a flurry of cats and birds--Is there an evil force trying to attack them directly? Is there an evil force trying to attack them INdirectly--make people do awful things they wouldn't really do? Oh	 wait	 no	 maybe the whole REGION is some kind of psychic echo chamber where ambient discord can reverberate into murder? OK	 hold on--maybe it's really just one little mentally tangled ""Delbert""-style redneck boy who misses his Mommy and is on some kind of spree like a K-Tel Norman Bates knock off? Oh	 yeah--extra points off: the only Black character seems to be the grandson of an ""Our Gang"" pullman porter. The actor plays it as straight as he can given the crummy dialogue	 but the fact is	 his purpose is ""Y'all done betta get outa heah	 Boss!"" At least they wrote him smart enough to GTF outta there. The bit with the little girl being silenced and pulled away was definitely creepy	 as was the chick in the shower. Those were just two of quite a few really delicious tidbits in this movie. The problem is that they are combined in disharmonious ways	 like a bite of steak	 a bite of chocolate and a bite of a Gummi bear. Each is great on it's own	 but mixed up? Bleah! Such potential. Wasted."	0.0
"What seemed as a good premise for a movie...unfortunately it fails to deliver on nearly every level. Very hard to follow at the start of the movie I actually found myself fighting the urge to turn it off the biggest problem from a visual aspect is the fact that the camera work is simply over the top with so many ""arty"" splicings and semi-subliminal cuts throughout the movie that actually distracts you from the from the overall story. It really tries too hard to immerse you in the moment and build to a suspenseful ending but the movie just has so many half conceived characters and non relevant script it just leaves you feeling disappointed and confused as to why they tried to go so deep with it."	0.0
"I rented this film to see what might be a bloody	 non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action-drama that makes Kickboxer look like Die Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and as Lou saves Reb from the gooks	 he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever. The Vietnam scenes are shot in someones backyard	 I swear! Lou is now brain damaged and Reb and him live together and own a bar. Super homoerotic. Lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and Reb goes on a killing spree to get him back. There is no good fight scenes at all	 the punches are two inches away from a person. Characters personalities change in matter of seconds. One guy is a bad and in the next scene he's good. The acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental Frank Stallone sounding song that would make you sick. I hated this film."	0.0
"the acting itself wasn't even that bad	 since it did't come to mind in the movie but whatever had this director in mind? the intended climb towards some climax completely missed the mark	..<br /><br />almost all scenes involve acting that stand so far from our own intentions and way of reacting on things that you don't really attach to any actor in the movie	..<br /><br />Empty silences	..In this case	 see through cheap method of boasting your way into potential metaphorical brilliance	..which just wasn't here at all	..<br /><br />I guess I'm bitching but shit	..2 hours of my time	.."	0.0
"Well	 I'd be lying if I said that this could easily rival Spiderman or the Batman movies. Still	 it was more appealing to me for it's moral value. I first bought the VHS when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite. My wife and I are avid supporters of Robert Townsend and have been since he used credit cards to finance his first movie	 ""Hollywood Shuffle"". True	 he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more believable	 but his movies are still fun.<br /><br />Meteor Man provides a hero with an Urban Contemporary feel. I always felt that	 if there were superheroes	 they wouldn't provide the same scenarios as depicted in the comics. Meteor Man is realistic hero with real problems: Car broken into	 bad neighborhood	 local drug-dealing gangs using children for distribution	 etc. The scope of his mission stayed pretty much within the community.<br /><br />What I found to be truly entertaining	 outside of James Earl Jones' ""young forever"" performance	 was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered powers. It wasn't long before they had a full agenda lined up for him	 without his input	 of course. It was hilarious to hear them offer to lend him out to other communities where their extended families lived.<br /><br />Yes	 the plot was weak	 the movie was predictable	 there was bad acting and continuity was rotten	 but it ranks #1 with my kids. Robert Townsend works to bring movies ""home"" so to speak. I doubt he'll ever truly be recognized as the talented actor/producer/director he truly is	 but there are and will always be	 those that love him for his efforts.<br /><br />One point to ponder about the film	 which I find amusing: Throughout the entire battle with Simon	 no one bothered to call the police???? Also	 what mother and father do you know that will watch their son fight from a window? My mother would have been right there	 scrapping by my side	 toe-to-toe. Dad would be loading his pistol. lol<br /><br />Rent it and check it out. It's worth seeing at least once and good for those of you that are fans of Sinbad	 Luther Vandross	 Bill Cosby	 Big Daddy Kane	 etc. Great job with the cameos Robert!"	0.0
"Don't even bother with this movie	 it's bad when judged on it's own merits	 but when compared to the 1972 original (which IS a classic) it's down right awful. And BTW	 somebody commented that the 1972 movie is bad when compared to the book. This is silly	 movies should never be judged against the books they are taken from. They are 2 completely different art forms (as if this needed to be pointed out but apparently it does). If you used this criteria for all movies then ""2001"" would suck and so would ""Forest Gump"" and ""Silence of the Lambs""."	0.0
"I have to admit I have always found it difficult to watch an Antonioni film from start to finish at the first try	 and even for this one	 I ended up watching it in three parts on repeated occasions. In the end	 I realised perhaps it was better that way	 because it forced me to stop thinking in the usual terms of plot and just enjoy the scenes one by one. <br /><br />The first part seems a lot more fragmentary	 which is not a bad thing	 it just requires more of an effort to follow. When it gets to the desert scenes	 all efforts are repaid in full. The stunning cinematography is only a part of it	 what really makes it all unforgettable is how the landscape is made into an overwhelming presence	 the silence and vastness of it	 the sense of sadness and freedom	 the way it fuses and contrasts with the two young characters. The desert is dead	 but at the same time it feels less distant and alien than the urban scenes in the first part. The dance between the airplane flying over and the girl's car makes for a series of great shots. The love scenes in the desert are simply beautiful	 it is hard to imagine this kind of approach from a film of our times. There is of course something very stylish and studied about them	 but at the same time they manage to express a sense of natural	 spontaneous innocence that is very rare these days. It all feels loose and unscripted (thanks also to the understated acting)	 but that is the result of a maniacal attention to detail and form	 which comes to its climax in the series of explosions at the end	 a really mesmerising spectacle. It just leaves you in awe.<br /><br />I don't really care for some the usual objections: boring - well	 yes	 it is	 if you want all films to follow a classic plot development and be packed with action twists	 but then if all cinema was like that	 that would be truly dull and sad; pretentious - maybe	 but when that kind of ambitiousness is coupled with actual skills	 depth	 and style	 pretentious is a compliment. The ""political"" criticisms make the least sense to me	 I don't see the point of approaching a film like this with ideological blinders or worse	 patriotic requirements. It just defeats the purpose. Perhaps it's true that	 like a previous commenter remarked	 Antonioni viewed these young 'hippies' and the politics of protests and riots with the police with the fascination of a foreigner	 but I think that adds something rather than detracting from the film. It's not true that hippies did not exist in Italy at the time (think of the '68 protests	 like in France)	 although they were obviously different from the American counterpart and in some ways even more militant. But his interest in this film was not narrowly political. The events seem more like a pretext for a film whose appeal has a universal	 timeless quality.<br /><br />A special mention for the fantastic soundtrack. Amongst other things	 this film	 along with Easy Rider	 is probably one of the main earliest precursors of the contemporary 'artsy' music video as well as the concept of a film soundtrack that would stand on its own	 but unlike the former	 it uses music in a much more subtle way	 blending it with the landscape rather than the action. <br /><br />If you want traditional narrative in a film	 then don't bother. If you want to be stunned	 be patient and you won't regret it."	1.0
"1914 was an amazing year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in films and he appeared in more than 30 films! While most of these films weren't particularly good	 they did give him a chance to slowly evolve his screen persona. However	 by this film	 the familiar ""Little Tramp"" character was still in development. Sure Charlie looked the part	 but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed. Instead	 Chaplin often hit	 kicked or did other nasty things to people for seemingly no reason at all.<br /><br />As for this very slight film	 it is interesting to watch for the cast. While they are not familiar today	 Chaplin stars along with Mabel Normand	 Chester Conklin and Mack Swain--all exceptionally popular stars with Keystone Films. The problem with this film is that while it has a few nice scenes	 the plot seems very vague and improperly developed. Chester and Mabel got to the race track (a very common theme in Keystone productions--it must have been located near a race track). Charlie and Mack show up and sneak in. Mack is chased by the police for doing this while Charlie slaps Chester around and steals his girl. In the end	 for no apparent reason	 the cops take Chester and Mack away--leaving Charlie with Mabel (who	 oddly	 didn't seem put off by Charlie's boorish behaviors).<br /><br />Unless you are a huge silent comedy buff or film historian	 this is a very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of Chaplin. What he and the other actors actually do on stage	 while not unusual for a Keystone film	 isn't particularly funny when seen today."	0.0
"Even if it were remotely funny	 this mouldy waxwork of a film would still be soberingly disrespectful. Stopping just short of digging up the boys' corpses and re-enacting 'Weekend At Bernie's'  but only just  producer Larry Harmon and the director of the frickin' 'Ernest' films use holding the copyright as an excuse to crap all over Stan and Ollie's legacy. Gailard Sartain does a fair Ollie impersonation but Bronson Pinchot wouldn't reach tenth place in a Stan lookalike contest; even if they were both spot on the film would be no less detestable. The less said about the surrounding catastrophe the better. Makes 'Utopia' look like a dignified swan song."	0.0
"Seriously	 I mean very seriously	 when I first started watching the show I thought it was good. But the plots just got worse. The storyline were either too boring or predictable. George isn't always funny	 he sometimes acts stupid. His jokes are overdone. His mom is the silliest character of the show. How can a mother treat her own son that way	 okay if it was the daughter in law	 but this was her own son. I give this show a 4/10 just because the first few shows were a little funny. The actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha do a great job. Don't know how these shows get to play for so long. <br /><br />If you're really bored like I was and have nothing else to watch	 I'd suggest you watch this."	0.0

"This early version of the tale 'The Student of Prague' was made in Germany in 1913	 starring Paul Wegener (who was also in 'The Golem' a few years later). In this film he plays a dual role (technically impressive for a 95 year old film to see them in the same shot) after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a pact with him for gold - the gold he needs to woo a countess he's previously saved from drowning.<br /><br />Moving at a fast pace (the film runs just over an hour) and fairly well written and characterised	 'The Student of Prague' has echoes of the Faust legend as well as Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde	 starting as it does with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil	 and developing into good and evil sides of the same person."	1.0

"I loved ""Anchorman; The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" and hoped this would be just as funny	 but alas	 it wasn't. Some bits are excellent though. I thought the sports guy	 Champ Kind	 professing his love for Ron Burgundy in the car filled with the other members of the news team was hilarious. Everyone is ignoring him and he just gets louder and louder and finally kisses Burgundy which doesn't get acknowledged either. But on the whole the story doesn't gel. It's a noble attempt	 however	 to salvage the unused bits from the first movie	 including an entire plot about some pretty benign would-be domestic terrorists called ""The Alarm Clock."" Maya Rudolph of Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has a couple of funny lines	 but basically this unused plot line has good reason to be unused in the first movie. The extras on this disk are pretty good	 with the best two being the filmed rehearsals featuring lots of improv comedy	 and the faux commentary with Will Ferrell and an ""exec producer"" who Ferrell discovers early on was not even a part of the movie in any way	 shape or form. Turns out he's ""just a guy"" who walked in the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer. It's some pretty funny stuff though and goes on for about 10 or 15 minutes"	0.0
"A young woman (Jean Simmons) is convinced by her scheming and dangerous aunt (Sonia Dresdel) and uncle (Barry Jones) that she's losing her mind and in very delicate condition that requires their supervision which turns out to be more like manipulation	 as they try to keep her as far away from outside human contact as possible. The only other person she sees is the estate caretaker	 a lascivious character played by Maxwell Reed	 whose caught the wayward eye of the middle-aged aunt. All of this	 the aunt and the caretaker	 the butterfly expert uncle who has a serious underside to him	 and the susceptible niece in the middle	 would have made for a darker and more sinister film. As it is	 a frame-up for a murder sends Trevor Howard (a fired government secret service agent who took a job at the estate cataloging butterflies) and Simmons across the countryside escaping police	 catching headlines of ""Police Net Closing In"" over her front page photo	 hopping on buses	 and winding up in Liverpool	 where they meet some wonderfully cast characters	 and finally face down the greedy and murderous aunt and uncle."	1.0
"This is strictly a review of the pilot episode as it appears on DVD.<br /><br />Television moved out of my life in 1981	 so I never followed the series or any part of it - which means that I'm immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting appears to have for most reviewers. <br /><br />(Possible spoiler warning) <br /><br />The pilot of Moonlighting is your basic ""caveman meets fluffball"" yarn	 where a ""charming"" red-blooded he-man manipulates a misguided woman into realizing what she really wants and needs. The premises that the script's ""wit"" is based on must have already felt stale around 1950. It also contains some frankly bad writing	 as in the scene where Maddie demolishes the furnishings instead of shooting the villain	 strictly in order to prove herself the inept female in need of masculine assistance. <br /><br />I often feel that Susan Faludi overreacts in seeing male chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment	 but in this particular case I'm all with her - Moonlighting has BACKLASH stamped all over it. <br /><br />In one sense	 however	 this DVD is a must for all serious Bruce Willis fans: in addition to the pilot episode	 it contains the screen test that landed Willis the job. Both features show to what amazing extent Willis' acting ability developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1	 In Country). Impressive! <br /><br />Rating (and I _am_ a Bruce Willis fan): 2 out of 10"	0.0
"'Holes' was a GREAT movie. Disney made the right choice. Every person who I have talked to about it said they LOVED it.

"Painful to watch	 and not entirely for empathy with the struggles of the characters. Two of the main characters	 Cynthia the mother and Monica the acknowledged daughter	 spend the great bulk of the film pathetically mewling and bitterly bitching respectively. Their characters are so firmly established that their redemption into tolerable personalities after a quick family catharsis is unbelievable. It wasn't worth the wait. I wish a worthy pitch for honesty among families was less of a headache to view."	0.0
"This is the most saccharine romance I ever sat through. The perfect film for an idle housewife in kerchief	 housedress	 and ostrich-trimmed high-heeled mules to watch in the afternoon	 lying on the couch eating bonbons. In fact	 bonbons play a prominent role in the movie.<br /><br />The only reason I was able to watch to the end	 is that I finally was able to gaze at Keanu Reeves' dreamy face in almost every scene. In most of his films	 he moves too fast to get a good look. The only rapid action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini waving his hands with Latin emotionality - more Italian than Mexican	 really. <br /><br />The dialog is as stiff as wood. Unfortunately	 no bodices are ripped - the hero is disgracefully perfect-mannered and mild. The aristocratic warm-blooded old-world family cliche is as old as the hills. What does it matter if they are Irish or Italian or Mexican? This is a fairy story.<br /><br />I knew before the titles finished running that this would not be the movie I hoped for. The glowing grapes looked like the paragon of all food ads in Women's Day Magazine. I didn't see his name listed	 but the art director surely was Thomas Kinkade	 who paints the million dollar canvases of Irish cottages snuggled in fuchsias. This film was literally seen through rose-colored glasses. If you like dreamy pink and blue sky	 this film is for you! (The bonbons looked really good	 too!)"	0.0
"The Ancient Mariner is a truly classic piece of work	 as the original poem was/is. The context/setting with the old mariner himself is fine	 clear	 and without pretense. The artistic work that accompanies the reading of the poem fits perfectly the time/period of the setting and of the work itself	 carrying the audience into the period with a still	 yet moving accompaniment	 using excellent still-movement strategies only well conquered by the pre-MTV era producers and much less apparent in more current works. (MTV brought to television and video a static movement that races through	 often irrelevant cuts	 from theme to theme without forward movement and without clear relationships to theme or storyline.) The voice	 intonation and vitality of Redgrave's reading brings this touching poem to life with all its fear	 strife and pain. In addition	 the smooth movement of the video emphasizes the cadence and occasional monotone (in this case a positive mood under the theme of the story itself)of the author's rendition of the ancient mariner's sad and spooky tale. This is a must for any love of classic poetry	 the sea	 a tall tale	 that almost rings true	 and a story that has left a lasting impact on our world and culture. Who does not understand the meaning of an ""albatross""? or the concept of ""water	 water everywhere and not a drop to drink?"" A truly fine experience. Thank you Mr. DaSilva for bringing this to life for us	 never to be forgotten."	1.0
"When seeing this movie you should take notice to that it´s not a normal movie. It has no real story just characters	 a bunch of gangster characters who come together in a perfect harmony. The dialogue is wonderful	 you can just lay back and listen. The movie stands out thats why it´s hard to find a right way of describing it.<br /><br />Thats why the user comments on this movie is so mixed.<br /><br />I for one love the movie and recommend it to all who love one-liners and things that differ from the ""normal"". You can´t really put the finger on what´s so wonderful about it it´s just a comical world where gangsters rule. A place of love and danger. A movie that you can see more than one time."	1.0

"The Drug Years actually suffers from one of those aspects to mini-series or other kinds of TV documentaries run over and over again for a couple of weeks on TV. It's actually not long enough	 in a way. All of the major bases in the decades are covered	 and they're all interesting to note as views into post-modern history and from different sides. But it almost doesn't cover enough	 or at least what is covered at times is given a once over when it could deserve more time. For example	 the information and detail in part three about the whole process and business unto itself of shipping mass amounts of drugs (partly the marijuana	 later cocaine) is really well presented	 but there are more details that are kept at behest of how much time there is to cover.<br /><br />Overall though the documentary does shed enough light on how drugs	 pop-culture	 government intervention	 the upper classes and lower classes and into suburbia	 all felt the wave of various drugs over the years	 and the interplay between all was very evident. Nobody in the film- except for the possibility of small hints with the pot)- goes to endorse drugs outright	 but what is shown are those in archival clips about the honesty of what is at times fun	 and then tragic	 about taking certain drugs. The appearances of various staunch	 ridiculously anti-drug officials does hammer some points down hard- with even in such an overview of the drug cultures and America's connection as a whole- as there is really only one major point that is made a couple of times by one of the interviewees. The only way to really approach the issue of drugs is not 'just say no'	 because as the war on drugs has shown it is not as effective as thought. It is really just to come clean on all sides about all the drugs and the people who may be hypocritical about them (as	 for example	 oxycontin continues on in the marketplace).<br /><br />Is it with the great interest and depth of a Ken Burns documentary? No	 but for some summertime TV viewing for the young (i.e. my age) who will view a lot of this as almost ancient history despite most of it being no more than a generation ago	 as well as for the 'old' who can reflect some decades later about the great peaks	 careless times	 and then the disillusionment prodded more by the same media that years earlier propagated and advertised it. There are those who might find the documentary to be particularly biased	 which is not totally untrue	 but it does attempt to get enough different takes on the social	 political	 and entertainment conditions of drugs interweaving (for better or obvious worse) for enough of a fascinating view."	1.0
"The action in this movie beats Sunny bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar possess the superpowers of Leonidus in 300	 Neo in Matrix along with Spiderman and Superman. It is hilarious. Except for the typical Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor comedy I cannot see anything positive in this film. The story looks like the writer told his 10yr old son to write. The movie is so unreal that Anil Kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director. Except for the directors Tashan to make this movie there is no other Tashan. I regret wasting my money on this movie and I would not recommend it to anybody. 1/10 is the least I can give on IMDb or I would give it a zero."	0.0
"Seems that the cast should ensure at least an average movie. And so I sat down for 102 minutes of unbelief. Beside Ed Harris no-one seems to own the skills of acting. Even Sean Connery	 who I normally worship	 must have had an off-day during the entire filming of Just Case. Not once in during the whole movie one actor could convince me.<br /><br />This made this movie look cheap and unreal.<br /><br />The story makes up a little. It is thrilling	 and the plot is unexpected.<br /><br />Conclusion only watch this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do."	0.0
"I've seen all kinds of ""Hamlet""s. <br /><br />Kenneth Branagh's was most ambitious	 Mel Gibson's was quick and to the point	 Laurence Olivier's was the best - hands down. But now we come to Maximilian Schell's take on the Bard.<br /><br />For one	 this is a dubbed version of a German TV production of William Shakespeare's venerable chestnut. But if there's a slower	 more plodding	 more lethargic and worse-staged version out there somewhere	 it must have been acted at grade school-level. <br /><br />Having seen it on MST3K helps	 with Mike and the robots taking jolly good jabs at the old boy	 puncturing the profundity of black and white TV	 Shakespeare and the wisdom (?) of Germans acting out an English play and making it look like an Ingmar Bergman reject.<br /><br />Of course	 the best parts are the MST riffs. Best lines? ""I'm gonna unleash the Great Dane""	 ""I don't think so	 'breather'""	 ""Meet the Beatles""	 ""Hey	 Dad	 will you help me with my science project"" and	 my personal favorite	 during a party - ""Garrison Keillor's leaving Germany (YAAAY!!)"".<br /><br />But then there's Schell	 playing Shakespeare's greatest character much like a department store mannequin would	 only not as expressive. No doubt he's a great actor	 but here he comes off about as well as Paul Newman in ""The Silver Chalice"". Ever see that one? You GOTTA watch these two on a double-bill!<br /><br />In the end	 this is one instance where it's true that you're much better off to just read the book. At least the book isn't dubbed by Ricardo Montalban.<br /><br />One star only for this ""Hamlet""; ten stars	 naturally	 for the MST3K version.<br /><br />Good-night	 not-so-sweet prince."	0.0
"Beaudray Demerille(a weak Peter Fonda	 who also directed)	 an aging gambler	 wins young teen Wanda ""Nevada""(pretty	 but not talented Brooke Shields) in a poker game. Together the unlikely pair(of course)embark on a search for Indian gold in the Grand Canyon.<br /><br />That's the story and there really is no need to search for a deeper meaning in it. It just isn't there. The acting is very weak too	 which was quite a surprise given the fact that Peter Fonda was in the lead.<br /><br />If you're looking for something interesting in this film	 take a look at the nice scenery and some good looks of a young Brooke Shields. Her character however is so irritating(especially at the beginning)and dumb	 that she never quite comes off as sexy or appealing. Too bad	 but	 given the story	 I doubt anything more could be made of this. I wonder why Peter Fonda directed and starred in this film. He must have even talked his father(Henry Fonda)into a (useless) cameo in this ridiculous mess. Unfortunately	 this was their only film together.

"I saw this film first on my way home from Paris to Newark aboard Air France in August 1996. The film itself I believe is quite a masterpiece. It's the kind of film that people should be making. I still think Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors around. In this French film	 he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his zest for life until he across a Down Syndrome man who lives in an institution with other Down Syndrome patients. The actors including the actor who actually has Down Syndrome create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men. Daniel's life and ours changes forever with the Down Syndrome man. He realizes that life is not just work and not play but for the living and loving and that's what life should be all about. The ending is kind of silly though but I still think it's one of my favorite movies. It's enough to bring a tear to your eye."	1.0
"I could write a big enough comment on any one of the characters in Gundam Wing	 they could each lead the series with their internal conflicts. Instead we get 8 great leads that take us through 49 golden episodes of Anime bliss.<br /><br />It contains dialogue that you can roll around in your head for months... years	 and then go back to and derive new meaning from	 a masterpiece in script writing (even though it has the typical Anime trait of there being a disparity between subtitles and English dub). It has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views.<br /><br />The relationships between the cold unfeeling males and loving female characters is a stand alone aspect of this series. The relationship between Heero and Relena	 and Milliardo and Noin are joys to watch. The apparent rejection of the male is underpinned with an inner turmoil that makes the love (a word never mentioned in the series) of the women necessary for them in their harsh soldier environment. The women are chasing aspects of the men that we rarely	 if at all see	 which makes the leading men all the more enigmatic. It takes Heero all of the 49 episodes to show some caring	 but he gets there	 and when he does	 its a big pay off. <br /><br />And then there's the giant robot fighting. Fun to watch awesome sequences as good as any Hollywood epic fight scene. Any less clued up person would see giant robot fighting as a silly cartoon function for kids	 as has become clear when I'm trying to recommend this series to my friends	 but they're wrong. Many of the giant robot fights in Gundam Wing contain a hefty dose of pathos	 usually concerning young rebels fighting for what they believe in against an oppressive society making their beliefs obsolete.<br /><br />The constant shifts in tone and emphasis through each episode makes Gundam Wing impossible to be boring	 it is a captivating	 thought provoking study on the potential of the human mind and body."	1.0
"""House Of Games"" is definitely not without its flaws- plot holes	 stiff acting	 final scenes- but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head. ""House Of Games"" does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do. Of course	 this is not a huge feat given the fact that we're dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate. So it stands to reason that we never really know what's going on	 even though we think that we do. But that's what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game; a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities.<br /><br />It has a definite Hitchcock slant to it. The film draws on some similar themes found his 1964 effort ""Marnie""	 considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the Master's more thought-provoking works. One could easily consider the idea of Lindsay Crouse's character being the same as Tippi Hedrin's...ten year later perhaps. Both are strong-willed loners	 both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool. As Crouse's repressed	 up-tight character says	 ""What's life without adventure?"" Put your Reality Check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks!"	1.0
"After a slow beginning	 BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny film that had something positive to say. It wasn't one of Jim Carrey's best performances	 but he was still OK. Morgan Freeman was just right as God. Jennifer Aniston had some good moments. I miss Steve Correll on ""THE DAILY SHOW!""<br /><br />I like director Tom Shadyac's choices of movies. He also did LIAR LIAR	 PATCH ADAMS	 and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR. In all three of those and in Bruce Almighty	 he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him. A director who knows comedy	 can get the talent he gets	 and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with it is hard to find.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references. I only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie. My guess is that the first few drafts of the screenplay had more biblical references	 but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of offending people. That's too bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity.<br /><br />My Grade:<br /><br />7 out of 10"	1.0
"I guess this movie is a fitting tribute to the first Superman film	as it is just as crummy and painfully long as the original.<br /><br />After an opening scene consisting solely of murky intergalactic visuals	 the credits pay homage to the even-crummy-looking-for-their-time futuristic sweeping credits of the original Superman film.<br /><br />Then there is some more murky stuff. Ma Kent sees some kind of murky ruckus on the farm	 and spends a good portion of my life slowly walking up to some debris in the cornfield. Then Superman sneaks up on her and faints.<br /><br />Next we catch up with Lex Luthor in a scene about many murky close-ups of an old lady as she dies. We don't see Luthor's face until the end of the scene	 an early instance of the film's drive to leave no hackneyed stone unturned. Lex Luthor is a guy who doesn't like Superman because he is not human. Also	 he probably doesn't like humans either	 as the movie occasionally features some kind of plot about Lex Luthor planning to kill most of Earth's population.<br /><br />After a while	 Clark Kent shows up back at his old job (I forgot to mention	 he had been away on a five year trip where nothing happened). Then he finds out Lois Lane has an illegitimate kid and is dating Cyclops. It upsets him so much that he loses control of his super strength to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frame.<br /><br />At this point we see that Miss Lane is on some kind of jet attached to some kind of space shuttle. It is some kind of important event on account of it is on television. Then we learn that there are people in a control room monitoring this event. There are also people watching it on television and there are pilots in the cockpit. The film then reminds us that these people are involved by cutting between them for most of the summer.<br /><br />As the events leading up to the inevitable disaster started to build	 I excused myself to get a soda. I accidentally walked back into the wrong theater and watched that movie about Al Gore showing slides in its entirety. I tried to find my way back to Superman Returns	 but I somehow wandered into Prairie Home Companion	 which I watched twice in a row. Then it was time to stop messing around.<br /><br />I walked back into the first theater	 found my seat	 and looked up to see that the impending Lois Lane space shuttle disaster was almost upon us. Still	 it seemed to be taking forever	 so I wandered around the theater	 met a girl	 got married	 raised a son and sent him off to college. While attending my son's medical school graduation	 I remembered that I should probably check in on Superman Returns	 so I excused myself and raced back to the theater only to learn there was no need to hurry. It still took about another half hour before things went wrong for Space Shuttle Lane. When they did	 Superman saved everybody	 which was pretty cool.<br /><br />. And then there is a a subplot where Superman turns really creepy and starts stalking Lois Lane and her family with his x-ray vision and super-hearing. Then he tries to get her to cheat on Cyclops	 who seems like a good guy.<br /><br />Meanwhile	 Lex Luthor is involved in some kind of contest to display every possible generic villain behavior before the end of the movie. I forgot to bring my scorecard home with me (they give you one at the door)	 but I think he scored damn close to one hundred percent. I hope he wins the million dollars.<br /><br />At this point	 things start to gear up for the big murky finale. I think maybe the projector was broken	 on account of the movie seemed to be in some kind of loop for a while here. I remember seeing murky things growing out of the water	 Superman getting sick	 Superman getting better	 back to the murky things	 he's sick again	 no wait	 he's okay again.<br /><br />Then Lex Luthor unleashed his final bad guy move: yelling at his girlfriend a little bit.<br /><br />Then Superman died and came back to life. I thought the movie was over	 so I left.<br /><br />Ninety years later	 the nursing home where I lived felt a little chilly. I realized I left my sweatshirt back in the theater	 and I went to retrieve it. When I did	 I was slightly surprised to find that Superman Returns wasn't over yet. I tried to ask some of the viewers what I missed	 but most of them were only skeletons with long gray beards by now.<br /><br />I sat back in my old seat and watched as Lois Lane puttered around her house for a while. Then Superman showed up and started quoting the beginning of the movie	 and since I already saw that part I thought it was okay to leave.<br /><br />So that is my review of Superman Returns.<br /><br />Oh	 also	 if you like jokes about people eating dogs or jokes about one dog eating another dog	 you will love this movie. On account of there are two jokes like that in it."	0.0
"Somebody needs to send this Uli Lommel guy back to MOVIE SCHOOL. Who ever told him HE knew HOW to make a movie? Can just ANYBODY make movies these days? In the past	 it always REQUIRED TALENT before someone could make a movie. After watching this lame BTK movie and the others he's made	 it seems blatantly obvious that the poor guy has about as much business making movies as I DO. Actually I think even I could make better movies than Uli LAME-ALL. This movie has absolutely NOTHING to do with the BTK Killer	 other than the names of the victims and the killer. THAT'S IT. Where did this guy get the big idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other preposterous crap that's in the movie? This is a classic example of someone trying to lure people into watching their movie based on the term ""BTK"" because of the fame it has achieved. Absolutely pitiful. The only serial killer movie I would consider WORSE is that lame ""DAHMER"" movie. That kid smoked so many cigarettes it made me nauseous. Whoever made that one needs to be shot."	0.0
"This film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities	 it's like someone who has just passed there driving test and then pitting them in a formula 1 Grand Prix (not I might add	 the US Grand Prix as everyone might pull out due to dodgy tyres and you might just win)	 that is how far short this film falls. Now don't take this the wrong way	 I love B-Movies	 around half my collection is made of B-Movies but I don't think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film is.<br /><br />First of the story (for a B-Movie) isn't that bad	 it has potential there to make a B-Movie brand	 were not talking Friday 13th potential	 but potential none the less. But what really lets this film down is the acting	 at not one second do I believe anything	 it's like watching QVC except the presenters on QVC tend to have a heavier tan.<br /><br />In summary I'd like to say I've seen worse films	 but I can't."	0.0
"Lavish production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of Jane Austen's satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in provincial 18th Century England. Northam and Paltrow are a salutory mixture as friends who must pass through jealousies and lies to discover that they love each other. Good humor is a sustaining virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the accessability of the aged source material (which has been toned down a bit in its harsh scepticism). I liked the look of the film and how shots were set up	 and I thought it didn't rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the 80s and 90s do. Very good results."	1.0
"Of the elements that make this the best at this point	 I have to say #1 is Christine McIntire. Shemp's scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent. I imagine that	 as one poster suggested	 Christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene	 but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil	 to be smiling at Shemp's possibly dying.<br /><br />Another character who helps this stand out is the Goon. His look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goof-ball. Hardly a character I would choose to meet in a dark alley or	 for that matter anywhere. I would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this	 but hey	 when a short is this good	 who's going to complain. Not I."	1.0
"Jim McKay has made one of the best films you will see all year.The quiet simplicity of this film draws you in from the opening shot and never lets go.There is not one false note in the entire film.Not one.Everything works.The hand-held camera is never distracting and always where it should be.The three young ladies whose lives we follow are always real.There isn't a single beat where the audience is reminded we are looking at actresses performing a role.These are just real girls trying to find themselves.There is no political agenda	hidden or otherwise.This is cinema at its most basic	and although it will probably only be seen by a handful of movie-goers	it deserves a much wider release.A special hats off to Hugh Hefner for providing the film-makers with the grant money needed to get this important film made.I can't wait to see what Mr. McKay does next."	1.0
"I love the newer episodes with CJ and Grandad - I also liked the storyline with Kate falling for the principal. I want to find out what happens to Rory and Kerry and Bridget and the family next. I think CJ is very funny and I love his scenes with Grandad. I have always loved James Garner in everything he does	 and it is a credit to his acting that I never think of him as James Garner or Rockford in this series and totally believe in him as Kate's Dad. This family is so real and funny. It was terribly sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey died	 but as in real life these things happen and the way it was written into the series and dealt with was both funny and sad and always extremely sensitively and lovingly dealt with. But generally a very funny show with lots of laughs and fun."	1.0
"Working-class romantic drama from director Martin Ritt is as unbelievable as they come	 yet there are moments of pleasure due mostly to the charisma of stars Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both terrific). She's a widow who can't move on	 he's illiterate and a closet-inventor--you can probably guess the rest. Adaptation of Pat Barker's novel ""Union Street"" (a better title!) is so laid-back it verges on bland	 and the film's editing is a mess	 but it's still pleasant; a rosy-hued blue-collar fantasy. There are no overtures to serious issues (even the illiteracy angle is just a plot-tool for the ensuing love story) and no real fireworks	 though the characters are intentionally a bit colorless and the leads are toned down to an interesting degree. The finale is pure fluff--and cynics will find it difficult to swallow--though these two characters deserve a happy ending and the picture wouldn't really be satisfying any other way. *** from ****"	1.0
"When I was 16 I saw the documentary: ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"". I actually liked	 and believed in it for a couple of years. But then I grew up	 and began to think	 and when I had sought more information. This is: more info from reel sources	 and non-biased sources. When I started at university	 not so long ago	 i asked an assistant-professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories. What he said shocked me: He said that all those theories where lies. That baffled me	 I did not believe it first	 but then he presented evidence for his claims. He quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject: ""humans did not go to the moon"". The most outrages claim was that the Apollo-craft could not travel through the Van-Allen-radiation-Belt	 without the crew perishing from radiation. The truth is that the Americans use a secret aluminum-anti-radiation-alloy. It is not that well-known. And the exact specifications are a secret. And why is it a secret: Well	 why should they reveal it back then?? If they where in a space race with the Russians	 then it would be VERY dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation.<br /><br />And then there is the biggest evidence of all: The Moon Stones. When the Apollo-missions DID go to the moon	 they brought back many rocks from the moon	 to give to geologists and similar scientists	 who are documenting all things about the moon. These rocks and stones are IN FACT FROM THE MOON. Because: the internal basic elements	 which all matter consist of	 are also made of special isotopes	 that are different from quarry to quarry	 land to land	 and especially planet from planet. The isotopes of these rocks and stones have been Proved	 that they do not come from earth. The astronauts brought home HUNDREDS of Kilogram's of these rocks	 all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth	 and from the same planet. Ergo: The moon-landings where not fake. NASA did go to another planet: the moon	 though it is not a planet	 but a satellite to a planet	 a moon (duuh). These rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world. It has been proved: Humans did go to the moon - it is a fact	 pronto.<br /><br />But I do not worry: most conspiracy-theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated	 that is mostly why they do not know or lie about these facts. The fact remains: Humans did walk on the moon."	0.0
"I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this. In fact	 it's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi did.<br /><br />The film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time	 one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that's going on behind the walls of the stadium.<br /><br />It makes you feel like you are in the movie and you're one of the characters	 and while watching the movie	 as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the football match. You will feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie. It's gripping in a way that you wanted to see the ending	 you will want to find out the verdict	 you'll be dying to see what will happen to the girls.<br /><br />I like the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee. It's like venus VS mars	 it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran.<br /><br />This is the second movie of Jafar Panahi that I have seen (the first being Crimson Gold) and am looking forward to watching some more.<br /><br />Am already hooked with Iranian movies and this one is a must-see!"	1.0
"Acclaimed Japanese director Takashi Miike can't seem to get the wheels moving with this torpid thriller	 an adaptation of Yasushi Akimoto's book concerning an evil old woman (and child abuser!) who is part of a new urban legend: if your cell-phone rings with a strange tone--and you see the message 'One Missed Call'--you will replay the message only to hear your own final words before your death. Most successful part of the film is the trenchant satire of Reality TV cameras intruding on the future victims	 but the not-so-elaborate deaths (which include a hidden piece of red candy!) are disappointing and dispiriting. The frequent shots of ravaged dead bodies are actually displayed rather discreetly	 and this overall politeness may be the reason why the film is ultimately so staid. Hollywood predictably jumped on the far-fetched plot in 2008	 yet the U.S. version fared no better. NO STARS from ****"	0.0
"Wow. The only people reviewing this positively are the Carpenter apologists. I know a lot of those. The guys that'll watch John Carpenter squat on celluloid and pinch out a movie and proclaim it a masterwork of horror. This ""movie"" is utter crap. It looks and sounds like a porno (good lord	 the soundtrack is awful...)	 and has sub-par porn acting	 which is shocking	 because normally Ron Perlman is really a very good actor. I honestly have no idea what Carpenter was thinking when making this. Most likely ""Beans	 beans	 beans.."" until somebody fed him and rolled him up into a blanket for the day... They say nothing about the abortion debate whatsoever	 when they could have had a very interesting central theme (how do religious zealot anti-abortionists feel when it's the devil's baby?) but instead they chose to have Ron Perlman and his terribly acted kids kill a bunch of people and have the horribly cast doctors try to calm the hysterically bad pregnant girl. Not a single person from this episode or what have you should come away unscathed. It's just awful. Like	 Plan 9 From Outerspace awful. Like	 good god please would somebody turn it off before I soil myself awful. Try watching this and The Thing in the same day and your mind will implode."	0.0
"The movie seemed to appeal me because of the new type of Pokemon Celebi. But the plot was out of course and didn't have as an interest as the other movies. It was a waste of money and time. The same corny humor and cliche bad guys. The movie was of no use to make if you wanted to make Pokemon famous. The movie should better not associated with animes such as Dragonballz	 Digimon	 or Yu-Gi-Oh. The drawing and settings are of no level rising to the standards of original anime. It is a shame even to talk about this movie. I bet Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on Pokemon. Digimon is more of an anime and doesn't fall anywhere close to Pokemon.It's second movie is coming out late 2002."	0.0
"This is one of the best movies. It is one of my favorites. A movie with good acting. The story is very sensitive and touching. Good camera work also.<br /><br />The names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the American Star list. However	 they give equal or better performances than the top of the list.<br /><br />It is such a pleasure to see a movie about true love	 romance	 friendship without having to endure watching someone having to kick-box their way to save the world.<br /><br />If you don't like this movie then you have no heart or feelings. Then go watch a sports movie. There is no killing or horror here. See the movie. It is a must. TH"	1.0
"This was a great book and the possibilities for a truly great film were definitely there. But the casting decisions completely wrecked the movie. Hanks is a great actor to be sure	 but lacks the smarmy	 morally ambivalent characteristics needed for the lead role. Jeff Daniels would have been my choice.<br /><br />Putting Melanie Griffiths in	 for eye candy reasons	 is understandable	 but again	 she did not portray the depth or ambivalence	 so need to pull this off.<br /><br />This movie is a great example of how every decision	 even those early on in the movie production can make or break a file."	0.0
"With Ralph Bakshi most of his films appear to be like two-edged swords. You'll get something awesome out of it but only if you put up with the silly and the unnecessarily cheezy. The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of the story which perhaps didn't always shine in the animation department.<br /><br />Fire and Ice is a great achievement from Bakshi from an animation point of view. The rotoscoping is a lot more detailed and the animation has a vibrant look to it. You still get some of the dull still-cells and slightly blurred background paintings but on the over-all the look has definitely gotten better since Bakshi's last fantasy epic. The animation has almost a realistic-naturalistic style to it	 and unlike in LOTR where this style was often at odds with the actual content	 here it enhances the film's unique atmosphere.<br /><br />Unfortunately the film fails to create a meaningful story out of its simple setting and in fact most of the characters' motivations are pretty blurred. Lorn and Tigra are easy cases but even the main villain Necron was difficult to follow not to mention That Guy with Furry Face Mask (also known as just 'That Guy'). Even though most of the voice actor's were appropriate	 there are some odd quirks in the audio-department and Tigra especially sounds really terrible whenever she's screaming.<br /><br />However	 I believe the film's inherent entertainment value outweighs its unnecessarily silly execution of the plot-line. The scant clad of the characters is something you'll never get over but it helps you remind yourself that perhaps this film isn't even intended to be taken too seriously. It's still a hella cool and really funny."	1.0
"King of Masks (Bian Lian in China) is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film. Winner of 16 awards from around the world	 this film based on a true story centers on Wang Bianlian	 a street performer in 1930s China who is growing older but has no heir to pass on his art of face-change opera. He has a unique talent of quickly changing masks in performance	 and no one knows how he does it. He has a longing desire to have a grandson	 as his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir. We then go to the streets	 and see that people are selling their children because they can't afford to take care of them: some are even begging to take their daughters for free	 because daughters are not worth much in this society. Wang Bianlian's story goes on from there.<br /><br />The film was so astonishingly good	 the acting was amazing	 and the issues were so weighty and well-addressed. There is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place	 no one wants a little girl. Also interesting to note is that the famed opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the Living Bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman	 and while he is famous and well-respected	 he regards himself as something low	 a half woman. As we go further into the film	 the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution for it	 the brutality and corruption of the military and police	 and the helplessness and lack of power any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions.<br /><br />This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life	 and Xu Zhu	 the actor who plays Wang Bianlian	 presents yet another beautiful performance."	1.0
"I found this show really late at night	 and gave it a try. It's a refreshing change from the other kinds of things shown late at night	 if you catch my drift. Its simplicity of values and sweetness of hearts helps remind me of the way friendships were as children. It's something I indulge in whenever I find it on (which is rare	 maybe I should actually check the listings! haha)..... and the tension between Joe and Nick is so cute. Like any good chick flick	 you really get emotionally involved in the characters. Good ol' Louisa May Alcott still inspiring good stories :) So apparently I must complete 10 lines of text in order for my opinion to be valid	 so I guess I'll tell you a bit more. The kids are played by talented actors and actresses	 and the settings are lovely and nature-filled -- another thing you don't see much on television. I hope everyone gives it a shot. I recognize and am fully aware that it's sappy	 but it's good heart. Like I said before	 it's refreshing."	1.0
"Well	 I can honestly say that this is the first time that I experienced a film that had literally no meat or potatoes in it. The entire film felt like it was just the salad with no main course. The story line was fallible and laughable	 the characters were one-dimensional	 the realism was out the window	 and the animation was done by four-year olds. Does that cover it? I have never been more embarrassed for a concept in my entire life. I have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character	 but from the looks of the other reviews I am not off base with my observation.<br /><br />To begin	 the story moved too quickly. For someone new to this character and situations	 I needed more built into creating the reasons instead of finding the solution. I have seen other Anime (if you could call this one an Anime) that do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them. There was nothing set aside for Lady Death. In a few short scenes	 we see her train with Cremator and instantly become this aggressive she-beast of Hell. This was hard for me to swallow	 considering moments before she was introduced as this weak and feeble woman controlled by her father. Suddenly	 she is immersed with hatred and can do battle with an existence that has been around for millions of years. This was absurd. The presentation of Lady Death was poor	 to say the least. I felt as if she was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind. For me	 it just didn't work. She was nothing more than eye-candy for prepubescent boys wanting to ogle the mass quantities of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest when training with Cremator. Oh	 I felt sick just watching her. The same goes for the character of Cremator. Who was this random person? The explanation they gave wasn't enough	 and instead I was left with more incoherent babbling than actual development. It is a very sad day in Hell when we forgo characters to show more violence and action	 especially in an animated feature.<br /><br />Next	 there was Lucifer himself. Let me just say that I think I could do battle with the King of Hell and survive. He was weak	 his voice was laughable	 and he just didn't represent the image that I had in my mind. It was as if Disney was in control and wanted to make him semi-PC. He lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that Lucifer embodies. He was not the ruler of Hell	 but instead just a lackey that had a bigger place to live. Speaking of living or dying	 how can you die again in Hell? That was a concept that definitely needed more explanation. Most of the characters were worrying about dying	 when they didn't even consider the option that they were already dead. That is how they got to Hell. I think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me. I didn't quite capture the notion that your soul was still in a solid body in Hell	 but that could just be me or maybe it was because there was NO DEVELOPMENT in this story. There was nothing built	 just preparing.<br /><br />The battle sequences were hysterically bad. The animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early 90s. There was nothing impressive about the way that this film was drawn. Why are we	 America	 so behind on animation? It is huge in Asia	 and it is creeping in hardcore here because we keep making films like Lady Death that do not challenge or use any part of imagination. We are cheap	 and this film shows it.<br /><br />Overall	 this film was bad. The animation coupled with the horrendous voice work was cheap. I had head somewhere that this film as in production for a long time	 which is hard to understand because I think I could have made this film on my credit card. The production was horrendous as well as the story. Nothing was developed	 leaving huge gaping plot holes that nearly everyone fell into. The strength of the characters was missing	 and nothing was explained. I wasted my time with this one and would like to warn others so that when Death does come	 you don't find yourself in my state and regretting the fact that you wasted 80 minutes on this piece of garbage.<br /><br />BLAH! <br /><br />Grade: * out of *****"	0.0

"Well-done ghost story that will give you the creeps and some pretty fair scares along the way. The story unfolds slowly	 building atmosphere all the way until you're ready to see the woman in black.

"The film is almost laughable with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters teaming up as the mothers of convicted murderers. With the horrible notoriety after the trial	 the two women team up and leave N.Y. for California in order to open and song and dance studio for Shirley Temple-like girls.<br /><br />From the beginning	 it becomes apparent that Reynolds has made a mistake in taking Winters with her to California. Winters plays a deeply religious woman who increasingly seems to be going off her rocker. <br /><br />To make matters worse	 the women who live together	 are receiving menacing phone calls. Reynolds	 who puts on a blond wig	 is soon romanced by the wealthy father of one of her students	 nicely played by Dennis Weaver.<br /><br />Agnes Moorehead	 in one of her last films	 briefly is seen as Sister Alma	 who Winters is a faithful listener of.<br /><br />The film really belongs to Shelley Winters. She is heavy here and heaviness seemed to make her acting even better. Winters always did well in roles testing her nerves.<br /><br />The ending is of the macabre and who can forget Winters at the piano banging away with that totally insane look?"	0.0
"Contrary to most other comments about ""Syriana"" on the IMDb web-site	 I and my family found watching this film on DVD at home a complete waste of time and space.<br /><br />In short	 this was a film based on a script whose writer was being too clever by far. Rather than trying to tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear manner	 it was assumed that constantly throwing mostly vague and hard to connect with each other 30-second vignettes of different story-lines from a dozen or so ""story-lines"" at the audience made for great and clear viewing. No	 sir	 it does not. What does make for great viewing is total clarity	 precision	 plots and story-lines - and characterisations - which have a beginning	 a middle	 and an end.<br /><br />This kind of cinematic presentation - akin to the Dim Sum experience in a Chinese restaurant - is pretentious and unintelligent in the extreme.<br /><br />Thank goodness	 then	 for the TV and DVD presentations of the Hollywood and British film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s whose writers	 director	 and actors knew the value of clear story telling	 diction	 and acting that meant something.<br /><br />This is one DVD that this family will not be sitting through again."	0.0
"Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) in his FBI office. He claims to have information about a serial killer chased by FBI. When Agent Doyle arrives in the office	 he tells him that the serial killer is indeed his dead brother. Agent Doyle requests some evidence	 and the man tells the story of his life	 since his childhood. They were a simple family of three: his widow father Meiks (Bill Paxton)	 his brother and himself. One night	 his father gathers the two brothers and tells them that an angel of God had just visited him and assigned his family to destroy demons. What happens next is one of the most scary movie I have ever seen. <br /><br />I watched this movie four months ago on VHS	 and yesterday I watched again	 now on DVD. Although being a low-budget movie	 the screenplay is sharp	 with no flaw. The cast is outstanding	 but I would like to highlight the performance of Matt O'Leary as the young Felton. It is a very difficult and complex role to be performed by a young teenager. The direction of Bill Paxton is remarkable. There is no explicit violence in this horror movie. A great debut behind the camera. I regret the Brazilian title of this movie: 'A Mão do Diabo' (The Devil's Hand'). If at least it were 'The God's Hand'	 it might be acceptable. But calling this movie as 'the devil's hand' is indeed ridiculous. Brent Hanley	 the screenwriter	 did not deserve such a lack of respect from the Brazilian distributor. This film is highly recommended. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""A Mão do Diabo"" (""The Devil's Hand"")"	1.0
"My wife and I thought that with this cast and director	 the movie would have to be at least worth watching. We were wrong. In fact	 we gave up on it after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford	 Young and Tone are British but speak with American accents was	 for me	 impossible to get past -- hard to believe this is England when no one talks with a British accent. There is zero chemistry between Crawford and anyone	 and to echo a previous comment	 the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly declare their love for one another without any reason is ludicrous. There is no reason to care about any of the characters	 which is why we threw in the towel halfway through. I found it hard to believe that Hawks directed this	 as none of the actors spoke with the trademark Hawksian rat-a-tat delivery. So save your time	 and skip this one."	0.0
"To me	 the final scene	 in which Harris responds to the press corp	 is worthy of viewing this intelligent and timeless slice of politics(especially the campaign phase). If only the ""real-life"" pols would respond in the intelligent	 articulate manner as did Mr Harris	then the arrogant	 self-serving members of the press would perhaps think twice before surfacing irrelevant	 confrontational ""garbage"" that has absolutely nothing to do with a candidates abilities to effectively handle the challenges of the office for which he/she is pursuing."	1.0
"Although I had seen ""Gymkata"" in a theater way back in '85	 I couldn't remember anything of the plot except for vague images of Kurt Thomas running and fighting against a backdrop of stone walls and disappointment regarding the ending.<br /><br />After reading some of the other reviews I picked up a copy of the newly released DVD to once again enter the world of Gymkata.<br /><br />It turns out this is one of those films produced during the '80s that would go directly to video today. The film stars champion gymnast Kurt Thomas as Jonathan Cabot	 recruited out of the blue to infiltrate the nation of ""Parmistan"" to enter and hopefully win ""The Game	"" a suicidal bloodsport sponsored by the Khan who encourages his people by yelling what sounds like ""Yak Power."" The goal of the mission involves the Star Wars defense system. Jonathan is trained in the martial arts by Princess Rubali	 who never speaks or leaves the house. Once trained tries to blend in with the locals by wearing a bright red sweater with dashes of blue and white. Needless to say Cabot finds himself running and fighting for his life along the stone streets of Parmistan	 on his way to a date with destiny	 and the Game.<br /><br />Star	 Kurt Thomas was ill served by director Robert Clouse	 who it looks like was never on the set. The so called script is just this side of incompetent. See other reviews for the many howlers throughout. The town of crazies has a few good moments	 but is ultimately ruined by bad editing. The ending...meh. Still there's the germ of a good action adventure here. A Hong Kong version with more visceral action and faster pace might even be pretty good."	0.0
"I can't believe I waste my time watching this garbage! I did because Leonard Maltin gave it an ""AA"" rating	 and for TV movies this is usually a reliable indicator of some quality entertainment.<br /><br />The acting was OK	 but whoever wrote it should be forever denied access to any medium of communication. The plot is ludicrous	 the motivations of the ""bad guys"" totally absent	 and the various family interactions silly and shallow. For example	 Dad preaches that violent reaction to aggression is BAD	 but he turns out to be an ""admirable"" person NOT because of his ""ignore the idiots"" philosophy	 but because he's pretty good with his fists...<br /><br />The ONLY message I was able to glean from this pap was that the nuclear family is Good and alternate living arrangements are Bad.

"How can the viewer rating for this movie be just 5.4?! Just the lovely young Alisan Porter should automatically start you at 6 when you decide your rating.

"I had fun watching this movie	 mainly due to Simon Pegg	 who has quickly become a solid box office draw for comedy films.<br /><br />He is hired from his dead end London publishing job by big shot NYC media mogul Jeff Bridges	 as a writer	 for one of his celebrity rags.<br /><br />After paying his dues	 he makes it into the higher echelons of celebrity writing hackdom (the ""seventh room"")	 where he gets to be a minor celebrity himself. The storyline is very funny	 and Gillian Anderson puts in an impressive supporting role as a cutthroat publicity agent.<br /><br />Along the way to success	 he finds the true meaning of love	 etc.<br /><br />The formulaic plot aside	 the movie was very funny	 mainly due to Simon Pegg	 Jeff Bridges	 and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was good as the love interest. The rest of the supporting cast did its job well.<br /><br />This was a good comedy & well worth checking out at the theaters."	1.0
"This movie deserved better It's great fun	 has some wonderful jokes and sight gags	 some in-stuff for the ""Geeks"" amongst us (And we know who we are)	 and the effects are indeed effectual. Watching Paul Reubens fart in the face of an Academy Award winner is worth the price of admission alone. I never read the comics series before I saw the movie	 but have since. as good as they are	 I still recommend MM the film.

It's only 5 bucks and some change at your local Wal-Mart. You'll thank me. Really you will. Oh	 and Ms. Garafolo is in it. THAT ALONE makes it watch-worthy"	1.0
"In São Paulo	 the upper middle class teenagers Cristiano	 Chico and Gabriel have just joined the university and on the eve of the opening class	 they go to a party with drugs and booze. On the next day	 after their classes	 the date of Cristiano in the previous night comes to his house and the three friends rape the girl. The girl dies	 they panic and decide to get rid off the body	 but Cristiano's mother arrives	 startles with Gabriel and rolls the staircase	 breaking her neck. The trio decides to dump and burn the corpses in a garbage landfill	 but along the night other tragedies happen.<br /><br />The polemic and shameful ""Cama de Gato"" is an overrated pretentious crap about alienation of the youth	 and is certainly the worst Brazilian movie that I have seen along many years. The shallow	 tragic and dark story is actually a black humor comedy of bad taste. The screenplay is not funny	 with stupid lines and dialogs	 and boring	 manipulative and silly footages with interviews with morons teenagers in the beginning and in the end. The acting is terrible	 apparently with many improvisations	 but no talent	 and I was disappointed with presence of the promising Caio Blat in this trash. The camera	 framing	 cinematography and edition are amateurish and of very low quality. The sound is awful and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are speaking (probably it is a plus	 since this flick sucks). The gang bang is very realistic and used to promote this mediocre movie in a very poor marketing of sex-exploitation. My vote is one (awful).<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Cama de Gato"" (""Bed of the Cat"")"	0.0
"There are laughs in this film	 that is for sure. Michael Keaton is a talent and he used to be funny (before he decided he was a serious actor). However	 what bothers me so much about this film	 is how unlikable practically all of the characters are. Other than the main two leads	 everybody is a jerk. I mean	 these small town losers are about as uncouth as you can get. You just watch and think	 man	 these losers should be unemployed. Moreover	 the American factory worker is portrayed as a lazy and ungrateful slob. It made me wonder if this film was made by Japanese nationalists. Oh sure	 in the end they all come together as one	 but I just did not enjoy the trip to get there."	0.0
"Oh if only I could give this rubbish less than one star! There were two mildly amusing parts in the whole film and that is it! one was where a line or two from the song Don't Worry	 Be Happy was sung by the slugs and the other was where Roddy fell of the toilet roll and landed with his feet and legs apart so that everything else he landed on on the way down hit him in the groin. That is it there was nothing more amusing than that	 at least not for me anyway! Doctornappy2 is not right in saying 'Fans of the completely terrible ""Shrek"" might enjoy	 but ""Wallace & Gromit"" fans will probably turn away in disgust.' As I loved Shrek 1 2 and 3 and I also love Wallace and Gromit. You see what it boils down to is that if an animation is done extremely well then it is definitely worth watching	 this however was about as far from done well as you can possibly get! The continuity mistakes were too big in number. Some were pointed out by the makers of this site others were not. I won't point out all of the others	 but here are a few more to see: When the young daughter leaves at the start of the film the catch to the cage door comes down and the hook part of it that is on the right clearly goes back around behind the round knob thus effectively making sure Roddy would not be able to get out and yet he does just by simply kicking at it. At one point the ruby falls down Roddy's back and gets pushed straight up into the the air by Rita all the while the ship is moving forwards. In the next scene Roddy has caught it again. This is impossible. Seeing as how the ship is moving forwards the only place when the ruby was ejected out from under the back of Roddy's shirt the only place it could have landed was in the water not in Roddy's hand. There was a third one I wanted to point out but for now I have forgotten it.<br /><br />Too many	 for want of a better word	 'jokes' were repeated in one way or another	 there was not enough time to establish any sort of connection with any of the characters	 the characters were hollow	 shallow and empty	 and the whole film left you wanting....wanting to watch 85 minutes of anything else! Paint drying or grass growing are two superb options!"	0.0
"First than anything	 I'm not going to praise Iñarritu's short film	 even I'm Mexican and proud of his success in mainstream Hollywood.<br /><br />In another hand	 I see most of the reviews focuses on their favorite (and not so) short films; but we are forgetting that there is a subtle bottom line that circles the whole compilation	 and maybe it will not be so pleasant for American people. (Even if that was not the main purpose of the producers) <br /><br />What i'm talking about is that most of the short films does not show the suffering that WASP people went through because the terrorist attack on September 11th	 but the suffering of the Other people.<br /><br />Do you need proofs about what i'm saying? Look	 in the Bosnia short film	 the message is: ""You cry because of the people who died in the Towers	 but we (The Others = East Europeans) are crying long ago for the crimes committed against our women and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you"".<br /><br />Even though the Burkina Fasso story is more in comedy	 there is a the same thought: ""You are angry because Osama Bin Laden punched you in an evil way	 but we (The Others = Africans) should be more angry	 because our people is dying of hunger	 poverty and AIDS long time ago	 and nobody pay attention to us like the whole world has done to you"".<br /><br />Look now at the Sean Penn short: The fall of the Twin Towers makes happy to a lonely (and alienated) man. So the message is that the Power and the Greed (symbolized by the Towers) must fall for letting the people see the sun rise and the flowers blossom? It is remarkable that this terrible bottom line has been proposed by an American. There is so much irony in this short film that it is close to be subversive.<br /><br />Well	 the Ken Loach (very know because his anti-capitalism ideology) is much more clearly and shameless in going straight to the point: ""You are angry because your country has been attacked by evil forces	 but we (The Others = Latin Americans) suffered at a similar date something worst	 and nobody remembers our grief as the whole world has done to you"".<br /><br />It is like if the creative of this project wanted to say to Americans: ""You see now	 America? You are not the only that have become victim of the world violence	 you are not alone in your pain and by the way	 we (the Others = the Non Americans) have been suffering a lot more than you from long time ago; so	 we are in solidarity with you in your pain... and by the way	 we are sorry because you have had some taste of your own medicine"" Only the Mexican and the French short films showed some compassion and sympathy for American people; the others are like a slap on the face for the American State	 that is not equal to American People."	1.0
"I vaguely remember Ben from my Sci-Fi fandom days of the '60s	 I was doing several interviews & bios of obscure actors/actresses	 most notably Ben	 actress Fay Spain	 and Jody Fair	 who played Angela in 1961's The Young Savages. Ben was one of the people at a low-key Sci-Fi con in Chicago	 about 1970	 when I had a nice chat with him and his ""career"" and life. All these were published in some now-long-forgotten fanzine of the day. Wish I still had copies of those interviews	 but time marches on	 and any of those people surely wouldn't' remember me at all so many years later. Ben was a really nice fellow	 ekeing out a living (The cons of those days didn't even pay their guest	 unless	 of course they were big-name stars	 and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollars	 at most!

"Michelle Rodrigez was made for this movie	 when I first saw her in Fast and the Furious. You could tell that she was a tough woman. With this movie	 she has not only proven her acting	 but shows no fear and is tough like she should be in this movie. She is more a bad girl and that's what I like about her. This movie is about a troubled girl	 living the life as a tom boy and getting in constant trouble with school and family. As she gets interested in her brothers training to be a boxer	 she decides to go after her love to fight and asks her brothers trainer to train her. Even though they don't think she has the potential	 they get to be shown proven wrong.<br /><br /> I think this movie was a little slow at the ending	 but was well done. It shows	 that people can do anything even if they don't think you have the potential. I recommend it to be seen."	1.0
"I didn't think it could be done	 but something has come along and replaced Open House- a low budget horror about someone killing over the high price of real estate- as the worst film I've ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet life.<br /><br />It was touted as the best film in Montreal's most recent film festival	 which leads me to believe that every other entry must consist of blank-wall shots accompanied by people reading gloomy poetry.<br /><br />Watching this movie was like a little slice of Hell. It's from Austria	 and it attempts to stumble along in the footsteps of Short Cuts and Blue Velvet- scenes about various characters living in a suburban area with a dark underbelly. There's the fat dog owner and his fat maid wife who stripteases for him	 the skinny divorcee whose wife still lives with him in a house that includes the untouched room of his dead child	 the über-annoying woman hitchhiker who recites top ten lists... The list goes on. Forever. Much like the two hours plus I spent in that theatre.<br /><br />Yes	 the characters interact	 but not in a clever or interesting or even relevant way. I couldn't say if they were any good as actors	 as	 according to the subtitles	 they were given lines that were the Austrian equivalent of ""You are so lame!"" They certainly didn't have to learn many	 as each repeated his or her same lines at least three times in a scene.<br /><br />This is no Gummo	 or any of the aforementioned movies. There is no art to discover	 and nothing to dwell on afterwards except maybe whether or not you should change your ""never walk out during a movie"" policy (which quite a few older couples did during a random orgy scene- and if that sounds appetizing	 it's not	 unless you're one of few who doesn't find the idea of your parents having sex- and with a few local middle-aged couples	 to boot- revolting).<br /><br />This movie was offensive to me. Not the flabby nudity	 not the cringe-inducing soundtrack	 not the shockless scenes involving guns. I was offended that someone actually spent money to make this when there are capable writers and filmmakers out there looking for funding. I was offended that someone from out of town might have gone to see Dog Days and come out wondering if that was the best us Montrealers could find. Most of all	 I was offended that	 somehow	 the people involved with the festival duped everyone into believing that the emperor had a gorgeous and mesmerising new outfit when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as the fat maid wife doing a striptease.<br /><br />"	0.0
"I saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show. I still vividly remember the film	 especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought Taylor was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid	 almost dull leading man type	 and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks. This film	 however	 proved what an interesting actor he could be. He did not get enough roles like this during his long career. This is his best performance. He is totally believable in a truly villainous role. From what I have read	 he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of roles. He basically would just do what MGM gave him. This film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles. The other thing I remember about this film is how annoying Lloyd Nolan's character was. Nolan was a great actor	 but this character really aggravated me. The last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years. This film is definitely worth a look."	1.0
"Student Seduction finds Saved By The Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and attracting the attention of young and hunky Corey Sevier. Speaking for myself I can truthfully say that no teachers save one ever did anything for me hormonally back when I was a student. That was a Ms. Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School. Even as a young gay kid	 I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.<br /><br />Corey being the hotty he is	 is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not. The fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces that belief. He's flunking chemistry which is what Berkley teaches and to keep his GPA up she agrees to tutor	 but believe no more. <br /><br />So when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it's damaging to his ego. When Berkley goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police	 the cops who are keeping in mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau just don't believe here. Sevier's parents have the wherewithal to get a good publicity spin on this for their boy.<br /><br />Student Seduction which is a misnomer of a title if there ever was one is trash all the way. After the beating that Berkley took for Showgirls this TV film was not an upward career move."	0.0
"It is first and foremost a chick flick	 it is a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between the two. This particular movie has the addition of some pretty sweet fight scenes	 I don't think any wires were used or if they were they weren't flat out blatant. It isn't a terribly complicated movie so it easy on the brain	 no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning	 pretty simple	 good chemistry between the leads	 and a fun watch. I'd like it if they made brought out the full potential of the girls looks just once cause she can be amazingly cute	 but throughout the movie they keep it low key kind of pretty. I'd watch it again...with a girl."	1.0
"Well	 I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy thinking it would be mindless gory fun. That's what it is	 without the fun. This film truly is mindless	 it is absent of any plot or character development	 or any sort of storyline. The basic problem with this movie is the kills and gore. Basically	 every kill looks EXACTLY the same. ZOmbies ripping someone apart. Yeah	 that's okay	 but you need some original kills too. I mean it got really lame	 every kill looked exactly the same	 filmed exactly the same way. Thats what killed me. I love gore	 and the gore in this film did nothing for me. It was just boring. No storyline	 just the same lame scene over and over again with a different person. I wanted to like this movie	 too. I love shot on video gore movies...like Redneck Zombies. But I couldn't kid myself. This film has it's good points	 but none of those are in the film. I understand that many of the ""zombies"" helped out with the flood and there were like over 100 zombies	 which is pretty cool how they got so many people involved and helped out in the world.

"OK	 my girlfriend and I rented the DVD and about 30 minutes into the movie	 we'd exchanged a lot of ""ehhh	 what IS this movie about and more importantly	 do I care to find out what it ends with"" glances and decided we either needed drugs to keep us interested in the ""plot"" or just end the pain right there and then and watch something else.

"Yes	 I was lucky enough to see the long-running original production of Michael Bennett's hit musical. It was an amazing experience and I paid to see the movie when it hit theatres back in 1985. It is awful. Almost everything fails. First off	 Attenborough (a fine actor	 a good director with the right material) is a sorry choice - almost as bad as when John Huston was hired to mangle ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - they chop up the songs and the CASTING!!! They are awful - the power of the play was these dancers - these hungry	 talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chance - you couldn't take your eyes off of them. But this cast just gets by dancing	 does a ""nice"" job singing but none of them spark one bit. In fact	 look up the cast on IMDb - none of them really went on to do anything much. (OK	 OK	 Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). So this cinema trainwreck does not capture for one second the magic	 the desperation	 the passion of the stage musical. A total strike-out! (But even though they try to smother the music - the great music still rises up at times and reminds people how great the score was)."	0.0
"""Fred Claus"" somehow avoids becoming this year's ""The Santa Clause"" by at least having a bit more amusing moments than that Tim Allen starrer	 but it doesn't mean that it's got enough going for it that's worth a trip to the theater.<br /><br />As holiday movies go	 it's contrived and sentimental. But actually	 that could be the least of one's concern as ""Fred Claus	"" boasting of having David Dobkin (""Shanghai Knights	"" ""The Wedding Crashers"") at the helm	 contains virtually nary a genuinely funny moment as it clumsily treads the line between a boorish Vince Vaughn vehicle and a fuzzy Christmas film. In the end	 it amounts to not much of both. And with a cast that comprises of Paul Giamatti	 Kevin Spacey	 Rachel Weisz	 and Kathy Bates	 all the more it leaves one disappointed.<br /><br />Vaughn plays Fred	 Nick's (Giamatti) older and estranged brother	 who once upon a time	 left him and their parents (Bates and Trevor Peacock) after having had enough of enduring his parents' favoritism of his younger sibling. Nick grows up to be Santa Claus (and as the voice-over tells us	 time freezes on you and your family when you become a saint)	 while Fred becomes a Yuletide-jaded repo man in Chicago who's having a hard time remembering his girlfriend Wanda's (Weisz) birthday.<br /><br />He runs in trouble with the law and had to call his younger brother (who eerily looks at least a decade older than him) to bail him out of jail. Nick agrees but only if Fred agrees to help out on the toy-wrapping business up in the North Pole. Fred reluctantly agrees but his cynicism clashes with Santa and the elves' perpetually cheery nature	 even as an efficiency expert (Spacey) is checking on the toy factory operations	 only too happy to have the whole Arctic operations shut down if things fail.<br /><br />The film	 as said	 does have its moments	 but the padded running length stretches them thin across its duration. In between are piles of Christmas film clichés that were handled better in	 say	 ""Elf"" and the attempts at sentimentality are as endearing as last year's fruitcake.<br /><br />Vaugn	 as usual	 brings on his coarse charm to the table	 but the neutered script of Dan Fogelman keeps him from REALLY doing his thing. Giamatti	 underneath the bad fat suit	 brings a jolly old charm to his iconic character	 but unfortunately	 has to play second fiddle to Fred. Spacey brings his game face	 but his turns usually end as unfunnily vapid.<br /><br />Ultimately	 ""Fred Claus"" becomes a forgettable film that falls below what those involved in it deserve. Sure	 there are worse ways to start the season at the cinema	 but there are certainly far better ways."	0.0

"A serious comedy. Ross Hunter-produced movie version of the French play ""Les Joies de la famille"" (later Americanized as ""A Very Rich Woman"") is plush	 well cast	 occasionally funny...and unfortunately timeless. A wealthy California widow	 who appears to be frittering away her money	 is railroaded by her two grown	 greedy daughters	 both of whom are afraid Mama Rosie is carelessly spending their inheritance. The whole issue of a vital--but aged--woman sent to a rest home against her will	 and later having to prove herself sane in a court hearing	 is touchy material for a comedy (and to his credit	 director David Lowell Rich doesn't overload the picture with crass gags or obvious sentiment). Some of the humor is a little broad and doesn't work	 yet Rosalind Russell understands the gravity inherent in this scenario and never hits a false note. Sandra Dee is also good as Rosalind's granddaughter	 and James Farentino is very charming as a young lawyer. The movie has so much to say about the importance of our elderly	 and the ways in which they choose to spend their remaining time	 that the seriousness of ""Rosie!""'s theme almost gets lost in the rush to a happy ending. The picture leaves you smiling--and at the same time wondering how many older ladies there are who were never quite so lucky. *** from ****"	1.0
"As a 90 minute experience	 it is not up to the standard of `Drive'	 as the actors clearly learnt their trade at the `Who Am I?' academy	 while the action sequences are generally no better than those in the superb Mark Dacascos beat 'em-up. However	 those who enjoyed `Drive'	 (and I thought it was wonderful!)	 will undoubtedly enjoy this too. You certainly won't rewind back to the start and watch it all again	 but you will definitely flick back to some of the action scenes for a long time to come.<br /><br /> It is refreshing to see that the art of quality fight choreography is still being practiced	 even if not in Hong Kong	 and I would love to see what these guys could do with the budgets	 time and respect afforded to the likes of Yuen Woo-ping and Corey Yuen Kuei. If you sit through the first half hour and aren't sent crazy by the atrocious dialogue then you are in for a treat. Bosch is magnificent	 and can really bust a move with some magnificent acrobatics	 kicks and simple acts of bravery.<br /><br /> If you are fortunate enough to be within 500 miles of a copy	 then track it down and watch it. It's not Shakespeare. In fact	 it's less articulate than Coolio in `China Strike Force'	 but you will be impressed with both the moves on display and the pain felt by the stunt team - (I'm pretty sure there's no safe way to land directly on your head	 or be forced to head butt a wooden roof by a speeding car!?).<br /><br />"	1.0
"After a quasi-Gothic	 all-fruity music video	 the movie starts with Cassidy the lead singer killing herself. In a perfect world that would be that and the end credits would roll.

The only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay. And no amount of Hollywood cartoon snakes can change that.<br /><br />This movie isn't worth a trip to Blockbuster. Be warned: if you pay for it	 the only ""victim"" is your dumb ass.<br /><br />If you want to be really scared	 I suggest the Descent. If you want humor	 go to your local stand up comedy club. Their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash."	0.0
"Hey everyone...<br /><br />There really isn't much to say for this movie at all. The basic plot is that a guy (Brandon) takes a few friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend holiday away from work. After picking up a girl on the way there	 things start going badly wrong for all of them.<br /><br />The storyline alone (written by the actor playing Brandon	 I believe	 although I could be wrong here) is unlikely and unconvincing	 and is acted out accordingly. The ""Clown Killer"" himself is a rather a sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being a dark	 mysterious but most of all	 intelligent predator	 we are instead offered a rather clumsy	 nursery rhyme-singing buffoon who appears to be going through a minor mid life crisis. The only thing that warranted the writing of this comment were the sex scenes and whatever gore there was in the film (the quality of the film led me to derive some enjoyment out of such things).<br /><br />In short	 this film falls below every possible set standard. Admittedly	 I was sharing a few beers with a close friend as I watched this	 so we managed to scrape together some relative entertainment value out of this film and it is therefore only fair to mention that S.I.C.K did fall just shy of a two rating. However	 in reality	 (and with the benefit of hindsight) the one star rating is a more than legitimate score for this film.<br /><br />1 star out of ten."	0.0
"are highlights of this 1917 feature. The Pride of the Clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies. On an island off the coast of Scotland	 the villagers live the simple lives of ""fisher folk."" My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read	 but the film boasts some stunning ocean scenery	 and the camera work on boats is splendid. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this pleasant film. Pickford was already a major star in 1917	 and this film seems to have been written just for her: plucky young woman succeeds over misfortune. Pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is very funny. And the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done. Not a great Picford film	 but still worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother	 Owen Moore) is the love interest	 and is good as the strapping island lad. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers but I couldn't spot her either. My copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the village warning bells are rung. Very effective."	1.0
"Though not a fan of Sam Rockwell	 I was surprised when I saw his name in the credits in the opening of 'Joshua.' Heck	 I wasn't even aware he was in 'Joshua' until I started the movie. So it goes without saying	 I was watching the movie on the basis of the movie	 not the leads. A sort of 'Rosemary's Baby	' 'The Omen' or any other demonic kid movie 'Joshua' was billed. Unfortunately	 it fell flat. Slow	 incredibly slow	 and flat. Yet	 I continued on to see how this would all resolve	 hoping beyond belief	 the ending climax would shed some light on the subject. Okay	 I admit	 it did (a wee bit) but what a stale closing. And what a low-low budget movie	 or at least that's how they designed it. A person falls  you don't see the drop	 you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood. A person gets hit by a cab  you don't see it	 you see someone complaining	 holding a bike up. I'm not sure if this is called ""style"" or laziness or simply	 lack of funds for special effects. We have a ""rich"" family with a crazy mom	 a workaholic father attempting to balance everything	 a kid  Joshua	 who may/may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot. She cries as much as we see how many days she's alive  and what was that about? Are there rats above or is it Joshua? Is his mother nuts? Is Joshua crazy? Is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family? Is he going to grow up to be Michael Myers? Or does he drive his family to the brink? I don't think so. They were nuts prior	 and no ""so-called"" acting could make me believe otherwise. Unfortunately	 barely any questions were answered	 barely any open doors shut. I'm sure that might have been the idea	 but for Pete's sake	 give me something. Anything. There are plenty better kid-gone-wild movies to explore. Joshua's more like the Mini-Me of the antichrist."	0.0
"This may have been made for the hell of it	 but it was most probably the worst film i've seen in years	 The best thing about the entire DVD would be the case!!! I'm surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too	 I'm glad i only rented. I suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and Gothic to care about it without taking in any CGI or any other effects for that matter	 I hope Alex Chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and SFX to make a better film in the future	 that is	 if he is still in work.<br /><br />Notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing	 DON'T BUY IT!!!!!"	0.0
"Once again proving his amazing versatility	 John Turturro plays the introspective Russian chess genius preparing for a comeback tournament	 and forging an unlikely relationship with a gadabout fellow resident (Emily Watson) at a 1920's Italian hotel. They fall in love	to the horror of her social-mountaineering mother (Geraldine James).A wonderful love story	 whose gloss of chess might make it appear cerebral.But in spite of its origins in a Nabakov story	 it certainly is not .The romantic elements and the sense of time and place beat the psychological analysis hands down.John Turturro	 having appeared in ""Barton Fink"" 	""O Brother	Where Art thou?"" ""The Big Lebowski"" proves that he is not dependant on Coen Bros films to assert his stature."	1.0

"After an initial release of 4 very good Eurotrash titles	 REDEMPTION has managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. I found NO Bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie.<br /><br />The story is simple. A mysterious count invites several actresses to his castle for a little vacation. After some sofcore sexual shenanigans the girls get decapitated one by one. Who is the killer? Who knows? There are more red herrings in this one than at the local fish market on Friday.<br /><br />The pace is excruciating. The story is silly and the skin scenes aren't all that terrific either.<br /><br />Give this one a miss."	0.0
"I really love this movie	 saw it again last week after 3 years or so. This movie is perfect	 great acting	 great story	 great directing/camera-work/music. It is a gift to show it to someone you love. too bad jaco van dormael did not make more movies after this one. Top 5 work. Really!!<br /><br />Today	 it's 3 years and 3 days later then the comment above. it was never posted because it was not more than 10 lines. Anyway	 i saw ""le huitieme jour"" again yesterday. This is with no doubt in my movie top 3. together with ""Cinema Paradiso"" which is also a masterpiece. The soundtrack is also really good. I am really curious about ""jaco von dormael's"" new movie. I hope it will complete my movie top 3. If you see this movie	 rent it. Or even better. buy it. Because you will want to see it again."	1.0
"Being a music student myself	 I thought a movie taking place in a conservatory might be fun to watch. Little did I know... (I had no idea this movie was based on a book by Britney Spears) This movie was implausible throughout. It's obvious that whoever wrote the script never set foot in a conservatory and doesn't know a thing about classical music. Let me give you just a few examples: 1) There is NO WAY anyone would be admitted to a classical conservatory with no classical training whatsoever! Just having a nice pop voice isn't enough	 besides	 that's a different thing altogether - another genre	 different technique. It's like playing the violin when applying for a viola class. 2) How come the lady teaching music theory was in the singing jury? If she wasn't a singing professor herself	 she would have no say in a situation like that	 and if she was a singing professor	 why weren't we told so? 3) Being able to read music is a necessity if you're to major in music. 4) How did Angela get a hold of that video tape? That would have been kept confidential	 for the jury's eyes only. Now either she got the tape from one of the professors or the script writers just didn't have a clue. I wonder which... 5) The singing professor gave Holly the Carmen song saying she ""had the range""	 which she clearly did NOT. Yes	 she was able to sing the notes	 but Carmen is a mezzo-soprano	 while Holly's voice seemed to be much lighter in timbre	 not at all compatible with that song. 6) Worst of all: Not only does the movie show a shocking ignorance when it comes to classical music	 but it doesn't even try to hide it. The aria that Angela sings is mutilated beyond recognition	 a fact which is painfully blatant at the recital	 where it is cut short in a disgraceful way - Mozart would roll over in his grave. The Habanera from Carmen sounded a bit weird at times	 too	 and the way it was rearranged at the end just shows how little the producers really think of classical music - it's stiff and boring but hey	 add some drums and electric guitars and it's almost as good as Britney Spears! I know these are all minor details	 but it would have been so easy to avoid them with just a little research. Anyhow	 I might have chosen to suspend my disbelief had the characters and the plot been well elaborated. But without that	 I really can't find any redeeming qualities in this movie except for one: it's good for a laugh."	0.0

"This third Darkman was definitely better than the second one	 but still far worse than the original movie. What made this one better than D2 was the fact that The Bad Guy had been changed and Durant was not brought back again.

This made my heart soften and I gave this flick as much as 4/10	 i.e. **/*****."	0.0
"This is on my top list of all-time favourite films! It is a fantastic and insightful film. It was Historically interesting and great to watch! I thought the acting from Emily Blunt was fantastic and Rupert Friend was a fantastic Albert	 the best actor was chosen for Albert. The costumes were gorgeous and the settings and scenes such as the opera house	 were amazing and detailed. I just loved it	 all of it! I loved the childhood scenes were she's getting 'bullied' by John Conroy. And where her mother says she has to walk stairs with an adult. One again the writers have done it! They produced this fantastic script! <br /><br />It thoroughly deserves the awards they got. (Oscar and BAFTA wining Sandy Powell	 for costume design. A BAFTA for best make-up and hair	 an Oscar in Best Achievement in Art Direction	 Best Achievement in Costume Design	 Best Achievement in Makeup. Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards for Best costume design	 also nominated for best actress Emily Blunt. CDG for Excellence in Costume Design for Film - Period. Hampton's International Film Awards for an Audience Award for Best Narrative Film. PFCS for Best Costume design.Sudbury Cinefest	 doesn't say what for. VFCC for Best Actress	 Emily Blunt.) Overall 10 wins and 11 nominations! That pretty good! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/awards Have a look yourself	 its really interesting! Personally Rupert Friend should have got an award."	1.0
"Picture the fugly annoying goth kids from college in a scat film	 throw in a pinch of story and a whole lot of awful acting	 and you are still not even close to how bad this movie is.<br /><br />Shot badly	 bad effects	 worse acting. Contrived attempt at shocking horror. Everyone I've showed this to gets kinda depressed watching it. The sex scenes are disturbing	 not necessarily for their content	 but more because they're just something you want to end as soon as possible. The last sex scene is just foul	 even before she gets to the guy.<br /><br />I'm one of those people that loves to watch movies that people hate	 which is why I picked this one up. But for your own sake	 save yourself the time and avoid this abhorrence. It's that bad. I literally threw it in the garbage."	0.0
"I really	 really didn't expect this type of a film outside of America. How anyone can take the subject of sexually abusing children and turn it into a ""thriller"" is just sick. Auteuil (whom I had previously admired) going around like some sort of child-saving Rambo was ignorant and insulting to all the children being sexually exploited around the world.<br /><br />What's doubly depressing is that the stunning and ground-breaking film ""Happiness"" came out the year BEFORE this film. Menges and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves. It's admirable to read some of the comments by the more intelligent viewers out there. They were able to see the shoddy and ridiculous handling of this topic. Those of you who think this is great cinema display a disgusting amount of ignorance and you need to watch ""Happiness"" to open your minds to the true horrors of pedophilia.<br /><br />Do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or be molested by a neighbor	 teacher	 friend or even a relative? Hmm...I wonder. If they are going to make a film about international child slavery of whatever kind they owe it to everyone to make it realistic and emotionally involving instead of this button-pushing crap. 1/10"	0.0
"I simply give this a three because it fulfilled what my buddies and I hoped it would do: entertain. <br /><br />I wasn't stupid enough to rent this thinking it would be a zombie film up there with the likes of Romero or Fulci	 but what I rented it for was a laugh. <br /><br />If you are looking for a film for amusement	 or a film to make you shake your head in embarrassment	 go for it. This is perfect for junior- ""Mystery Science Theater"" fans	 but the only downside is that it is so bad	 it makes fun of itself. <br /><br />I	 personally	 think it is a shame to relate this to any other Hollywood title that we may know	 because when a film sucks like this	 it has its own genre."	0.0
"I like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema	 made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies. It is filled with Super-surfer Greg Noll's home movies	 and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50-year passion. Nevertheless	 it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory. It is filled with artistic talent	 and athletic talent	 however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic. Surfers are not astronauts nor test-pilots. Nor are they surgeons(perhaps) or Ph.d's(again	 perhaps). It believes in the quest of the surfer. It believes in the beauty of human goofiness. It believes in the great gift of peace	 which comes from the cessation of war. Surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese zeroes fifteen years before. It celebrates the down-time of a country which fought a cold war-instead of a hot-war - with the Russian socialists. Surfing is the ultimate narcissism. It is dangerous	 but only slightly historical. I suspect Alexander the Great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique. He had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received. This movie has no military heroes. It has no guns. The only beach-head surfers conquer has a beer-stand and and a surfboard shop. This is not a problem. Peace is not desperate. It is the joy of exhalation."	1.0

"I'm 47 years old and I've spent as much of my life as I can remember	 a fan of horror and sci-fi films. Be they silent	 black and white	 no budget or big budget	 there are very few of them that I can't find something to like about. That said	 I'll give this movie credit for good gore and creature effects but that's all. This is a case of effects over story. Truth is we live in a time where there is very little left that hasn't been seen in a horror film. Therefor for a film of any kind to really entertain it must have a good	 original story.

"This is the biggest piece of lamo I've ever watched. It is excruciatingly boring I would have rather sat through a seminar on creationism than have watched this if i had known it was going to be as boring as it was. Not even the 40 seconds of the hot chick in the bikini with the big ta tas redeems this of anything lower than a 1.<br /><br />The reviews of this movie claiming that this movie is ""unintentionally funny"" are absurd and just plain WRONG. Not one thing is funny about this movie. they spend the first 50 or so minutes walking through the woods talking about stuff you wouldn't understand nor care about and it is just as lame when the people start dying because you don't even know who the people are because they are so UNINTERESTING. Honestly though	 I didn't watch it to the ending	 but that should say something about how horrible it is. WORST MOVIE EVER.<br /><br />Immediately after ejecting this filth from my DVD player I started scraping it against the cement in front of my house	 not wanting other blockbuster customers to have to fall upon the same mistake i had made as to rent this movie.

"It doesn't take long to see why Code Name: Diamond Head didn't make it onto the network schedules. The TV pilot movie doesn't get past the credits before it's obvious just how bad it's going to be. Maybe I missed something	 because the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense. Based on what I got out of the muddled mess	 a terrorist or thief or something named ""Tree"" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon. The world's dullest secret agent	 Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes)	 is out to stop him. There might have been more	 but trust me  it really doesn't matter anyway.<br /><br />Action movies should have action. Suspenseful moments should have suspense. And dramatic moments should have drama. There's none of that in Code Name: Diamond Head. I've seen others use the word ""turgid"" to describe this made for TV snoozer  and it's better than any one word description I can come up with. None of the characters is in the least bit exciting or worth caring about. And Roy Thinnes makes for the worst leads imaginable. His charisma is just slightly north of a slug. Ian McShane is easily the best thing the movie has going for it	 but unfortunately for everyone else involved	 it doesn't appear he was going to be back as a regular cast member. Now if McShane had been cast in the series lead	 well then you might have had something.<br /><br />I'm quickly discovering that these Gawd awful 70s made-for-TV movies make great Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes. And that goes double if Quinn Martin was involved. Very funny stuff from Mike and the Bots. So while I may only give the movie a 3/10	 I rate Episode #608 a 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale."	0.0

"Noting the cast	 I recently watched this movie on TCM	 hoping for an under-appreciated gem	 as I regard many films from the 30's. This is no gem - not even semi-precious. The anachronistic clothing and 1930's Rolls Royce limo hit you immediately. The casting is strange	 also. But mostly	 there are too many dumb and unnecessary plot devices. This film has lots of good ingredients and a basic plot that holds promise	 but the components aren't mixed according to the right recipe. It simply doesn't come together like it should. And that's a shame. WIth a few rather obvious	 but minor alterations	 this might have been a very good movie.<br /><br />The film is about an American showgirl (Jean Harlow) seeking a rich British husband - preferably from the nobility. She meets Franchot Tone and his buddy	 who are on a lark in a Rolls Royce owned by his buddy's employer. Harlow mistakenly assumes Tone is the Lord who owns the Rolls	 and she sets her sights on him. This early part of the film is a light comedy of no real distinction. <br /><br />However	 Tone unwittingly uncovers the fact that his employer is actually a German 5th columnist on the eve of WWI	 and that is when the movie changes tone altogether and begins to fall apart. Tone and Harlow are married	 but just as the honeymoon begins	 he is gunned down by a Mata Hari-type (Benita Hume)	 and Harlow flees the scene	 with a bystander accusing her of Tone's murder. (In fact	 Tone recovers from the wounds.)<br /><br />Harlow flees to France	 where she falls in love again - this time with a wealthy French cad (Cary Grant). Tone	 now in the army	 and Harlow are unexpectedly brought back together in Grant's hospital room where he is in rehab from a plane crash. In the following scene	 Tone accuses Harlow of abandoning him because she is essentially a gold-digger. Harlow never explains about the witness' accusing her of murder and her panic! That is one of those unreal	 movie-plot-device break-downs in the story.<br /><br />Then Tone is also brought back into contact with the woman (Hume) who shot him. She is on hand to watch her paramour	 Grant	 test the new plane that Tone has delivered to him from England. Incredibly	 both Hume and Tone dimly recognize each other	 but simply can't place where from! Okay	 so Tone was shot and almost died; perhaps his memory is a little out of whack. But how many men did Hume shoot that she would forget one of her marks? (She does not seem to be faking the memory lapse.)<br /><br />This is inexplicable and unnecessary. Hume should have absolutely recognized him	 but played it coy when she realized that Tone wasn't able to place her. That would have been a much better treatment of that issue.<br /><br />The finale also is very unsatisfying. The movie	 as made	 has Tone and Harlow conspiring to preserve the good reputation of the cad	 Grant	 leading to his fraudulent burial as a hero. Then Harlow and Tone just walk away. It is noble to preserve the French public's perception of their national war hero	 but very unsatisfying as a love story!<br /><br />What the film begs for is this: Harlow explains that she fled in a panic in the face of accusations of murder; Tone forgives her and quietly rekindles his love for her; he then carries a torch for her	 even while helping her to rig the crash site to preserve Grant's reputation. Meanwhile	 Harlow finally recognizes Grant for the cad he is. Then having seen Tone for the brave and noble man he is	 Harlow rekindles feelings for him	 too. At film's end	 the two of them become reconciled even as they work together to rig the appearance of Grant's death. After Grant's hero's burial	 we see them embrace and kiss at the fade-out. That would have made a nice little movie. For Cary Grant fans	 it would have been even better had Tone played the French cad who is killed and Grant the long-suffering first husband	 reunited with Harlow.<br /><br />It is incomprehensible that Franchot Tone is cast as the Irishman living in England	 while Cary Grant is cast as the Frenchman. This movie would have been much better had they reversed roles. That also would have been more conducive to the film that should have been..."	0.0
The setting and actors make this television movie for me the best rendition of Dickens' classic tale. George C. Scott is very believable as is the rest of the cast. His Scrooge oozes with nastiness until the very end of the movie. Then his character changes to one who is truly repentant. The 19th Century English town chosen for the setting creates an ambiance that is fitting to Dickens and adds to the plausibility of this film. It is a movie I watch every Christmas along with the real Grinch and It's A Wonderful Life.	1.0
"18 directors had the same task: tell stories of love set in Paris. Naturally	 some of them turned out better than others	 but the whole mosaic is pretty charming - besides	 wouldn't it be boring if all of them had the same vision of love? Here's how I rank the segments (that might change on a second viewing):<br /><br />1. ""Quartier Latin""	 by Gérard Depardieu<br /><br />One of the greatest French actors ever directed my favourite segment	 featuring the always stunning Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara. Witty and delightful.<br /><br />2. ""Tour Eiffel""	 by Sylvain Chomet<br /><br />Cute	 visually stunning (thanks to the director of ""The Triplets of Belleville"") story of a little boy whose parents are mimes;<br /><br />3. ""Tuileries""	 by Ethan and Joel Coen<br /><br />The Coen Brothers + Steve Buscemi = Hilarious<br /><br />4. ""Parc Monceau""	 by Alfonso Cuarón (""Y Tu Mamá También""	 ""Children of Men"")	 feat. Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (funny);<br /><br />5. ""Place des Fêtes""	 by Oliver Schmitz	 feat. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga (touching);<br /><br />6. ""14th Arrondissement""	 Alexander Payne's (""Election""	 ""About Schmidt"") wonderful look for the pathetic side of life is present here	 feat. the underrated character actress Margo Martindale (Hilary Swank's mother in ""Million Dollar Baby"") as a lonely	 middle-aged American woman on vacation;<br /><br />7. ""Faubourg Saint-Denis""	 Tom Tykwer's (""Run Lola Run"") frantic style works in the story of a young actress (Natalie Portman) and a blind guy (Melchior Beslon) who fall in love;<br /><br />8. ""Père-Lachaise""	 by Wes Craven	 feat. Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (plus a curious cameo by Alexander Payne as...Oscar Wilde!);<br /><br />9. ""Loin du 16ème""	 by Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas (simple but moving story from the talented Brazilian directors	 feat. Catalina Sandino Moreno);<br /><br />10. ""Quartier des Enfants Rouges""	 by Olivier Assayas (""Clean"")	 a sad story feat. the always fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal;<br /><br />11. ""Le Marais""	 by Gus Van Sant	 feat. Gaspard Ulliel	 Elias McConnell and Marianne Faithful (simple	 but funny);<br /><br />12. ""Quartier de la Madeleine""	 by Vincenzo Natali	 feat. Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko;<br /><br />13. ""Quais de Seine""	 by Gurinder Chadha;<br /><br />14. ""Place des Victoires""	 by Nobuhiro Suwa	 feat. Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe;<br /><br />15. ""Bastille""	 by Isabel Coixet (fabulous director of the underrated ""My Life Without Me"")	 feat. Miranda Richardson	 Sergio Castellitto	 Javier Cámara and Leonor Watling;<br /><br />16. ""Pigalle""	 by Richard LaGravenese	 feat. Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant;<br /><br />17. ""Montmartre""	 by and with Bruno Podalydès;<br /><br />18. ""Porte de Choisy""	 by Christopher Doyle	 with Barbet Schroeder (mostly known as the director of ""Barfly""	 ""Reversal of Fortune"" and ""Single White Female"").<br /><br />I could classify some segments as brilliant and others as average (or even slightly boring)	 but not a single of them is plain bad. On the whole	 I give ""Paris	 Je t'Aime"" an 8.5/10 and recommend it for what it is: a lovely mosaic about love and other things in between."	1.0
"I remember when I was five and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon movie....except when the bras and bullets started flying. I have to agree this movie will make anyone and everyone upset because it is set to discriminate everyone and anyone....but the truth is it is funny as hell as it is deep. I recommend this to anyone who likes cult classics. Also try Fritz the cat and the NINE Lives of Fritz the Cat. If I'm correct Ralph Bashki did that movie too.It involves a cat that goes through hard times with family	 streets	jobs 	 etc. When I was old enough I rented all of these movies out. Because Coonskin was an offensive title during that era it was also labeled as Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki also made Cool World starring a very young Brad Pitt. Heavy traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man."	1.0
"Final Score: 1.8 (out of 10)<br /><br />After seeing 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' I must have been on a big Eliza Dushku kick when I rented this movie. 'Soul Survivors' is a junk ""psychological thriller"" dressed up like a trashy teen slasher flick - even to the point of having a masked killer stalk a cast of young up-and-comers like Dushku	 Wes Bentley (American Beauty)	 Casey Affleck (Drowning Mona) and likable star Melissa Sagemiller. Luke Wilson is also in there	 ridiculously miscast as a priest. The movie	 the brainchild of writer/director Stephen Carpenter	 seems like a mutant offspring of 'Open Your Eyes' or 'Vanilla Sky' and movies where a character (and the audience) is caught in a world of dillusion caused by an accident/death. The movie keeps churning out perplexing images and leaves us in a state of confusion the entire running time until this alternate reality is finally resolved. I don't think these movies are that entertaining- by their very nature- to begin with	 but 'SS' is rock-bottom cheap trash cinema any way you slice it. The visuals	 the script	 the acting and the attempt at any originality all are throwaway afterthoughts to movies like this. Plus	 it's PG-13 so it doesn't even deliver the gore or T&A to sustain it as a guilty pleasure (even the unrated version is tame). I had heard that the movie contained some ""hot"" shower scene between Dushku & Sagemiller. As the movie fell apart in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost I found myself waiting patiently for the shower scene - at least I would get something out of this. Then it comes: the two girls get paint on their shirts	 they jump in the shower fully clothed and scrub it off. That's it. People thought this was hot? 'Soul Survivors' is one of those drop-dead boring movies that is so weak and inept that it is hard to have ANY feelings at all toward it. It puts out nothing and is hardly worth writing about. In the end it leaves us empty. Carpenter's finale is a mess of flashing light and pounding sound and that's probably the most lively part. It will no doubt be making the rounds as a late night staple on USA or the Sci-Fi Channel	 due to it's low cost and PG-13 rating - and that's probably best for it."	0.0
"A riotous farce set in the world of glamorous daytime soap operas! This film is hilarious! Admittedly	 you have to have a taste for films with screaming	 hysterical dialogue	 over-the-top acting	 and melodramatic plot twists. But if you do	 you're in for one hell of a treat.<br /><br />Sally Field plays Celeste Talbert	 daytime TV's ""Queen of Misery."" Celeste's cushy life is thrown into upheaval with the unexpected arrival of Lori Craven (Elisabeth Shue)	 her long-lost niece	 and	 simultaneously	 Jeffrey Anderson (Kevin Kline - splendid as always)	 Celeste's long-ago lover. But Celeste has been hiding a deep	 dark secret	 and the arrival of Lori and Jeffrey might just bring it to the surface. Add in the diabolical Montana Moorehead (a wonderful Cathy Moriarty	 in full ""gorgeous woman with testosterone to spare mode"")	 who is trying mighty hard to destroy Celeste's career; David (Robert Downey	 Jr.)	 the weenie-boy producer of the soap who's secretly plotting with Montana to ruin Celeste; and	 Rose Schwarz (Whoopi Goldberg)	 scriptwriter and Celeste's one true confidant	 and you are in for a heaping helping of subplots and general chaos.<br /><br />Chaotic comedies like this are tricky to execute (does anyone remember 'Mixed Nuts'?)	 but when done well	 can be pretty damn funny! A major ingredient that is necessary to any good comedy is the casting of seasoned pros who know that lots of times the funniest things are not said but seen in an expression or a look. Field	 Kline	 Goldberg	 and the rest all work together so well and are clearly having a great time that it is hard not to become drawn in by their energy and enthusiasm. Shue is clearly the weakest link here	 but she only draws attention to herself because she is surrounded by Field	 Kline	 et al. Moriarty is a stand-out in the showy villainess role	 making you think of the hottest damn dominatrix you ever did see!! There are also lots of familiar faces that you'll recognize in small (but	 nevertheless	 all very funny) roles	 including Carrie Fisher	 Garry Marshall	 Kathy Najimy	 and Teri Hatcher. Director Michael Hoffman keeps the pace swift and the histrionic plot moving toward the big finish. Mention must also be made of Robert Harling's screenplay	 carefully constructed to stage a soap opera within a soap opera. The dialogue is boiling over with great lines	 delivered brilliantly by the actors (I'd be willing to bet that a lot of this stuff was improvised).<br /><br />Look	 if you want to see a bunch of pros doing what they do best and having a great time doing it	 get your hands on this one. If not for anything else	 it will put you in a good mood and make you laugh!"	1.0
"Generally I don't do minus's and if this site could i would give this movie -3 out of 10 meaning I really hated this movie. I thought Uwe Boll's alone in the dark was the worst i've seen yet but at least i gave it a 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion(Stephen Dorff shooting at nothing made me laugh so i boosted the ratings a bit). Hell if it was if compared to bloodrayne	 Bloodrayne would win a Oscar for best movie if they were competing.<br /><br />Now to the plot	 this movie is about the BTK killer which is fine but they've could have done better. The start looked OK but that's it I had to fast forward most of it because the death's where boring. I like killer movies and even if they suck they could still get some cool deaths. I'm not a fancy movie expert but believe me he would have shot himself if did see this. Sorry for rambling but there's nothing good to say about it	 because it looks like someone took a camcorder and film this.. this.. thing of disaster. Uwe Boll your movies are no longer on my list of worst movies ever this took the cake.<br /><br />Well sorry i couldn't explain the plot(if there was one) but that was the best i could. Now if you don't mind i'm going to crawl into a corner and move back and forth and reminding me of how bad this movie scared me for life.... OK not for life"	0.0
"If you have read the books then forget the characters that Tolkien built in your head. The representation of hobbits	 dwarves etc have had the 'disney' treatment. The dark riders are excellent	 and as I had always imagined from the books.<br /><br />Cinematically this is an excellent film	 mixing live motion and animation to produce amazing effects for the year. I only wish he (Bakshi) had been given the money to complete his epic.<br /><br />It's worth having the video as they will be worth a bit after the 2001 Lord of the Rings !!"	1.0
"First let me say I am not from the south but I am an American. I don't love Country music but I can stomach it. I would never wear a cowboy hat but I wear hats. I don't live in a trailer but I do eat tuna salad and own a home. What does that have to do with this comment? A lot if you are one of those people who say only ""country"" people love this movie. This movie is loosely based on the ""They loved and lost"" premise. James Bridges directs an American love story as real as it gets. In an era of Jerry Springer and ""Lets put it out there"" mentality	 this film rings truer than ever. <br /><br />Bud is ""coming of age"" and embarks on a life of his own with a little help from his aunt and uncle so he moves to the big city with them. Bud finds himself drawn into the local honky tonk world for the only escape a blue collar man can afford. He quickly meets Sissy who is from a similar background and the two have a whirlwind romance filled with painful ups and downs. <br /><br />(*This plot takes so many turns that one has to just sit for a few minutes before they get hooked. Marriage is a focus here that is often missed. Early in the film they marry and we view the transition from being single to married. The film highlights some of the modern struggles a woman has when she marries an old fashioned man. It also brings into view the male ego with women and competition.)<br /><br />Bud is challenged and is excited when Micky's puts in an electronic bull. Sissy gets ideas of having fun on it too but is quickly reminded that she is married and need to start ""acting like it."" The emotion between the two characters is raw and expressive and the plot continues from there especially when they (NOTE THIS IS GIVING SOME OF THE STORYLINE AWAY) split and Sissy falls for an ex con with a penchant for abuse and cruelty. She soon realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other side.<br /><br />How anyone can compare Bud to Vinnie Barbirino is shocking to me. John Travolta gave an exceptional performance that was worthy recognition. He was believable and real. The scene where he shaves his beard and you first see him at the bar..still gives me goosebumps. Mind you I am not a huge Travolta fan	 but come on	 I see why Sissy was kicking of her boots so early in the film. Deb Winger was so real that you found yourself sympathizing with her as she pens a note of emotions to Bud	 after sneaking in to clean his house during their break up. <br /><br />The supporting cast was incredible. Wes played by Scott Glenn gave a first rate performance that made you hate him and curse him as he abused Sissy. Madolyn Smith-Osborne	 as Buds Mistress/girlfriend was so authentic that large chested girls across the U.S. prayed to wake up flat chested to wear the clothes she donned in the film. My biggest kudos's go to Barry Corbin and Brooke Anderson as Bud's aunt and uncle. They seemed like someone's aunt and uncle somewhere in Texas and however small their role	 they made the film so much bigger and lifelike. Two memorable scenes were the Dolly Parton contest and the unforgettable scene where Bud and his aunt stand outside after one of the characters death. The dialog between them is touching.<br /><br />If you can watch this for what it is	 a true American love story. Then I recommend that you take it for what it is...a film before it's time that gave us voyeurism into a world unlike our own but real enough for our enjoyment and entertainment. If this world sounds similar to yours then you will enjoy it so much more. Lastly	 the music however dated	 is sure to send you back in time if you are over 30 years of age."	1.0
"Of all the movies of the seventies	 none captured to truest essence of the good versus evil battle as did the Sentinel. I mean	 yes	 there were movies like the Exorcist	 and other ones; but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one. If you have time	 check this one out. You may not be able to get past the dated devices as such	 but this is a story worth getting into.Then there are all the stars and soon-to-be stars. My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach	 Sylvia Miles	 and Burgess Meredith. Then there are the subtle clues that lead to what's going on too. Pay close attention. I had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like 'black and white cat	 black and white cake'. Plus	 the books are really good as well. I'm just sorry that they're not going to turn the second book into a film. It's so scary that it would outdo this movie."	1.0
"... when this movie so well proves that they indeed are unnecessary.<br /><br />Although few lines	 it was kind of weird to see this movie	 no subs	 in a language unknown. A friend of mine sent a VHS	 included a few pieces of papers with all lines translated to English. with her translation next to me	 I began watching this tale (it is indeed a tale)	 and from the very first tunes of the whistling melody during opening credits I was stuck. the colours	 that minimal acting (well	 in most cases)	 absurd comedy	 slapstick	 thoughtful	 beautiful... along with a few other movies (Paris	 Texas and Nenette et Boni)	 this one is able to speak to anyone's heart - without words. Whenever you get the chance	 see it. Whatever you do - don't miss it. It's a once in a lifetime experience. Oh	 acting is great	 the soundtrack is brilliant	 the story is simple and told a thousand times before - but rarely (never?) like this."	1.0
"Redundant	 everlasting shots	 useless shots	 useless scenes are what you will find in this film. In other words	 it seemed technically poor to me. The musical bits are amateurishly directed (no synchronization in the would-be dancing	 badly post-synchronized	 bad and obvious improvisation of the actors from time to time	 etc). <br /><br />The film is long and boring. Eventually	 it makes few point and even less sense. <br /><br />There are some good ideas though. Some of the comic elements are actually efficient	 especially the opening scene. However	 the film gets worse and worse so that it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand by the end. <br /><br />The trailer I saw was very dynamic	 that is not true for the film. That is to say the discrepancy between the trailer and the actual film is something very close to a rip off."	0.0
"Russell Hopton acted in many films until his death in 1945. He only directed 2 and ""Black Gold"" was one	 (the other was also from 1936). Frankie Darro had a sometimes abrasive screen presence but in this he was playing a good kid. He was obviously quite popular on the ""quickie"" circuit - he made so many films. In this one he plays the son of an old oil rigger who is convinced that he will strike oil very soon.<br /><br />J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) is trying to convince the old man to sell up as he knows there is going to be oil struck at any moment. A geologist	 Henry	 comes on the scene and helps ""Fishtail's"" dad. He also convinces ""Fishtail"" to go to school regularly. Henry has his eye on Cynthia	 the pretty teacher. This was Gloria Shea's last film - she had begun her career as Olive Shea in ""Glorifying the American Girl"" (1929). ""Fishtail's"" dad is killed when the rig is sabotaged and Henry is determined to bring Anderson and his cronies to justice. When Henry is kidnapped Anderson tries to persuade ""Fishtail"" to sell his oil lease. It all ends well with oil being struck and ""Fishtail"" going to Military school.<br /><br />It is okay for a rainy day."	0.0
"I do admit that my review is from a 2006 point of view	 nearly 30 years after the making of this movie and at the time of its conception	 it may have been a brilliant horror/thriller movie.<br /><br />Beginning on Halloween night 1968	 6 year old Michael commits the brutal murder of his 18 year old sister. Michael is committed to a mental institution and 15 years later escapes and returns to his home town to murder again.<br /><br />From this point it is clear that the movie will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is highly predictable. The beginning of every scene is easily predictable in the way it will end whilst the music for each scene containing Michael (the murderer) is exactly the same throughout the movie	 thus alerting the viewer to the likely events to follow.<br /><br />For the horror/thriller enthusiast	 there is a severe lack of blood/gore compared to modern day films although I am not akin to the amount that is displayed in this day and age. A happier medium could have been found.<br /><br />From a half hour into the movie	 not one scene is unexpected. The acting for a horror/thriller film is fairly typical of the era and thus lacks any punch for the modern day enthusiast.<br /><br />A positive for the film is its lingering camera shots and dark lighting which creates a frightening atmosphere. A second positive would be the character of Michael's doctor	 who provides clues to the probability of where the story may lead.<br /><br />However	 it is clear that the star	 in Jamie-Lee Curtis	 is in the infancy stages of her acting career and thus fails to provide a truly frightened central victim.<br /><br />It is hard for me to rate this film as it was in its day	 but from other horror/thriller films of indeed the 80s and to a lesser extent	 the 90s	 it falls far short of a truly great horror/thriller film.<br /><br />I suggest you move on and find a classic from the 80s. Cheers!"	0.0
"I enjoy quality crapness	 and this ranks up there with some of the finest. the cg is out of this world	 or at least pre-dates our world	 and the insanity of a 6 foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad. I quite enjoyed some of this	 but the acting is so goddamn awful	 and even the obligatory nude scene doesn't really have any baps out in it. just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one. I don't know who wasted more time	 me watching this	 or the poor saps who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers. I can assure you	 it wont. However	 on a brighter note	 I have managed to successfully do the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon from this movie	 so I think it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minutes of it."	0.0
"Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. What else can I say. Kate Jackson must have been desperate to direct. May be she should go back to acting...on second thought she was a bad actress to. Who would put money in to producing something this bad. I like anti-Christ movies and usually have a good laugh and the odd scare but this one is just Bad Bad Bad. The acting by the stars was worse than what you find on a soap opera. The special effects	 if you can call them that	 where laughable. I would not be surprised if you played the scenes in slow motion you would see the tubes the blood shoots out of. We had to turn the disc off after only 30 minutes. This so called movies original prints should be destroyed	 all disc' and tapes destroyed and all the people associated with the making of the movie have to pay back money to the people that rented the movie. Then those people should never be allowed to act	 direct or film any thing but their own home movies."	0.0
"Well well well. As good as John Carpenter's season 1 outing in ""Masters of Horror"" was	 this is the complete opposite. He certainly proved he was still a master of horror with ""Cigarette Burns"" but ""Pro-Life"" is perhaps the worst I have seen from him.<br /><br />It's stupid	 totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and it overstays it's welcome	 despite the less-than-an-hour running time. The script is nonsense	 the characters are irritable and un-appealing and the conclusion is beyond absurd.<br /><br />And for those suckers who actually bought the DVD (one of them being me); did you see how Carpenter describes the film? He's actually proud of it and he talks about it as his best work for a long time	 and he praises the script. And in the commentary track	 where he notices an obvious screw up that made it to the final cut	 he just says he didn't feel it essential to rectify the mistake and he just let it be there. I fear the old master has completely lost his touch. I sincerely hope I'm proved wrong.<br /><br />I want to leave on a positive note and mention that the creature effects are awesome	 though. Technically speaking	 this film is top notch	 with effective lighting schemes and make up effects."	0.0

"I can't quite say that ""Jerry Springer:Ringmaster"" is the worst film I have ever seen. The film would be better off if it were	 because at least the worst film I've ever seen	 (Prom Night II) interested me enough for me to hate it. My only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when I looked up at the clock and discovered that only 90 minutes had passed. It had seemed much more like years. It is an endless repetition of poor people	 (or what Jerry Springer seems to believe poor people are)	 screwing each other	 hitting each other	 insulting each other	 and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing. The plot	 which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the Jerry Springer mill	 advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters. This makes it impossible to care what happens to them. It never mattered to me whether they got on the show	 or what they said	 or who slept with whom. Maybe I'm not supposed to care about them. Maybe I'm supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type-- to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny. Too bad it isn't. The humor is not outrageous. It's innocuous. It's predictable. Humor has to have something behind it	 some kind of painful irony or life experience	 in order to function. Scatology is not wit. An example. A mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed. To take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughter's boyfriend. Since I was over the shock of Jerry Springer's show a long time ago	 I had the same reaction I had to Andrew Dice Clay's obscene nursery rhymes; not laughter	 just yawning. Lastly	 I found Springer's pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing. If he really were an advocate of the poor	 he would bring on a single mom from Bed-Sty to talk about trying to raise her kids in New York City on $12	000 a year. Or	 failing that	 he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits. Jerry Springer gets millions for his shows	 his movie	 his book and videos. His guests just get round trip air fare	 hotel accommodations	 and a chance to humiliate themselves. If he liked poor people so much	 he'd give them at least some of the money they earn for him. It appears that Springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself. Jeez	 with all his fine work	 you'd think he'd have earned our respect already. Anyway	 the film is weak and boring. It doesn't even succeed at being offensive. If you want to have a better evening	 videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that."	0.0
it was the worst ending i have ever seen if some one can please tell me how and why the last chick goes crazy and eats the old women in the end. why dose the movie have all those cheap crappy scares in it in the beginning but yet when the first person dies they kill them all off in 5 minutes! most of the people could act but i do give so credit to the porn stars they did their best. also it had a couple funny parts and kills like when the care taker gets his organs riped out of his ass and then gets choked with it. if this movie had an ending that could make any since i would have given it a 8 out of 10 but the ending made no since. the ending sucked but the rest was great	0.0
"In Le Million	 Rene Clair	 one of the cinema's great directors and great pioneers	 created a gem of light comedy which for all its lightness is a groundbreaking and technically brilliant film which clearly influenced subsequent film-makers such as the Marx Brothers	 Lubitsch	 and Mamoulian. The plot	 a witty story of a poor artist who wins a huge lottery jackpot but has to search frantically all over town for the missing ticket	 is basically just a device to support a series of wonderfully witty comic scenes enacted in a dream world of the director's imagination.<br /><br />One of the most impressive things about this film is that	 though it is set in the middle of Paris and includes nothing actually impossible	 it achieves a sustained and involving fairy-tale/fantasy atmosphere	 in which it seems quite natural that people sing as much as they talk	 or that a tussle over a stolen jacket should take on the form of a football game. Another memorable element is that Le Million includes what may be the funniest opera ever put on film (O that blonde-braided soprano! ""I laugh	 ha! ha!"") Also a delight is the casting: Clair has assembled a group of amazing	 sharply different character actors	 each of them illustrating with deadly satiric accuracy a bourgeois French ""type	"" so that the film seems like a set of Daumier prints come to life.<br /><br />The hilarity takes a little while to get rolling	 and I found the characters not as emotionally engaging as they can be even in a light comedy (as they are	 for instance	 in many Lubitsch films.) For these reasons I refrained from giving it the highest rating. But these minor cavils shouldn't distract from an enthusiastic recommendation.<br /><br />Should you see it? By all means. Highly recommended whether you want a classic and influential work of cinema or just a fun comedy."	1.0
"This is a classic example of an increasing problem with films. Why is the background noise and the soundtrack dramatically louder than the dialogue? What sense does that make? This film isn't alone. Most films seem to do this now. For 2 years	 I wondered if it was just something wrong with my TV	 but then I got a new TV & there it is again. BACKGROUND noise that could be taking place a city block behind the actors drowns out the dialogue.<br /><br />It was even more distracting in this film because	 in the English version anyway	 the woman mumbles constantly. I kept hoping Jean Reno would say ""Excuse me	 would you speak up or get the marbles out of your mouth."" If you watch it on DVD & you have even high-school French	 I recommend the French version with subtitles.<br /><br />I give it 4 because Reno was so good in Leon. People rave about the scenery	 but I saw it on a TV & I lived in the Rockies for a few years	 so ""Enh""."	0.0
"This crime thriller is sort of like a film noir	 though changes the context from post-war to Cold War and has something relatively decent to say about humanity. In ""Pickup on South Street""	 policemen are good guys	 criminals are genuine guys	 and the only enemies are ""The Commies""	 who are ultimately differentiated from the good-guys in that they are emotionally personable	 driven by an actual care for their own worth	 as shown in the constant tracked-in close-ups that speckle the movie.<br /><br />This movie revolves around characters. The personalities in this film are rather unique and detailed: Skip the pick-pocket who is able to stare down any danger	 and sometimes while going through their personal possessions; Moe the informer who is just trying to save up for a spectacular funeral	 but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of nearly all the other characters (and the audience); Candy	 the ill-named innocent girl who only thinks she's doing government work and doesn't fully comprehend the conspiracy she's involved with; and Joey	 the ex-boyfriend evil Commie baddie who is trying to hide everything from everybody and	 ironically	 is the worst person at doing it. Throw in a bunch of very colorful supporting characters (such as the guy with the chopsticks and the policemen) and ""Pickup on South Street"" treats you to a splendor of personalities as they hunt down the mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frames.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB"	1.0
"The original movie	 The Odd Couple	 has some wonderful comic one-liners. The entire world it seems knows the story of neurotic neat-freak Felix Ungar and funny	 obnoxious	 slob Oscar Madison. This paring of mismatched roommates created one of the most successful TV series of all time as well as countless	 not anywhere near as good	 imitations.<br /><br />The Odd Couple movie has some wonderful jokes about Oscar's apartment and his sloppy habits. He says	 ""Who wants food?"" One of his poker player buddies asks	 ""What do ya got?"" Oscar says	 ""I got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches."" ""What's the brown?"" It's either very new cheese or very old meat!"" I also love the line about Oscar's refrigerator	 ""It's been out of order for two weeks	 I saw milk standing in there that wasn't even in a bottle!"" There is no question that Walter Matthau's Oscar Madison is a joy to watch on screen. He's almost as good as Jack Klugman's version in the TV series.<br /><br />The problem with the movie is Jack Lemmon's Felix Ungar. Jack makes a very	 very	 honest effort at the role. The problem is that he makes Felix SO depressing and down-trodden that he becomes more annoying than comical. Tony Randall's performance in the series	 brought the kind of humor	 warmth	 and sensitivity	 to Felix's character	 which Lemmon's portrayal lacks. Tony's Felix Unger obviously could be annoying some of the time. However	 in the TV series	 it related to specific situations where the annoyance was needed in the storyline. Jack's Felix Ungar	 (note the different spelling) in the movie	 seems to never be happy	 fun	 or interesting. The movie Felix Ungar is a roommate that drives you up the wall	 all the time.<br /><br />The movie still has great moments that withstand the test of time	 the ""famous"" meatloaf fight is one of the greatest scenes ever! One of the other great examples of Felix's ""little notes"" on Oscar's pillow will be remembered forever. However	 there are some darker sides where Oscar goes over the top	 His ""crying"" near the end after bawling out Felix	 and a scene involving Felix's Linguine dinner	 (although lightened by a funny line.) seem more depressing than comical.<br /><br />Perhaps there wasn't enough time to see the lighter side of these characters that made the series so memorable in the movie. The beginning 20 minutes are very boring. The same issue occurs with Felix's conversation with the Pidgeon Sisters. The movie's ending is predictable and too pat. There's very little care or compassion for each of them by the other. The result is that the darker side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger	 rather than comedy	 unless you are watching the great scenes described above. It appears that Jack Lemmon's monotone persona of Felix brings the film down	 rather than enhances or embraces the comedy between the characters.<br /><br />It really took the 1970's TV series to make The Odd Couple the best that it could be. The original film is still very good. However	 the TV series is much better."	1.0
"I expected a bad movie	 and got a bad movie. But I couldn't really imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was. I don't even want to try to explain what Blood Surf is about. Is not about blood surfing	 but a big a$$ crocodile. They are complaining about the fake shark in Jaws	 but Spielberg was wise and didn't show the shark until the end. Here the crocodile is shown a lot of times	 and it's the worst fake crocodile I have ever seen	 and they don't try to hide it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile watch Lake Placid. <br /><br />The director had an opportunity to make a decent surf/shark movie	 but he had to make a bad b-monster movie. He had the chance to make an original surf movie	 but he wanted to make a monster movie. So you have understand how bad this movie is	 does it have some good parts? Not really	 it got some nudity	 and a sex scene that is taken straight out of a playboy movie. The acting isn't half bad either	 and Kate Fischer looks good. Too bad she doesn't take her top off. The lead actors aren't bad either. They had some potential. The location was beautiful and the movie start good with some nice surf scenes. The blame is on the untalented writer and director. The dialogue is some of the worst I have ever seen	 and the script is really badly written	 and the director got no talent what so ever	 and not much of a fantasy either.<br /><br />Don't watch it. Even if you want to watch the beautiful Kate Fischer. It isn't worth it. Watch Sirens to watch Kate nude	 and watch Lake Placid if you want some good crocodile action.<br /><br />3/10 because I'm in a good mood	 and Maureen Larrazabal looks good naked	 and Kate looks good (but is bad actress	)and Dex Miller	 Joel West and Matt Borlenghi did a good job with the piece of sh#t they had to work with."	0.0

"i love this film. the songs and story lines are great fun. and the song ""saying goodbye"" always moves me. what a brilliant thing to do to bring puppets to life	 in a way that you actually care about these things made of cloth and fabric and whatever. great voices and great talent. why were all the other muppet films that came after this one so much less interesting	 moving and funny? is it that mr. henson is just so very missed?"	1.0
"I have to point out	 before you read this review	 that in no way	 is this a statement against Iranian people ... if you really want to read something into it	 than hopefully you see	 that I'm against politicians in general ... but if you're looking to be offended ... I can't help you!<br /><br />Not in Iran as this movie is banned there (see IMDb trivia for this movie). Which is a shame	 because the movie is great. Would it not be for ""Grbavica""	 this movie would have won at the International Film Festival in Berlin.<br /><br />Rightfully so (it was the runner-up	 or second place if you will). Why? Because it is a movie about oppression. It's not even that this is a complete women issue. It is about the government trying to keep the people down. An analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie. But by banning it nothing is resolved and/or can they make this movie disappear! <br /><br />Another reviewer had a great summary line: ""Comedy about a tragedy""	 that sums it up pretty well!"	1.0
"THE TENANTS began as a 1971 short novel by the now deceased Bernard Malamud - writer/philosopher - examining the conflicts between Jews and African Americans in the incendiary atmosphere of Brooklyn at the time the book was written. As a novel the story was gut wrenchingly real: as transcribed into a screenplay by novices David Diamond and Danny Green (who also directs) it is more of a cerebral dissertation that gradually erupts into action in the final moments.<br /><br />Harry Lesser (Dylan McDermott) is a Jewish novelist with one book under his belt but currently attempting to finish his 'newest' book ten years into the writing. Convinced that he must complete the novel in the same environment where it was started. he is the sole tenant in a condemned Brooklyn tenement owned by Levinspiel (Seymour Cassel) who constantly tries to 'buy out' Harry's lease so that the filthy dilapidated building can be demolished. Into this atmosphere enters another Black militant quasi-anti-Semitic writer Willie Spearmint (Snoop Dogg) whom Harry befriends	 hides	 and offers help to the nascent novelist's attempt to write about the death of all white people. Harry's attempts to help Willie lead to conflict	 not the least of which is Harry's meeting Willie's girlfriend	 the white Jewish Irene Bell (Rose Byrne) at a less than friendly gathering of Willie's militant black brothers and sisters. Willie and Irene are on the skids and Harry gradually falls in love with Irene and they plan to leave New York as soon as Harry finishes his novel. When Willie hears of the assignation and is further critiqued by Harry	 Willie explodes and begins the downward descent of not only a delicate friendship but also a competition between writers. The ending 'reveals the slippery nature of the human condition	 and the human capacity for violence and undoing'.<br /><br />The actors do their best with a script that is a bit awkward but despite scripted lines that border on preaching they create believable characters. The cinematography enhances the story	 keeping the mood dank and dense and primarily confined to the condemned building. The musical score appropriately makes use of the solo jazz trumpet and blues piano to underline the tension and isolation of each of these groundless characters. Though it takes some patience to make it through the cerebral ramblings	 the film in the end is worth watching. At least it attempts to recreate Malamud's bizarre look at life in the big city.

A question for you : A family go to a new house and get stalked by demonic forces . Which film am I talking about ? Every horror film you`ve seen ? Yes that`s true but that`s not the answer I`m looking for . I`ll narrow it down by saying there`s a lot of teen angst scenes . Doesn`t help ? Well there`s lots of bits where the characters are stalked by a creature and you see the characters through the creature`s POV . No futher forward ? Okay there`s a dream sequence involving lots of blood ? Could still be any horror film you say . Oh gawd this could take weeks so I`ll say the film I`m talking about features loads of Aussies many of whom have appeared in NEIGHBOURS and HOME AND AWAY . Yes that`s right the film is THE THIRD CIRCLE ( aka CUBBYHOUSE ) and do you understand what the above exercise is about ? It`s about me pointing out how THE THIRD CIRCLE is absolutely no different from any horror film that`s been made	0.0
"- A newlywed couple move into the home of the husband's dead former wife. It's not long before the new wife begins to have the feeling that someone doesn't want her in the house. She sees skulls all around the house. But when the husband investigates	 he can't find anything. Is someone trying to drive her back to the asylum that she was recently discharged from? Or	 is the ghost of the dead wife trying to get the new wife out of her house? <br /><br />- This is the first time that I've watched The Screaming Skull without the assistance of the MST3K crew. And	 it will in all likelihood be the last time I watch it this way. Can you say dull? I'm not talking ordinary dull - I'm talking watching grass grow dull. There are great stretches of the movie where nothing happens. The screen could have gone blank and I would have gotten as much entertainment out of it. The characters drone on and on with the most monotonous conversations imaginable. The Screaming Skull could probably be marketed as a sleep aide.<br /><br />- The actors don't help matters much. Most of them deliver lines with the conviction normally reserved for a grade school play. I haven't looked it up	 but I would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this movie ever appeared in anything of cinematic value. I won't even go into the script the actors are given to work with. Let's just say that the characters are given some of the most idiotic lines ever uttered on film.<br /><br />- You've been warned! Either avoid this one at all costs or	 at least	 seek out the MST3K version."	0.0
"My baby sitter was a fan so I saw many of the older episodes while growing up. I'm not a fan of Scooby Doo so I'm not sure why I left the TV on when this show premiered. To my surprise I found it enjoyable. To me Shaggy and Scooby were the only interesting characters *dodges tomatoes from fans of the others* so I like that they only focus on those two. However	 this may cause fans of the original shows to hate it. I like the voice acting	 especially Dr. Phinius Phibes. I liked listening to him even before I knew he was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen as Robi sounds to me like he's really enjoying his job as an actor. I also get a kick out of the techies with their slightly autistic personalities and their desires to play Dungeons and Dragons or act out scenes from Star Wars (not called by those names in the show	 of course)."	1.0
"A hilarious Neil Simon comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end. The late Walter Matthau is the grouchy ex-comedian who is persuaded to join together with his ex-partner (the late Oscar-winner George Burns) for a final reunion show on stage.<br /><br />Benjamin Martin is Matthau's agent and nephew	 and the two have just as much chemistry as Matthau and Burns. I love Matthau's grumpy character--he's just the same as he always is	 and yet also very different.<br /><br />Burns	 as the absent-minded old man	 is just as funny as Matthau.<br /><br />Matthau: Want some crackers? I've got coconut	 pineapple and graham.<br /><br />Burns: How about a plain cracker?<br /><br />Matthau: I don't got plain. I got coconut	 pineapple and graham.<br /><br />Burns: Okay<br /><br />Matthau: They're in the cupboard in the kitchen.<br /><br />Burns: Maybe later.<br /><br />Or how about this:<br /><br />Matthau: When I did black	 the whites knew what I was saying!<br /><br />You've got to see it in the movie to understand it!<br /><br />All in all	 a refreshingly hilarious	 sweet	 heartfelt	 warm	 belivable character comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time. <br /><br />They just don't make them like this anymore! In a time when all the newest comedies are crude	 juvenile and stupid	 this leans back towards the tender core of what comedy really is--funny characters	 smart and funny dialogue	 and grand entertainment.<br /><br />One of the best buddy comedies of all time	 right up there with ""Planes	 Trains and Automobiles	"" ""Lethal Weapon	"" and ""The Hard Way.""<br /><br />You may have a hard time finding this for rent or on TV	 but trust me	 it will be worth your time!<br /><br />4.5/5 stars.<br /><br />- John Ulmer"	1.0

"If there has ever been a worse comedy than 'Gray Matters' I am unaware of it. The New York Jewish comedy's 'funny' premise is that siblings Sam & Gray are mistaken for a couple and so decide to fix Sam up with a girlfriend	 only to find that Gray is equally attracted to their target - Charlie. The revelation that Gray is secretly gay is apparently only a surprise to her. There is a deeply offensive wedding sequence	 a deeply embarrassing 'drunk act' from Moynahan and Graham	 and a performance that would embarrass forests everywhere for its woodenness from Tom Cavanagh. Sissy Spacek demonstrates a complete inability to do comedy and will want this excised from her resume. Molly Shannon plays the homely friend with lumpen insouciance. Only Alan Cumming emerges with any credit but is seriously under-employed and given nothing with which to work. The whole disaster is cemented by Graham's bizarre eye-rolling performance culminating with the penultimate scene where she wears a comedy hat and an overcoat despite the scene being set in a lesbian bar. It is astonishing that this film was ever released it has no redeeming feature and should be avoided at all costs."	0.0
"Human Tornado (1976) is in many ways a better film than it's predecessor. The director knew what he had to work with and catered towards Rudy Ray Moore's limitations as an actor. It's a fun movie that's more technically sound and acted. The performers don't take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time around everyone is on the joke and goes with the flow. Rudy Ray Moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and not as stiff like he was in Dolemite.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film very much and I highly recommend it. Just like his first film	 it's catered towards a certain audience (I highly doubt that Mr. Moore was trying to broaden his audience at this point in his career). Check it out!<br /><br />Highjly recommended."	1.0
"My wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story	 having read it to several of her classes. It never sounded all that interesting to me	 though	 and I bought the DVD figuring this would be a movie that wouldn't really be up my alley.<br /><br />The first half of the movie has a lot of set-up and I found myself thinking that I was right. It starts off a bit slow and I have to admit that I was a little bit bored - but curious enough to stay with it. Boy	 am I glad I did because this ended up being a very satisfying and rewarding movie. I would most certainly watch this again!<br /><br />The casting was very good. Since I haven't read the book	 I can't vouch for accuracy	 but I have to say that Jon Voight was truly delightful. You liked the characters you were supposed to like	 hated the ones you were supposed to hate	 and laughed at the ones that were supposed to be funny.<br /><br />I can see how some folks might not like this movie. It is tedious at times	 especially in the beginning. All the flashbacks can be distracting (though they are essential to the story). Once the story starts to come together at the end	 though	 I think you're paid back in spades for your patience. When all is said and done	 I think this is a very good movie - 8/10.<br /><br />"	1.0
"David Lean's worst film. Even 'In Which We Serve' was'nt as bad as this. Usually a film with a really good reputation like this one	 has at least some redeeming qualities	 which makes one understand why it might be considered a classic. But after watching this I just could not get why this piece of crap was liked so much even back in 1945! I disliked the acting	 stiff upper lip British mannerisms	 story	 script (which may be quite witty at times but totally unfunny) and soundtrack. The elvira character is meant to be alluring and attractive	 but was in actual fact ugly and had a weird and annoying voice. Just another film that has convinced me not to trust a films reputation. Another very overrated 'british classic'."	0.0
"When The Matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity	 it was expected that a lot of movies would use it as inspiration. That didn't really happen	 surprisingly	 and it took till 2002 for a movie of similar theme to appear. But to say Cypher is a clone would be to its discredit.<br /><br />The story is of a Morgan Sullivan	 who applies for a job with a high-flying techno-company called Digicorp. His job is to be a spy and gain information about a rival company	 while under an assumed and false identity. His home-life is perfectly normal but he has to lie to his wife about what he's actually doing. However	 things start to take conspirital turns and before he knows what's going on	 he starts to question who he actually is. This is not helped by a strange woman who turns up...<br /><br />Twists and turns at every direction keep you absolutely fascinated	 and at no point does anything ever seem contrived or unbelievable.<br /><br />It's an enthralling journey through a not-too-distant future	 and with good acting all round will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Highly recommended."	1.0
"Oh man	 what was Sam Mraovich thinking? What was anyone who was involved in this ""film"" thinking? Mraovich is the head of nearly everything of ""Ben and Arthur"": Director	 writer	 producer (also EXECUTIVE producer!)	 caster	 lead star- you name it	 he did it. And he (Mraovich) sucks more than anyone has ever sucked in every department of film making.<br /><br />So what is wrong with this film? Everything. The film is about two gay lovers	 Ben (Jamie Brett Gabel) and Arthur (Mraovich- *groan*). Ben and Arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gay people. To make things worse	 Ben's crazy ""ex-wife"" (they don't exactly divorce)	 Tammy (Julie Belknap) is steaming mad that Ben's left her for another man and demands Ben that they get back together (saying that she can be gay	 too!) and Arthur's Christian devoted	 excessively hypocritical	 equally batty as Tammy brother	 Victor	 is hell bent on making Arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after he gets kicked out of his church.<br /><br />The film is absolutely chock a block with so many goofs (ie. Ben and Arthur fly to Vermont to get married- they go there on Alaska Airlines and Vermont has palm trees; they fly back on a FedEx cargo plane- hope they were comfy in a wooden crate	 plus many	 many more) and plot holes to boot (Victor calls killing Arthur ""The Final Plan"" which later changes to ""The Final Deed""; Arthur and the private (intern) detective drive the same car	 blah	 blah	 blah). The ""actors"" are all very bad and are way	 way over the top; the script is laughably horrible(one such example is ""I don't make sense? You don't make sense! I make sense	 that's who makes sense!"") and there so much more wrong with the ""movie"" that I can't write them all down.<br /><br />However	 the most laughable yet unbelievable thing about ""Ben and Arthur"" is that Sam Mraovich thinks that he has created something that is truly fantastic (see his fake reviews for ""Ben & Arthur"" and obvious comments by him on YouTube.). Mraovich is narcissistic and his arrogance blinds him from seeing how awful anything with his name on it really is.<br /><br />So	 to conclude	 forget every bad film that you claim is the worst movie ever- ""Ben and Arthur"" will knock them right off that title	 even Paris Hilton movies look like ""The Dark Knight"" compared to the monstrosity known as ""Ben and Arthur""."	0.0

Another stupid dinosaur movie in which top secret military guys discover those lethal (and very fake-looking) prehistoric monsters running around killing people in gory ways. The original was bad enough	 the sequel was even worse. This falls somewhere in between	 though unrelated to either of the previous CARNOSAUR films. RATING: 2 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and gore	 grisly images	 and profanity."	0.0
"It's a road movie	 with a killer on-board. Brian Kessler (David Duchovny)	 a sophisticated	 urbane writer	 wants to conduct field research on American serial killers. But	 neither he	 nor his girlfriend	 Carrie (Michelle Forbes)	 has the money for a cross-country tour of murder sites	 so they advertise for someone to share travel expenses. Who they end up with is a young couple	 Early Grayce (Brad Pitt) and his girlfriend	 Adele (Juliette Lewis)	 two better examples of ""poor white trash"" you will never find in all of cinema.<br /><br />Indeed	 Early and Adele are what make this film so entertaining	 as they babble	 cackle	 confide	 muse	 speculate	 drool	 and otherwise behave in ways I haven't seen since reruns of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"". Early's idea of California: ""People think faster out there	 on account of all that warm weather; cold weather makes people stupid"". That's enough to convince Adele: ""I guess that explains why there are so many stupid people around here"". To which Early responds proudly: ""It sure does"". Early continues to instruct Adele about California: ""You never have to buy no fruit	 on account it's all on the trees ... and they ain't got no speed limits	 and I hear your first month's rent is free	 state law"".<br /><br />But poor Early has some	 well	 mental problems	 which become ever more obvious to Brian and Carrie as the four travelers proceed west across the U.S. As they enter the desert Southwest	 with its beautifully stark landscape	 ""Kalifornia"" starts to look more and more like ""The Hitcher"" (1986)	 and Early starts to act more and more like John Ryder	 everyone's maniacal hitchhiker	 whose terror seemed so unstoppable.<br /><br />In ""Kalifornia""	 the acting is uneven. Duchovny's performance is flat. Brad Pitt is surprisingly effective	 despite his overacting at times. Michelle Forbes is great as the avant-garde	 photographic artist. But my choice for best performance goes to Juliette Lewis. With her nasal voice and heavy-duty Southern accent	 she is stunning	 as the naive	 highly animated	 child-like Adele.<br /><br />Toward the end	 the film takes on a Twilight Zone feel to it	 as our travelers enter a Nevada nuclear test site with a dilapidated old house full of test mannequins. The plot dissolves rather messily into unnecessary and preposterous violence	 an ending that was somewhat disappointing.<br /><br />Overall	 however	 ""Kalifornia"" is an entertaining film	 thanks to a clever concept	 great scenery	 especially in the second half	 good cinematography	 great dialogue	 and that wonderful performance by Juliette Lewis."	1.0
"I am very open to foreign films and like to think that I grasp what they are trying to accomplish although some things are lost in translation. But the simplicity and ""intelligence"" of this film were boring. I've often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or time period that really had no point. Now that I've seen a movie like that I will no longer be thinking along those lines. There's tones about society	 racism	 and some desire...but South Park has that. And when I watch South Park it actually moves me to feel an emotion. The closest thing I felt to an emotion during this movie was the yawn I experienced after the first five minutes. I rate the typical movie a seven or above because I love most every film. I gave this film a one."	0.0
"As others have mentioned	 all the women that go nude in this film are mostly absolutely gorgeous. The plot very ably shows the hypocrisy of the female libido.

And the boy becomes a man really fast (we should all be so lucky at this age!). He then gets up the courage to pursue his true love."	1.0
"This is the biggest Flop of 2008. I don know what Director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster. The songs have been added without situations	 the story have been stretched to fill the 3 hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it's like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with 100 people. Only the best performance was by Anil Kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking Hinglish... Akki is also done a good job....

"This was a great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in IMDb) but he made a great matchmaker. He brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working. The supporting cast (Lou Jacobi	 Joseph Maher	 Gene Saks	 Stephen Fry	 etc.) all clicked on screen and made this a great viewing experience. The fact he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to get around. And did he wear socks in one scene...reportedly	 the professor never wore socks! (Two new entries for the IMDb goofs section.) Historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside	 this was a great movie to watch with a great cast. I give it an 8!"	1.0
"I started watching the show from the first season	 and at the beginning I was pretty skeptical about it. Original movie was kind of childish	 and I was just looking for some sci-fi show while waiting for the BSG new season.<br /><br />But after few episodes I became a fan. I've loved the characters - the not-so-stupid-as-you-think-he-is Jack O'Neill	 the not-only-smart Samantha Carter	 the glorious Teal'c	 women and kids favorite	 and brilliant Dr. Daniel Jackson.<br /><br />Of course	 stories sometimes not serious	 sometimes even ridiculous	 but mostly it's not about technology or space fighting - it's about helping your friend	 even risking your life for him. It's about ""we don't leave anybody behind"". Struggling to the end when all hope is lost. About the free will	 and all good qualities that makes a human - Human.<br /><br />And now it's breaking a record	 going 10th season	 and still doing good."	1.0
"""Pandora's Clock"" is a gripping suspense/thriller that's a cross between a virus movie and a disaster film. This movie	 which aired in two parts on NBC in its debut showing in 1996	 is about an airplane flight that becomes infected with a virus when one of the passengers just happens to be carrying this disease. The U.S. Government debates on whether the plane should be destroyed or not	 while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) try to figure something out to avoid disaster. I'm not really a big fan of TV movies and miniseries	 but I liked ""Pandora's Clock"". It's one heck of a thrill ride. Jane Leeves (TV's ""Frasier"")	 Robert Loggia	 and Edward Herrmann (as the President) also star.<br /><br />*** (out of four)"	1.0

"This is indeed a god adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Compared with the American Version with Guinneth Paltrow	 the script was written to resemble as much as possible the book. But the acting was awful. Besides Kate Beckinsale	 who I believe was a true likeness of the Emma in the book	 all the other actors were trying too hard. Mark Strong was not the ""gentleman"" he was supposed to be. He was often rude and offensive	 had no feeling whatsoever	 and throughout the entire film you could not see his love ""growing"" for Emma at all. This had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale	 who seemed to be trying to ""resque"" her leading role as well as her partner's. Moreover	 there was no chemistry between the entire cast. Hariett Smith	 played by Samantha Morton	 seemed to have no real attachment to Mr. Elton	 played by Dominic Rowan. Therefore	 she did not seem as heartbroken as she was portrayed in the book. The settings of the film are also too poor. The costumes are even more so. I would have imagined Emma Woodhouse to dress in a more fashionable and elegant way that she does here. The ending is also too long. It is good that it resembles the book's ending	 but it is a killer ending for a film. And again	 I can see no feeling of happiness in the face of Mr.Knightley. To conclude	 I believed this adaptation to be loyal to the book	 but with poor actors. It seemed as if the film was made without any budget at all. I would prefer to see the ""lighter"" version with Paltrow and Northam	 even if it is clear that it was made to be a ""blockbuster""	 than to watch these actors (excepting the good Olivia Williams and the better Kate Beckinsale) ruin the entire script."	0.0
"OK - you want to test somebody on how comfortable they are with their adolescence and the embarrassing and maniacal changes therin - then get their immediate reaction from watching this uproarious doc about kids making socially relevant horror flicks in the suburban 80's. More than any movie I has ever seen	 the film deals with burdening sexuality and ego in a way that is completely human	 never dull	 and flushed in the kind of inherent goodness of youth that is discolored by the fear-frenzied adult world where any quirk in youth is accredited to anything from insanity to perversion. Mini-mogul Darren Stien seems to be reaching for a deeper understanding of his triumphs and misgivings as the patriarch of strict kid's world. What he finds in himself and others isn't always pretty - but shows how one can improve and reconcile with age. What does change mean without reflection. I love this movie."	1.0
"""Gespenster"" (2005) forms	 together with ""Yella"" (2007)	 and ""Jerichow"" (2008)	 the Gespenster-trilogy of director Christian Petzold	 doubtless one of the creme-De-la-creme German movie directors of our time.<br /><br />Roughly	 ""Gespenster"" tells the story of a French woman whose daughter had been kidnapped as a 3 years old child while the mother turned around her head for 1 minute in Berlin - and has never been seen ever. Since then	 the mother keeps traveling to Berlin whenever there is a possibility and searches	 by aid of time-dilated photography	 for girls of the age of approximately the present age of her age. As we hear later in the movie	 the mother was already a lot of times convinced that she had found her daughter Marie. However	 this time	 when she meets Nina	 everything comes quite different.<br /><br />The movie does not bring solutions	 not even part-solutions	 and insofar	 it is rather disappointing. We are not getting equipped either in order to decide if the mother is really insane or not	 if her actual daughter is still alive or not. Most disappointing is the end. After what we have witnessed in the movie	 it is an imposition for the watcher that he is let alone as the auteur leaves Nina alone. The simple walking away symbolizing that nothing has changed	 can be a strong effect of dramaturgy (f.ex. in ""Umberto D."")	 but in ""Gespenster""	 it is displaced.<br /><br />Since critics have been suggesting Freudian motives in this movie	 let me give my own attempt: Why is it that similar persons do not know one another	 especially not the persons that another similar person knows? This is quite an insane question	 agreed	 from the standpoint of Aristotelian logic	 according to which the notion of the individual holds. The individual is such a person that does not share any of its defining characteristics with anyone else. So	 the Aristotelian answer to my question is: They do not know one another because their similarity is by pure change. Everybody who is not insane	 believes that. However	 what about the case if these similar persons share other similarities which can hardly be by change	 e.g. scarfs on their left under ankle or a heart-shaped birthmark under their right shoulder-blade? This is the metaphysical context out of which this movie is made	 although I am not sure whether even the director has realized that. Despite our modern	 Aristotelian world	 the superstition	 conserved in the mythologies of people around the globe that similar people also share parts of their individuality	 and that individuality	 therefore	 is not something erratic	 but rather diffusional	 so that the borders between persons are open	 such and similar believes build a strong backbone of irrational-ism despite our otherwise strongly rational thinking - a source of Gespenster of the most interesting kind."	1.0
"Here I thought ""Nanook of the north"" was the last word in archaic semi-doc 'eskimo' movies. How wrong! As an avid sea-kayaker I stayed up till 330am to watch this hoping to get a glimpse of some hand-made 'skin-boats'. The movie did not let me down. Any student of kayak/umiak construction should have a look-see here. (Note to fellow SKers: they appear to be using Norton Sound kayaks with single blade paddles).<br /><br />But the film went way beyond this admittedly narrow interest. Even though there were as others have noted some little back-shot-fakey-bits the movie has so much heart they are just a minor annoyance. It was (from this very amateur anthropologist's viewpoint) probably the perfect time to make this movie. Early thirties: the 'talkies' are so new that they (including Louie B. Mayer!) actually let the Inuit speak in their own tongue. And there is so much that was still	 despite the infused melodrama	 authentic. They are really whacking that polar bear	 that whale and those caribou. A fifties version of this film would have been so cheesy with 'stars'	 Technicolor	 etc. to gum it up. The seventies version? Don't even. A very good companion piece to this excellent movie is ""White shadows in the south seas"" (1928) Geograpically the mirror image to ""Eskimo"" it also deals with the relentless and profound disruption of Western culture/technology on an unsuspecting people."	1.0
"'Maladolescenza' has the air of a dark fairy tale	 with its child protagonists	 forest setting	 and the discovery of a castle's ruins. Yet at its core	 the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study of adolescents. Opening with a dream sequence employing the not-so-subtle metaphor of Fabrizio wrestling with his menacing hound	 the film details his psychological persecution of Laura	 the girl who has pledged her love to him	 and his eventual romance with the equally malicious Sylvia. The film's psychological complexities do give the film merit	 yet there's no doubting how unnecessarily exploitive the film is in its depiction of nudity and sex. The film's look relies more on its gorgeous locations rather than particular cinematographic skill	 and there's no doubting the film's greatest asset is the creepy	 children's choir-augmented soundtrack. With its odd dreamlike quality	 the film is at best interesting	 yet pales beside Louis Malle's surreal and brilliant 'Black Moon' from the same era. Certainly deserving of the art versus pornography debate	 for unlike many banned films	 Pasolini's 'Salo' or Larry Clark's 'Ken Park' for instance	 the film is rather unremarkable from an artistic perspective. Cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock	 so perhaps 'Maladolescenza' should be admired for retaining that power thirty years after its release.

Piper's Violet Stanford and Karen Friendly (Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle) both have a virgin kindegarden teacher quality to them that's endearing. Here's hoping she'll find a better movie to be in."	0.0
"The complaints are valid	 to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women. I am okay with these night time soaps	 like Grey's Anatomy	 or Ugly Betty	 or West Wing	 because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end. However	 when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men (Taye Diggs	 Tim Daly	 and Chris Lowell) into sexual tension and romps	 and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital	 it seems like General Hospital...or a female counterpart to Baywatch. That was what men wanted and they had it	 so if this is what women want so be it	 but the idea that this is a high brow show (or something men will watch) is unrealistic."	0.0
"A family traveling for their daughter's softball league decide to take the 'scenic route' and end up in the middle of nowhere. The father is an avid photographer	 and when he hears of an old abandoned side show in the town	 he decides to take another detour to take some photographs.<br /><br />Of course	 the side show is filled with inbred freaks	 who promptly kidnap the women and leave the young son and father to fend for themselves.<br /><br />The only cool thing about this film is how the family actually fights back against their inbred captors. Other than that	 there's nothing worthwhile about the film."	0.0
"I think Dark Angel is great! First season was excellent	 and had a good plot. With Max(Jessica Alba) as an escaped X-5	 manticore creation	 trying to adapt to a normal life	 but still ""saving the world"". And being hunted by manticore throughout the season which gives the series some extra spice.<br /><br />The second season though suddenly became a bit odd compared to the first. The plot kinda disappeared	 and the series lost a little of it's charm	 mostly because of all the weird ""creatures"" appearing. Don't get me wrong the second season is good	 but with a little bit to much of the ""manticores"". However	 they managed to get back to a new promising plot in the closing episodes of season 2	 in which I had a lot of hopes to see more of.<br /><br />So I really wish they could start making new episodes. And with James Cameron behind this it can't go wrong. So as a conclusion I would say it's a great series	 however I'm still hoping for a third season!"	1.0
"How truly friendly	 charming and cordial is this unpretentious old serial; I rejoiced in seeing old Lugosi. It is disarmingly friendly and lively. It's the document of a longlost craft. (The best TV series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good serials.) CHANDU is deeply	 deeply optimistic and hedonistic . It refreshes the mind. It's not stupid; stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of simple	 unpretentious and friendly fun.<br /><br />Without giving away too muchChandu is an Occidental sorcerer who goes also by this Eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killers.<br /><br />Chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate way.<br /><br />As to the quite sexy niece	 Nadji	 she is kidnapped by the priest of Ubasti: the sordid Vindhyan. The poor sexy girl is in fact multiply kidnappedin a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower; almost kidnapped from a boat; by a phony policeman; the temple of Lemuria and its strange	 creepy ceremonies resemble the KING KONG imageryand are a barbaric mockery of the RCC ceremonies and rituals. <br /><br />Would you protect a girl as bravely as Chandu does?<br /><br />Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless	 mean drunk	 and this only contributed to his performances. He is the prototypical mean drunk uncle	 mischievous and cunning and oblique. This might sound like a rather crooked homage to Lugosiyet Burton's biopic of Wood left me this impression about Lugosi and allied to it a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor. I enjoy Lugosi' fancy performances.<br /><br />This serial is unjustly bashed."	1.0
"Extremely dull drama starring a very young Roddy McDowall	 who trains a wild horse	 the Flicka of the title	 and is the only reason for watching the movie in the first place. Coated in blaring	 overbearing music and weighed down by schmaltzy dialogue	 this is one of those interminable films that bores you to the point of a gnawing headache. The naffly-titled sequel	 'Thunderhead	 Son of Flicka'	 in which McDowall trains the next generation of nag	 is marginally better than the original but the pace remains slow and the score continues to pummel you into submission	 although there are at least one or two scenes that don't induce a coma."	0.0
"This is an excellent little film about the loneliness of the single man. Phillipe Harel as Notre Heros is a bit like an amalgam of Robert de Niro in Taxi Driver	 Inspector Clouseau (in his stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner in Being There (also Peter Sellers). He is single yet doesn't have a clue how to attract the opposite sex - in fact	 he really makes no effort at all!<br /><br />He has a stoicism and fatalism that defies any hope of ever achieving coupledom - his friend Jose Garcia as Tisserand is in the same plight yet at least makes a brave effort to transcend his extended virginhood (he's 28 and admits he's never had sex).<br /><br />Very good outdoor shots of Paris and Rouen	 where the two software people travel on business. They try various nightclubs and places but all to no avail. My theory is that they're trying the wrong places - they go to more-or-less 'youth' nightclubs; they should try the type that has older people	 more their own age.<br /><br />Harel increasingly becomes isolated and does a little de Niro effort	 as in Taxi Driver	 urging his friend/colleague to go and stab some bloke who's pulled a nice-looking girl in the nightclub.<br /><br />Worth watching."	1.0
"Like most other reviewers I have first seen this movie (on TV	 never on the big screen)	 when I was a teenager. My Dad has always regarded this film highly and recommended it to me then	 and I must say he was not only right	 but this movie has stayed with me forever in the more than 2 decades since I saw it first time. I have seen it two or three more times since then (just a few days ago I gave it another watch) and it has not lost anything of its impact with time. It still a great and well worth to be seen movie! Manr regard Peckinpah's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY as one of the first and best later western	 which had a realistic look at life in the old west	 but the hardly known LAST HUNT is definitely the better movie and was even half a dozen years earlier. Actually it was probably 3 decades ahead of its time	 or maybe it still is ...<br /><br />Although thinking hard and having certainly seen 100s of western (I like this genre) I can not remember any western as bleak and depressive as this one. Two men bound together	 partly by hate	 partly by not seeming to have other choices	 surrounded by beautiful Ms. Padget	 a crippled old man and a young Inian	 leading the life of buffalo-killers until fate reaches out for one of them.<br /><br />Nobody who has ever seen this movie will be able to forget its ending and the last frames of this gem. When the camera moves on and away from Mr. Taylor a white buffalo skin comes into sight (on a tree)and echos from the past	 when all the hatred began	 are present again. Mr. Taylor has got his buffalo	 but in the end the buffalo got him. <br /><br />Aside from the top performances of everybody involved	 the intelligent script and the great dialogue	 it should also be mentioned	 that THE LAST HUNT is superbly photograped	 I have seldomely seen a western that well shot (aside from the ones directed by Anthony Mann	 which are also all superbly photographed)	 that all the locations are cleverly chosen and that even the soundtrack fits the picture very well.<br /><br />And director BROOKS is really a superb storyteller. Master craftsmanship!He has made quite a couple of really great movies and was successful in nearly every imaginable genre	 but even in an as prolific career as this one	 THE LAST HUNT still shines as one of his best	 if not his best.<br /><br />Definitely would deserve a higher rating	 compared to the 7-something RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY enjoys."	1.0
"The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu starring Peter Sellers in a spoof of the characters created by Sax Rohmer is an injustice to the end of Sellers' career. The plot was very simplistic	 and if done the right way could have been handled nicely	 but instead it was poorly executed. Part of the reasons why this film wasn't that good was the poor dialog	 cheap laughs	 choppy directing	 and an awkward feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete.<br /><br />The acting	 on the other hand	 was really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed up picture. I found Sellers portrayal of diabolical Manchu brilliantly done	 with the occasional lines that will be remembered. For example	 there is the scene where Fu Manchu is confused which henchman is which in which he says ""Ah	 you all look the same to me."" I hate to admit it	 but I laughed out loud with that line.<br /><br />Then of course a fistful of strong supporting characters really caught my attention with the likes of Helen Mirren as the backstabbing constable	 David Tomilson as Sir Roger Avery (his last film as well	 not a way to end a career)	 and Sid Ceasar (who gives a rather whimsical performance of Al Capone's relative who works for the FBI). These characters also kept me watching.<br /><br />The sets were also nice. Oriental designs and English society in 1933 was depicted with elegance in this dud-of-a-picture.<br /><br />In all honesty	 my advice to you is to watch the film if you are a Peter Sellers or Sid Ceasar fan. Otherwise	 you're better off settling on chewing aluminum foil."	0.0
"Currently	 this film is listed on IMDb as the 42nd worst film ever made--which is exactly why I rented it from NetFlix. However	 I am saddened to report that the film	 while bad	 is no where near bad enough to merit being in the bottom 100 films ever made list. I have personally seen at least 100 films worse than this one. Hardly a glowing endorsement	 but it just didn't meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous list.<br /><br />The film begin with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew on their belated honeymoon (by the way	 they are married in real life as well). He's a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave. Once there	 they behave very	 very	 very stupidly (hallmark of a bad film) and are soon bitten by a bat. According to this film	 bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the US--both of which are not true at all.<br /><br />Oddly	 after being bitten	 the man doesn't even bother going to the hospital!! The first thing on anyone's mind (especially a doctor) is to get medical help immediately	 but not this boob. Soon	 he's having seizures--yet he STILL isn't interested in seeking help! Again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history!! <br /><br />After a while	 he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital. But	 by then it's too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood. When it's totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine	 the wife (who	 like her husband	 has a grapefruit for a brain) refuses to believe he's dangerous--even after he attacks people	 steals an ambulance and runs a police car off the road!! <br /><br />Now most of the time Moss is going through these episodes	 his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person. Oddly	 however	 a couple times he develops bat-like hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite bat-like. Had this been really cheesy	 the film would have merited a 1.<br /><br />In the very end	 in a twist that hardly made any sense at all	 the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff. How all this was arranged was a mystery as was Moss' and McAndrew's belief that this film would somehow help their careers--though they both have had reasonably long careers on TV playing bit roles since 1974.<br /><br />Overall	 very dumb. The plot is silly and makes no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real. Not a good film at all	 but not among the worst films of all time either.<br /><br />NOTE: For some reason	 IMDb shows the graphic for the three DVD set for IT'S ALIVE and it's two sequels of the web page for THE BAT PEOPLE. While THE BAT PEOPLE has been seen with the title ""It's Alive""	 the two movies are not at all related. It's easy to understand the mistake--especially since they both came out in 1974	 but the movie I just reviewed starred Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew and the other film starred John Ryan and Sharon Farrell."	0.0
"The finale of the Weissmuller Tarzan movies is a rather weak one. There are a few things that derail this film.<br /><br />First	 Tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals. In my opinion	 any footwear on Tarzan	 whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes portrayed	 takes away from the character	 which is supposed to be anti-civilization and pro-jungle.<br /><br />Second	 the character of Benji	 as mentioned in a previous post	 totally derails the movie as the comic foil. To me	 his character is unnecessary to the film's plot.<br /><br />Also	 while Weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure as Tarzan	 it's apparent that he was not in his best shape. Although in his later Jungle Jim movies	 his physique had improved somewhat from this film.<br /><br />The octopus battle is a terrific idea	 but I think it should have been done in an earlier Weissmuller film when he was at his physical peak. Likewise	 the battle	 which takes only 30 seconds tops	 would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in Tarzan and His Mate.<br /><br />And while Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye	 it doesn't manage to salvage this last Weissmuller film - a disappointing ending to a great character run."	0.0
"I think a lot of people just wrote this off as another one of Tom Cruise's weird movies (Magnolia	 Eyes Wide Shut) but Vanilla Sky is definitely its own movie. Many people said it was weird; it wasn't. It was different and confusing but not weird. Weird is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. Different is The Truman Show. Confusing is The Matrix or The Game. And unlike Kubrick	 this movie has a conclusion. Everything makes sense -- maybe not immediately	 maybe not even today	 but it will make sense. Vanilla Sky is confusing because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. THAT'S the point. That's where the so-called ""weirdness"" that turned critics away came in. If they had bothered to ""open [their] eyes"" as the original 1997 Spanish movie	 they would have seen that. And if that's not enough reason to see it	 go see it for the music. Cameron Crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack; he uses it to set the ""feel"" -- that notorious element that many movies lack. With songs like The Beach Boys' ""Good Vibrations"" playing at the dramatic and emotional climax of the movie	 he creates an offbeat	 yet astoundingly ""right"" feel. A wonderful film	 in its script	 music	 acting	 and images	 Vanilla Sky is sadly	 a superficial bandwagon movie that critics chide in order to appear intelligent. Excellent: A+"	1.0
"During the early 1980's	 Kurt Thomas was something of a hero in the United States. Inevitably	 men in his position get offered film roles that exist solely to capitalize on that. I have no idea what Thomas was paid to make this film	 but I would have to be paid a big heap of money to agree to make a national fool of myself in a motion picture. The film is obviously derived from ""Enter The Dragon	"" as are most martial arts pictures. Only instead of a real martial art	 they concoct an absurd new martial art	 accurately described by one critic as ""a cross between Kung Fu and break dancing."" A gymnast (Thomas	 of course) is hired to rescue some lady from an impenetrable fortress	 yet every room has a prop that is exactly what Thomas needs to kick the assistant baddies. Of course	 he fights his way to the lead villain	 and of course they have a fancy-dancy fight	 with an ending that will surprise only those who have never seen a marshal arts film. There are touches which nostalgic types will like	 particularly the mullet haircuts of Thomas and many of the male co-stars have. But the only reason to watch this film is if you have a grudge against Kurt Thomas	 who now wishes he had never set foot on the film set."	0.0
"What a terrible movie. Rotten tomatoes had a good rating for this too. don't be fooled by the positive comments; It wasn't scary. It wasn't funny. It wasn't clever. It won't even hold your attention. I just wasted 2 hours of my life viewing this crap-fest. the computer generated monster was interesting to see the first couple times. after about 15 minutes it no longer entertained. the dialogue was terrible	 must be a translation thing. another negative that stood out was the idiot Americans. 3 were portrayed and they were all lacking character	 intelligence and judgment. Now I will write a couple of lines to pad this since we have to have 10. The employees at the video store should have slapped me for bringing this title to the counter."	0.0
"Reese Witherspoon plays Dani	 a young country girl that falls madly in love with the new 17 year old neighbor	 Court	 played by Jason London. Court tries his best to make Dani realize that the difference in their ages would make a love relationship improbable. Soon the nubile charm of Dani starts winning over Court's will. Next enters the meeting of Dani's older sister	 played by Emily Warfield	 and the beginning of a short lived love/jealousy problem.<br /><br />Tess Harper and Sam Waterston round out the cast. This is a fresh	 free spirited; but heartbreaking drama that touches down deep. Feel free to cry."	1.0
"I guess this goes to prove that Joe Don Baker will do anything for a buck. The concept of the film wasn't very good to start with. This movie has so many bad things about it I don't know where to start. The acting is horrible. The cinematography is marginal at best. The soundtrack was pretty bad. The score is terrible. There's a reason why this movie ended up on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before I wrote this and I cannot believe that 9 people actually thought this ""film"" is excellent. They must have liked the two go-go dancers. Final justice would be if they locked this stinker in the film vault outside Wichita and never let anyone see it again! A 1 out of 10 rating is far better than this deserves."	0.0
"I saw this at the theater in the early 1970's. The most memorable and scary scene is when the German army attacks with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time. The Germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hoof) with eerie protective suits. The experienced British soldiers don gas masks (only) and once again await the clouds of gas and the German attackers. The gas clouds move ever closer	 finally enveloping the British defenders. The Germans move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb. Suddenly a scream from the defenders... This gas is like no other that they have experienced before.... <br /><br />Now you will know why I have remembered this scene for the last 30+ years and still shiver	 I think that you will too!"	1.0
"A fashion designer trips over a cat and falls into a pool	 hitting her head on something floating on the surface. With rather cheesy effects (this was a TV movie) she floats up out of her body. She floats through a tunnel of rings of swirling orange smoke	 and black rigid figures tip into her view (they look like the mannequins in her apartment). I almost thought I was watching a Jess Franco movie.... As her friends revive her	 a black arm grabs her by the wrist	 and she has to struggle to get loose. When she is revived	 she remembers everything	 and has a nasty bruise on her forearm.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter	 she nearly gets hit by an out-of-control car that comes up on the sidewalk behind her. On Halloween	 she decides with her boyfriend to go to Mexico for a vacation. When she gets there	 she's surprised to find it's the Day of the Dead. They're annoyed by another American tourist who keeps following them	 and he almost drowns them.<br /><br />The designer is encouraged to join a group of people who've had near death experiences. They've all experienced the tunnel	 but not the black figures or the repeated near escapes from death. One of them has	 and he's very anxious. She's also encouraged to meet with a psychic.<br /><br />A Doctor tells her about people he calls ""Walkers"" (the name of the novel this was based on). They're people who supposedly died of one cause that	 when examined	 prove to have died of another cause. Thus it's like they continued walking around after dying until they died again	 but he blames it on poor record-keeping.<br /><br />I watched this on the 102 minute video	 and it felt awfully long. I can't imagine that there's actually a 192 minute version! Perhaps if it was meant to be watched over two or more nights on TV it would better be watched that way than in one sitting.<br /><br />I've only read one Gary Brandner novel	 Floater	 and if it is representative of his work	 he's not the most original of writers. Floater had the common plot of: picked on kid kills people in revenge. Even the variation was pretty common: picked on kid dies and kills people years later in revenge from beyond the grave. And in fact it has a point in common with this movie	 in that the kid practices astral projection	 and when he is drowned he floats up out of his body as here. I don't know how closely From the Dead of Night follows his novel Walkers. I understand the Howling movies don't bear much resemblance to his novels.<br /><br />It's quite a slow movie	 and the special effects and cinematography are really held down by the (presumably) low budget and made-for-TV shortcomings. There are a lot of easily recognizable character actors in it. It also feels very dated	 more early to mid 1980s than 1989. I found it to be boring. A much better low-budget movie covering similar subject matter that I don't think has dated as badly is Sole Survivor (1983) (arguably the inspiration for the 2000s Final Destination movies). It blows From the Dead of Night away."	0.0
"I am wanting to make a ""Holmes with Doors"" pun but I can't quite string it all together. Suitably grubby and over edited WONDERLAND gives Kilmer a role that channels Morrison at the same time....but how coy is this film about the famous 14 inches! Australian crime films flash it all the time and skip the graphic violence instead.....as someone famous said once about US cinema double standards: ""kiss a breast and it's an X	 stab it and its an action PG 13""... WONDERLAND is 14 minutes too long too	 and at the end the tawdry spiral we were all glad to escape the cinema. How many films called WONDERLAND are we going to get? There must be six in the last decade. The pixilated violence and muted color sets the seedy tone but the wobble-cam gets tiresome	 as if we are gawking at their nostrils all the time. Taking a few cues form THE DOORS and TAXI DRIVER it all becomes forgettable the next day."	0.0
"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he couldn't deliver his lines. The plot was definitely not worthy of John Grisham's name. No wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters. I didn't even watch the whole thing. I decided I didn't care who done it	 then realized there was no ""whodunit"" to care about!"	0.0

"The mind boggles at exactly what about Universal Soldier merited a sequel. Since the real star	 Dolph Lundgren	 would not be able to reprise his role from the original	 there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write-off. Bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler Bill Goldberg and martial arts expert Michael Jai White. To their credit	 they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement. Bill Goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film	 and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role. For once	 his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times	 and it does not get irritating. The problem from the audience's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes Lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films. And therein lies the problem. You do not go to see a Van Damme film because you want serious action. You go because you want comedy	 however unintentional.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to many people	 Universal Soldier was followed by two direct-to-video sequels. I have only seen the first	 which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke. Matt Battaglia was so terrible in the role of Luc Deveraux that for once in his career	 the sight of Jean-Claude Van Damme comes as a welcome relief. The film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct-to-video sequels	 and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original. After years of investigation and explanation	 the Unisol project is still going ahead	 with some minor modifications. For one	 the new Unisols are stronger and more damage-resistant than their earlier cousins. For another	 all of the Unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called SETH. In the early parts of the film	 SETH exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome.<br /><br />Being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes	 we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut. The Unisol project is on the chopping block	 which essentially means that SETH will be turned off. SETH	 somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained	 decides to mobilise the Unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down. His only problem is that every so often	 a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown. Two individuals possess the code in question. SETH kills the first in short order	 and those who are familiar with the plot kit that Van Damme's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be. The rest of the film revolves around the Unisols' attempts to get the code out of Van Damme without injuring him too badly. A subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film	 but it adds about as much to the story as Van Damme does to the profession of acting.<br /><br />The film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichés. When SETH transplants his command module into the body of Michael Jai White	 we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over. He goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity's weakness(es). Gee	 SETH	 you mean they will not be our strong points? All kidding aside	 the short length of the film is both the film's weakness and its strength. It leaves the action without adequate setup. In the original	 we are given a very thorough explanation of the Unisols	 how they work	 and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film. Here	 the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a Unisol is and how they operate. At least in the original	 a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice. Here	 one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform (and presumably his body)	 getting up every time without stopping for breath.<br /><br />I tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner. If you can see it on the cheap	 knock yourself out. This is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of Mystery Science Theatre."	0.0
"First and foremost	 speaking as no fan of the genre	 ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is a breathtaking	 virtuoso	 superb action movie.<br /><br />Secondly	 it is a silly malarky of cartoonish super-hero stuff.<br /><br />Thirdly	 the film carries a complex	 important point	 about crime-fighters turning into criminals themselves. No reference is made to Abu Ghraib or the Executive Branch's outrageous domestic assaults on constitutional rights	 none is necessary.<br /><br />So	 the latest in the ""Bourne"" series	 in the hands of Paul Greengrass (of the 2004 ""Bourne Supremacy"" and last year's ""United 93"")	 is a significant achievement	 perhaps held back but not actually diminished by the unavoidable excesses of the genre.<br /><br />""Breathtaking"" above is meant both as a complimentary adjective and a description of the physical sensation: for more than an hour from the first frame	 the viewer seemingly holds his breath	 pushed back against the chair by the force of relentless	 globe-trotting	 utterly suspenseful action. There is no letup	 no variation in the rhythm and pull of the film	 and yet it never becomes monotonous and tiresome the way some kindred music videos do after just a couple of minutes.<br /><br />Oliver Wood's in-your-face cinematography is making the best of Tony Gilroy's screenplay from Robert Ludlum's 1990 novel (which doesn't stack up well against the ""Bourne Identity	"" written a decade earlier).<br /><br />Matt Damon is once again the inevitable	 irreplaceable Bourne	 the deadliest of fantasy CIA agents	 this time taking on the entire agency in search of his identity	 his past	 and the mysterious agency program that has turned him into a killing machine. Nothing like his quietly heroic Edward R. Murrow	 the always-marvelous David Strathairn is the nasty top agency official	 pitched against Bourne in trying to hide some illegal ""take-no-prisoners"" policies and brutal procedures.<br /><br />Joan Allen plays what appears to be the Good Cop against Strathairn's Bad One. And	 there is Julia Stiles as the agent once again coming to Bourne's aid; a combination of Greengrass' direction and Stiles acting results in a surprising impact by a mostly silent character	 her lack of communication and blank expression more intriguing than miles of dialogue.<br /><br />So good is ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" that it gets away with the old one-man-against-the-world bit	 this time stretched to ridiculous excesses	 as Bourne defies constraints of geography	 time	 gravity... and physics in general. (Can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building? Why not - it looks great.) <br /><br />All this ""real-world"" magic - leaping from country to country in seconds	 to arrive at some unknown location exactly as	 when	 and how needed - outdoes special-effect and superhero cartoon improbabilities. And yet	 only a clueless pedant would allow ""facts"" interfere with the entertainment-based ecstasy of the Bourne fantasy."	1.0
"In director Eric Stanze's 'ISOYC	 IPOYG'	 three men are subjected to torture at the the hands of a woman that they have all sexually abused. The first victim is forced to eat his own crap	 before being axed to death. The next bloke ends up with a bullet in the crotch after refusing to have anal sex with the first guy's corpse. But it's the third man who gets it the worst: he has to watch the heavily tattooed 'star' Emily Haack get naked and masturbate with a broom handle (oh	 he also gets the handle shoved up his butt too!).<br /><br />And	 unfortunately	 so do we (get to see her masturbate	 that isnot get a broom handle up our butts!).<br /><br />Yes	 'ISOYC	 IPOYG' is one harsh viewing experience	 not because of its relentless violence	 but because Haack	 who is obviously under the misguided notion that she has the body of a goddess (as opposed to that of a roadie for Metallica) constantly gets buck naked for the camera. It ain't a pretty sight.<br /><br />In addition to the non-stop nudity from an inked-up Haack	 viewers also get to see dreadful direction from Stanze (who thinks that endless shots of tombstones and trees is entertaining stuff)	 some really bad acting	 and a fat guy's penis.<br /><br />Strangely enough	 I give 'ISOYC	 IPOYG' a rating of 3/10	 which is actually slightly higher than its current 2.9 average. That's one point for the messy axe attack (which	 being a gore-hound	 I actually enjoyed); one point for the bit where the fat guy gets his face pushed in chocolate mousse masquerading as feces (hilarious); and one point for the sheer nerve to suggest that this film might somehow be a sequel to Meir Zarchi's superior exploitation classic I Spit On Your Grave."	0.0
"Flavia the Heretic is an undeniable work of art and probably my number one recommendation to state that the euro-exploitation cinema is severely underrated and not to be ignored. This is an intelligent and complex film	 beautifully realized and  surprise  pretty damn accurate! This is more than just meaningless sleaze or gratuitous violence and it's about time those prudish film committees who categorize Flavia as forbidden trash reckon this as well. Flavia is a beautiful 14th century adolescent	 forced to live the life of an obedient nun in a strict convent. She refuses to accept her being inferior just because she's female and she curses her fellow sister for being so tolerant about this. After a fruitless attempt to escape	 she befriends another rebellious nun and she even guides a troop of bloodthirsty Muslims into the walls of the convent.<br /><br />Flavia is a downright mesmerizing film! Almost impossible to believe that director Gianfranco Mingozzi managed to make it appear so realistic and so disturbing. I challenge you to come up with a title that centers on the topic of pioneer-feminism more intensely than Flavia does. Several sequences are quite shocking (on the verge of nightmarish	 actually) as the camera zooms in on brutal rapes	 torture and mutilation. Yet all this raw footage isn't just used to satisfy perverted gorehounds	 mind you. I'm strongly convinced that they're part of the statement 'Flavia' is trying to communicate: Humanity (the Catholic Church in particular) historically proved itself to be a hypocrite and discriminating race and there's no use in denying it any further. Films like ""Flavia	 the Heretic"" have the courage to question and openly condemn our precious ancestors and I truly admire them for it. Flavia is an outstanding and fundamental exploitation film because of its substance	 but it's even brought to an higher level by the wondrous cinematography	 the glorious costumes & scenery and a breathtaking musical score by Nicola Piovani. Florinda Bolkin is very convincing as the ambitious and headstrong nun but it's María Casares who steals the show as Sister Agatha. She's a man-hating and loud-mouthed nun who likes to urinate in the open field! Amen	 sister!"	1.0
"Never viewed this film until recently on TCM and found this story concerning Poland and a small town which had to suffer with the Nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other European Cities for example: Norway. The First World War was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which War always creates. Alexander Knox	 ( Wilhelm Gimm)""Gorky Park"" returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town. He was brought up a German and was not very happy with the Polish people and they in turn did not fully accept him either. As the Hitler party grew to power Wilhelm Grimm desired to become a Nazi in order to return and punish this small Polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind. Marsha Hunt	(Marja Pacierkowski)	""Chloe's Prayer""	 played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with Whilhelm Gimm. There are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the Nazi destroyed people's families and their entire lives. The cattle cars are shown in this picture with Jewish people heading to the Nazi gas chambers. If you have not seen this film	 and like this subject matter	 give it some of your time; this film is very down to earth for a 1944 film and a story you will not forget too quickly."	1.0
"I will probably always go to see a Woody Alleb movie	 as one never knows when he just might make a real return to his past greatness. Just one or two great moments or lines could make it worthwhile. sadly however this film just does'nt make it on any score. Saying thar actually makes me sad and even a little guilty. I'm sure my reaction is much like a lot of other fans of Woody	 but what can one say? It's probably time for him to concentrate on his Clarinett	 which in my opinion	 he is rather quite good. Saying all of this	 I'll still probably go to any new film Woody may come out with in the future. There's always hope and I'll continue to love and respect The WOODY!!"	0.0
"One of the things that interested me most about this film is the way the characters and their associated histories are developed on the fly. I suppose the writers wanted us to gain interest in the characters by not force feeding their characters. The premise of using the art and craft of furniture design and construction was a unique theme and/or analogy for what families/siblings go through in life. The complexity of having a twin serve as a surrogate father and even husband added great tension towards making this film emotionally interesting. Also	 although the story was not one that the masses might directly relate to (i.e. Jewish/twins/family business) the themes are fairly universal as every family has a black sheep in it. That made it very engaging."	1.0
"If Jean Renoir's first film ""Whirlpool of Fate"" first takes us into the world of the countryside	 the rivers	 the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore	 it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged	 the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards. Put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great ""Grand Illusion"" and ""Rules of the Game."" This is beautifully filmed	 with the restless camera making full use of the amazingly huge apartments and backstage areas that dominate the film's interiors	 and the acting though frequently overwrought offers some great moments as well	 particularly from Werner Krauss' Muffat. But the glamorous and sultry Ms. Hessling	 who at first appears as if she might give Louise Brooks a run for her money in vampishness	 never goes beyond a one note	 selfish harlot portrayal. Perhaps this is in part a problem with the script	 which does seem to mostly go for high points and outraged emotions; not having read the novel I'm not really clear on whether the choices were well-made or not.<br /><br />Still	 the differences between Nana's suitors are well-drawn	 and I particularly liked the relationship between Muffat and Jean Angelo's Vandeuvres -- the tragic understandings that each seems to have of his ultimate fate and their sympathy with each other	 particularly in the scene at the bottom of the enormous staircase where Vandeuvres warns Muffat	 and we wonder if violence will erupt -- this and other gleanings of the ridiculousness of the idle rich help give the film the depth it has.<br /><br />Far from his greatest achievement	 and for me probably just shy overall of ""Whirlpool of Fate""	 this is still well worth seeing for Renoir fans or those interested in silent cinema generally."	1.0
The Cure uses voice over to create an intense mood. Although the VO accounts for all of the film's lines it amazingly does not take away from the visual story. The use of multiple film stocks add a lot of texture to the story. The choice of combining b & w and color worked nicely to enhance the leaps in time. The ending will make you jump despite being able to anticipate the result. I was especially enjoyed the thrill of the film's suspense. The close-ups for the love scene are also lovely and reflect a tasteful eye. The piece is quite short but accomplishes a lot. The tight editing really helps to show off what a short film can do. Worth watching more than once!	1.0

"Steven Seagal	 Mr. Personality himself	 this time is the United States' greatest Stealth pilot who is promised a pardon from the military(..who attempted to swipe his memory at the beginning of the movie for which he escaped base	 later caught after interrupting a gang of robbers in a shootout at a gas station)if he is able to successfully infiltrate a Northern Afghanistan terrorist base operated by a group called Black Sunday	 who have commandeered an Air Force stealth fighter thanks to an American traitor. Along with a fellow pilot who admired the traitor	 Jannick(Mark Bazeley)	 John Sands(Seagal)will fly into enemy territory	 receiving help from his Arab lover	 Jessica(Ciera Payton)and a freedom fighter	 Rojar(Alki David) once they are on ground. Jannick is kidnapped by Black Sunday leaders	 Stone(Vincenzo Nicoli)and his female enforcer	 Eliana(Katie Jones)	 and Sands must figure out how to not only re-take command of the kidnapped stealth fighter	 but rescue him as well. And	 maybe	 Sands can get revenge on the traitor he trained	 Rather(Steve Toussaint)in the process. Sands has 72 hours until a General's Navy pilots bomb the entire area. On board the stealth	 Black Sunday equipped a biochemical bomb	 hoping to detonate it on the United States.<br /><br />Seagal gets a chance to shoot Afghans when he isn't slicing their throats with knives. The film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead. The setting of Afghanistan doesn't hold up to scrutiny(..nor does how easily Seagal and co. are able to move about the area undetected so easily) and the plot itself is nothing to write home about. The movie is edited fast	 the camera a bit too jerky. Seagal isn't as active a hero as he once was and his action scenes are tightly edited where we have a hard time seeing him taking out his foes	 unlike the good old days. One of Seagal's poorest efforts	 and he's as understated as ever(..not a compliment). Even more disappointing is the fact that Seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the film's chief villains	 tis a shame. He doesn't even snap a wrist or crack a neck in any visible way(..sure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around	 but it's not as clear a picture as I enjoy because the filmmakers have such fast edits and dizzying close-ups)."	0.0
"Bridges of madison county is a better made version of this story. I felt the ending of this movie was not handled sensitively as they did in the original English movie. This movie is very indianised	 if you are a very sensitive person who cries in a movie when hero dies in the end you'll love this movie	 On the other hand if you are a fighter in life and think crying is for wimps you may not like the ending.But on the whole it's pretty good subject is well handled for indian conditions. Tabu was good as a caring wife and mother. Everybody acted well."	0.0
"Yes	 this movie is bad. What's worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title!! In the ENTIRE movie	 zombies and vampires fight each other ONCE OR TWICE. On top of that	 we're never really sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One might argue they were trying to ""tone it down"" or make it ""realistic	"" but it ends up just boring. More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR. The scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to brag about	 either. Also	 there's no clear antagonist	 and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /><br />However	 I will say that for a film this low in production value	 the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere). <br /><br />I'm all for independent films	 but it doesn't look like this was ever intended for a mass audience (if any). <br /><br />""worse than Scarecrow slayer."""	0.0
"Criticism of the film EVENING	 based on the novel by Susan Minot and adapted for the screen by Minot and Michael Cunningham	 has been harsh	 so harsh that it may have discouraged many viewers from giving the film a try. The primary criticism has centered on the fact that very little happens in this film about a dying woman's fretting over a mistake she made one summer in her youth	 that famous actors were given very minor roles	 that the entire production was over-hyped	 etc. For this viewer	 seeing the film on a DVD in the quiet of the home	 a very different reaction occurred.<br /><br />Ann Grant Lord (Vanessa Redgrave) is dying in her home by the ocean and her medication and memories allow her to share a man's name - 'Harris' - with her two grown daughters Nina (Toni Colette) and Constance (Natasha Richardson). As her daughters sit at her bedside Ann relives a particular summer when she was a bridesmaid for her best friend Lila (Mamie Gummer) - a marriage both Ann (Claire Danes as the youthful Ann) and Lila's alcoholic brother Buddy (Hugh Dancy) objected to	 feeling that Lila was simply marrying a man of her class instead of the boy she had loved - Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson)	 her housekeeper's son who had become a physician. Harris	 Buddy	 Lila	 and Ann are woven together in a series of infatuations and romances that have been kept secret until now	 50 years later	 as Ann is dying. The older Lila (Meryl Streep) visits Ann at the end and the secrets are revealed: 'there are no such things as mistakes - life just goes on.' The film is a delicate mood piece and the script by Minot and Cunningham is rich in atmosphere and subtle life lessons. Yes	 there are gaps in the story that could have used more explanation	 but in order to maintain the aura of nostalgia of a dying lady's words	 such 'holes' are understandable. The film is graced by the presence of not only Redgrave	 Richardson (Redgrave's true daughter)	 Collette	 Gummer (Streep's true daughter)	 Meryl Streep	 Claire Danes	 Eileen Atkins	 Glenn Close	 Hugh Dancy and Patrick Wilson	 but also with an ensemble cast of brief but very solid performances. The setting is gorgeous (cinematography by Gyula Pados) and the musical score is by the inimitable Jan A.P. Kaczmarek. Lajos Koltai (""Being Julia') directs. Judge this film on your own....

"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** After two so-so outings (""Magnum Force"" and ""The Enforcer"")	 Dirty Harry seems to have regained his stride in ""Sudden Impact	"" a gripping thriller that wisely plays to its strengths: the charisma of Clint Eastwood	 who also directed	 and a story that spends just enough time on exposition and reserves its energy for the big scenes.<br /><br />For once	 the case takes Harry outside his native San Francisco (where he's again in trouble with his superiors for his ""shoot first	 ask questions later"" tactics)	 to the hamlet of San Paulo. There	 (WARNING: Potential spoiler) a group of lowlifes is being gruesomely murdered	 one at a time	 by a woman whom they gang-raped years earlier	 and whose sister has been in a state of catatonia ever since the attack.<br /><br />The killer is portrayed by Sondra Locke	 and she makes the character of Jennifer Spencer an interesting mix of compassion and cold-bloodedness. Locke's cold eyes and frosty voice	 when either trying to comfort her hospitalized sister or dispensing vengeance toward the rapists	 are very effective in painting a portrait of a woman wronged whose years of suffering and rage are now beginning to bear deadly fruit.<br /><br />The rapists are a despicable lot	 especially the leader	 who has ""psycho nutjob"" practically stamped on his forehead	 and a lesbian who seems almost one of the guys	 despite her anatomical inability to participate. The flashback scenes	 while not graphically explicit	 are nightmarish enough	 and clearly intended to make the audience cheer for Jennifer as she kills her assailants.<br /><br />Some will dismiss ""Sudden Impact"" as trash: a mindless	 manipulative revenge tale. On a certain level this is true	 but it's well-done trash. What works to the movie's advantage is the strength of the Sondra Locke performance	 giving us a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gestures or speech. What we have here is an action movie with a point of view.<br /><br />You can take or leave the idea that some wrongs deserve to be punished by any means necessary	 but as the mystery behind the slayings becomes clear to Harry (a realization that	 wisely	 is not spelled out with dialogue)	 he is presented with a choice -- what to do about a killer whose motivations he can sympathize with but whose conduct he is bound by law to not tolerate. This makes the story more interesting than the usual Dirty Harry fare.<br /><br />The movie's other redeeming quality is Eastwood's direction. This is	 after all	 a Dirty Harry movie	 and Eastwood knows the character better than anyone else. The movie is directed with style and wit	 and edited to give the action scenes a big payoff. Some of the best ""Harry moments"" in the entire series are here	 including Harry's best-known line	 ""Go ahead -- make my day.""<br /><br />""Sudden Impact"" is a movie that has the courage of its convictions in presenting a tale about a despicable crime and the brutal consequences that follow. It is also a riveting detective story	 well made and well told. And it is certainly never dull. On those criteria	 it succeeds tremendously."	1.0
"I was given the opportunity to see this 1926 film in a magnificently restored theater that was once part of the extensive Paramount chain of vaudeville houses. This Paramount has a Mighty Wurlitzer' organ  also magnificently restored -- that was used to accompany the silent films of the day.<br /><br />We were fortunate enough to have Dennis James	 a key figure in the international revival of silent films at the Mighty Wurlitzer playing appropriate music and thematic compositions fitting to the action on the film. The print was a nearly perfect digital copy of the rapidly decaying nitrate negative and the entire experience was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see a silent film as it was meant to be seen.<br /><br />This was Greta Garbo's first American film. She was only 20 years old but already had 6 Swedish films in her repertoire.<br /><br />It is somewhat ironic that this is a silent film about an opera star; even though the Mighty Wurlitzer added immensely to the mise-en-scene	 it was necessary to leave much to the imagination.<br /><br />Modern audiences	 for the most part	 do not understand silent films Acting was different then	 with expansive gestures and broad facial expressions. Therefore audiences laugh at inappropriate times  the acting is seen as hammy' and over-done  but it was simply the style of the period.<br /><br />Garbo	 with all her subtlety	 did much to usher in the new age of acting: she could say more with a half-closed eye and volumes could be read into a downward glance or a simple shrug. She exemplifies the truism that `a picture is worth a thousand words.'<br /><br />Even though this is Garbo's first American film it is pretty obvious the studio knew what they had on their hands: This was MGM filmmaking at its best. The sets and costumes were magnificent. The special effects  which by today's standards are pretty feeble  were still electrifying and amazing.<br /><br />The script by Vicente Blasco Ibanez (from the novel by Entre Naranjos) would seem to be tailor made for Garbo; it showcases her strengths	 magnifies her assets and there is no pesky language problem to deal with: a Swedish actress can play a Spanish temptress with no suspension of disbelief on our part.<br /><br />Her co-star was MGM's answer to Rudolph Valentino: Ricardo Cortez. He does an admirable job and did something that few romantic stars of the day ever would have done in a film: allow himself to look unnactractive	 appear foolish and to grow old ungracefully.<br /><br />There are some fairly good character parts that are more than adequately acted  especially when you consider the powerhouse that was Garbo. Notable among them are Lucien Littlefield as Cupido' and Martha Mattox as Doña Bernarda Brull.'<br /><br />This is when the extraordinary cinematographer	 William H. Daniels	 met Garbo  they went on to make 20 films together. (He was the cinematographer on 157 films and his career spanned five decades!) He was able to capture her ethereal beauty and it was his photography that was primarily responsible for the moniker by which she became known: The Divine Garbo. Without his magnificent abilities she would not have been the success that she was.<br /><br />Seeing this film is an all-too-rare opportunity: if you ever have the chance	 do not miss it."	1.0

"A comedy gem. Lots of laugh out loud moments	 the shop and pub scenes had me belly- laughing uncontrollably. The characters are recognisable and the dialogue well-observed - I know people like this! The humour is surprisingly gentle and the film (this may sound strange) puts me in mind of an Ealing Comedy. It's a quirky little film with lots of detail. It certainly takes a number of viewings. I've watched it a few times (I've been showing all my friends!) and notice something new each time - a bit of dialogue	something visual that I hadn't picked up on before. I could get really picky and find a couple of shortcomings in the film but I'm not going to because overall this is a great fun	 feel-good film which is really worth a watch and which anyone with a sense of humour must enjoy. It is a film which will find it's friends and I hope there are a lot of them out there. Oh.... and It has a great soundtrack."	1.0

"There have been several films about Zorro	 some even made in Europe	 e.g. Alain Delon. This role has also been played by outstanding actors	 such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins	 but to me the best of all times has always been Reed Hadley.

The serial also has good performance of various actors of movies B like Ed Cobb	 ex- Tarzan Jim Pierce	 C. Montague Shaw	 eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King	 and a very good performance of Hadley as Zorro.

"I don't know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site!

The guy's completely generic!) and sub-standard writing rendered this tripe barely watchable. Someone pointed out how cute that Maculay Culkin line was. If you read that and thought that was pure comic brilliance (sadly	 it probably was the most INTENTIONALLY funny part of the movie)	 maybe you'll like this movie.

"Friz Freleng's 'Rumours' is an excellent Private Snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panic-inducing rumours during wartime. Produced	 as were all the Snafu shorts	 to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films	 'Rumours' is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan. When Snafu starts a rumour about a bombing	 it escalates into an eventual rumour that America has lost the war. This is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long	 rubbery piece of baloney and several strange	 fictional creatures who come back to haunt Snafu with ever more terrible news about his country's military. 'Rumours' is inventive	 fast paced and funny	 all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured	 ""don't badmouth the military"" message. It stands up as one of the best of the Private Snafu shorts."	1.0
I found Horrorvision almost unwatchable. While only 70 minutes in length I still found myself hitting the fast forward button again and again. The acting was of the `if I scream and say ***k a lot I'm intense' school.

"William H. Macy is at his most sympathetic and compelling here as a hit-man and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents. Treads much of the same territory as TV's ""The Sopranos"" in terms of the mid-life crisis of a criminal theme (here too he visits a shrink) but is still worth watching thanks to some taut direction from Brommel (I look forward to what this guy directs next)	 an excellent script	 and all around great performances. Macy is excellent as always. This is probably his best role since ""Fargo."" Donald Sutherland is at his creepy best as the domineering father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly riveting dramatic turn as Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is excellent as Macy's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines sound ad-libbed and are wonderful). Even Neve Campell (who I usually find abhorrent) is compelling as the troubled young woman who captures Macy's eye. All of this is punctuated by a moving score and crisp pace that lead up to a predictable but still powerful climax and meaningful and touching aftermath. This film deserved a much wider release	 as I suspect it would have connected with audiences."	1.0
"The plot of this terrible film is so convoluted I've put the spoiler warning up because I'm unsure if I'm giving anything away. The audience first sees some man in Jack the Ripper garb murder an old man in an alley a hundred years ago. Then we're up to modern day and a young Australian couple is looking for a house. We're given an unbelievably long tour of this house and the husband sees a figure in an old mirror. Some 105 year old woman lived there. There are also large iron panels covering a wall in the den. An old fashioned straight-razor falls out when they're renovating and the husband keeps it. I guess he becomes possessed by the razor because he starts having weird dreams. Oh yeah	 the couple is unable to have a baby because the husband is firing blanks. <br /><br />Some mold seems to be climbing up the wall after the couple removes the iron panels and the mold has the shape of a person. Late in the story there is a plot about a large cache of money & the husband murders the body guard & a co-worker and steals the money. His wife is suddenly pregnant. <br /><br />What the hell is going on?? Who knows?? NOTHING is explained. Was the 105 year old woman the child of the serial killer? The baby sister? WHY were iron panels put on the wall? How would that keep the serial killer contained in the cellar? Was he locked down there by his family & starved to death or just concealed? WHO is Mr. Hobbs and why is he so desperate to get the iron panels?? He's never seen again. WHY was the serial killer killing people? We only see the one old man murdered. Was there a pattern or motive or something?? WHY does the wife suddenly become pregnant? Is it the demon spawn of the serial killer? Has he managed to infiltrate the husband's semen? And why	 if the husband was able to subdue and murder a huge	 burly security guard	 is he unable to overpower his wife? And just how powerful is the voltage system in Australia that it would knock him across the room simply cutting a light wire? And why does the wife stay in the house? Is she now possessed by the serial killer? Is the baby going to be the killer reincarnated? <br /><br />This movie was such a frustrating experience I wanted to call my PBS station and ask for my money back! The ONLY enjoyable aspect of this story was seeing the husband running around in just his boxer shorts for a lot of the time	 but even that couldn't redeem this muddled	 incoherent mess."	0.0
"The book is so good that at least the opening of this made-for-tv movie will move you	 but then	 as it diverges more and more from the book	 taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches	 it becomes boring. Still	 from comments I've heard	 people who have not read the book tend to like it	 and if it leads even on child to read A Wrinkle in Time	 it will have served its purpose. The most embarrassing change is to make the Happy Medium a clone of Mary Poppins' Uncle Albert (I love to Laugh).

Then one night they are having drinks in a bar	 and they begin to talk. Then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events. The story is excellent	 the acting is top notch	 and the humor is hilarious I never thought that Pierce Brosnan would be this funny	 but he really is and I must say this movie is a must see."	1.0
"German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible: he's unseated fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made.<br /><br />Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium. This film is as shoddy and laughable as the best-worst of EW. I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto	 morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set. The answer is: subterranean; Lommel dug a pit and buried it.<br /><br />The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies. Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles	 where every auto mechanic	 doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered	 could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face.<br /><br />The main character	 a villainous beat cop	 is played by a German actor with a thick German accent. Aside from being a serial killer	 he is also the oldest beat cop in LA. Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody	 then drags them into his home (which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse)	 and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners	 the LAPD refuses to investigate	 going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment.<br /><br />The sets are excruciatingly bad. The production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint ""Precinct 707"" on a cardboard wall.<br /><br />Since the actors were obviously unpaid non-professionals--a sad assortment of European emigres (possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands)	 bimbos	 mimbos	 and desperate middle-aged women--and since little if any money was spent on sets	 special efx	 locations or other production value	 it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine-looking police uniforms. Sadly	 they couldn't afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental.<br /><br />More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him. One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies. The other fits right in	 with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated.<br /><br />The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie	 as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her. Don't ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered	 just accept Lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride.<br /><br />After much prolonged hand-clawing out of straw-covered roadside graves	 the zombie girls manage to make their appearance. They look exactly as they did before death	 maybe even prettier	 with black glamor make-up generously airbrushed around their eyes. Looking nothing like zombies	 they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway.<br /><br />At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll	 and injects large doses of cheesy Euro-trash techno into the soundtrack. We're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise. Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty.<br /><br />Unlike other zombies	 Lommel's girls speak and function as normal... er	 I mean	 as they did before becoming zombified. This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog. Yes	 a golden shower it is.<br /><br />I won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending. All I can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece. The spirit of Ed Wood lives on... or should I say his geist."	0.0
"This show is good. I like the acting	 funny bits and the cuteness of it. The actors	 Lee Pace	 Ann Friel... etc	 they all did great in the show. The show started off great with its funny	 illogical basic idea of bringing dead people back in the first series and honestly	 as what people said	 the first few episodes of the second series were a bit of a let down but it later came back looking good anyway. And now I really hate the fact that it's going to be cancelled. Why doesn't ABC just let it finish until the very end when all the episodes are already done?? I really wanna know how the story's going to be. I think it should be given a chance as there're still so many viewers who love it."	1.0
"Mirage (1990) is a very rare horror/chiller from 1990	 released here in the UK on the ""New World Video"" label.<br /><br />It's a desert based horror film about a group of young friends who are partying for the weekend	 only to be killed off one by one by an unknown force who drives a menacing black truck!!! This film has some creepy scenes	 and some gore here and there	 but i have to say that the acting was so lame	 even by low budget standards! But the film was oddly addictive and i liked it	 and i never fell asleep or turned it off	 which is always a good sign! I nearly gave this movie 6/10	 but seeing as it built up steam along the way	 had some good moments of gore and suspense	 had some good nudity	 and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was a hottie too! i'll give it 7/10."	1.0
"This is a comedy of morals	 so occasionally a gentle touch of bitterness occurs	 but a lightness soften all sarcasm and irony flows till all of a sudden one moment will halt your heart and changes everything.<br /><br />This film	 marvelously written and directed	 is a gem that shines perfectly	 with beautiful acting by all. Jean-Louis Trintignant is exquisite as usual	 and Romy Schneider is a pearl	 perfect and glowing	 that is not to be missed. A truly wonderful film !!"	1.0
"This film was on last week and although at that time of the day (around 6pm) the quality of the movies is almost never good (at least here on Mexican TV)	 I couldn't switch the TV off. The story about Madelene Moore really touches you. She doesn't come across as a very sympathetic character at first	 but seeing the whole film	 you just want her so succeed. This film really leaves you thinking. And i think that basically due to the great acting of Brooke Johnson. I had never heard of her before nor knowingly seen her in another film	 but this was great great acting. Compliments to Brooke. I hope to see her in another film soon."	1.0
"The thing I remember most about this film is that it used to air on local KTLA TV (Ch. 5) during every Christmas season during the mid to late 70s	 mainly due to the fact that the true story took place on or near Christmas Eve. It was always a bit disturbing to see the hell that this girl goes through	 being the lone survivor of a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle. The graphic scene of this young girl pulling leeches out of her infected leg made quite an impression on this young viewer. Not quite the kind of Christmas cheer I was used to seeing at the time. Definitely not a Rankin-Bass production."	1.0
"Connie Hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at times.<br /><br />That's it	 folks. The sole reason for even considering whether to watch this film or not.<br /><br />These 70s sexploitation period pieces are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their very datedness (flared trousers	 big hair	 Zapata moustaches etc.). This one isn't.<br /><br />The script is bad	 the acting is bad	 the direction is bad	 and the idea of having a senior citizen romantic leading man is exceptionally bad.<br /><br />The title	 hinting at a sex comedy	 is grossly misleading.<br /><br />I heartily recommend avoiding this one like the plague."	0.0
"Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) has just been dumped by his wife	 because he is one of the most annoying 	 neurotic people in the world. Suicide is his way out	 but he just can't seem to get it to work	 so he heads over to his friends house. Oscar Madison (Walther Matthau) is also recently divorced and living it up in bachelor heaven. Smoking	 gambling	 hitting on chicks	 eating out and never cleaning is paradise to him. Well	 with the suicide attempts Oscar decides to let Felix move in. At first	 it is a match made in heaven	 Felix cooks and cleans and helps Oscar pay his alimony on time	 but soon Oscar is jonesing for women and Felix (who in today's world would probably be gay) isn't ready to move on. They invite a couple of British birds over and they find Felix so tender that soon they and Felix are weeping and chatting about his family life	 leaving Oscar denied. This is it	 he explodes and throws him out	 but Felix isn't as helpless as it seems	 and soon he has the upper hand. My favorite quote ""You leave me little notes on my pillow. Told you 158 times I can't stand little notes on my pillow. ""We're all out of cornflakes. F.U."" Took me three hours to figure out F.U. was Felix Ungar!"" Based on a Neil Simon play (who also wrote the screenplay)	 this has a certain theatre feel to it. Set and the repartee and looks feel quite play-like (for better or worse). Lemmon and Mathau have excellent comedic chemistry and have appeared in the Grumpier Old Men movies and Out to Sea	 reprising the same finicky/slob roles	 but with different names (to avoid royalty issues	 I'm sure).<br /><br />This movie is like strawberries dipped in chocolate. The chocolate is smooth	 sweet and rich	 the strawberry is tart	 juicy and bright red (unless you get those nasty greenish ones). They are almost polar opposites	 but together	 the contrasts highlight each other and make a wonderful dessert. 7/10 <br /><br />http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies"	1.0
"After seeing all the Jesse James	 Quantrill	 jayhawkers	etc films in the fifties	 it is quite a thrill to see this film with a new perspective by director Ang Lee. The scene of the attack of Lawrence	 Kansas is awesome. The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is outstanding as the bad guy. All the time this film makes you feel the horror of war	 and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they are going to survive the next hours. Definitely worth seeing."	1.0
"Having not seen the previous two in the trilogy of Bourne movies	 I was a little reluctant to watch The Bourne Ultimatum.<br /><br />However it was a very thrilling experience and I didn't have the problem of not understanding what was happening due to not seeing the first two films. Each part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with The Bourne Ultimatum before it had reached the interval! I don't think I have ever watched such an exquisitely made	 and gripping film	 especially an action film. Since I usually shy away from action and thriller type movies	 this was such great news to me. Ultimatum is one of the most enthralling films	 it grabs your attention from the first second till the last minute before the credits roll.<br /><br />Matt Damon was simply fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne. I've heard a lot about his great performances in the Bourne 1+2	 and now	 this fabulous actor has one more to add to his list. I look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future.<br /><br />The stunts were handled with style - each one was done brilliantly and I was just shocked by the impressiveness of this movie. Well done."	1.0
"This movie has a very Broadway feel - the backdrop	 the acting	 the 'noise'- and yet that's all it has. Some 'sense' of a Broadway without the bang. <br /><br />The movie is slow-paced	 the picture disjointed	 the singing 'pops up' on you so that you suddenly are reminded it's a musical. <br /><br />Disappointing: Sinatra <br /><br />Intolerable: Sinatra's fiancé---surely	 the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary. <br /><br />Tolerable: Mr ""i remember the numbers on my dice"" <br /><br />Delight: Brando's understated singing (very biased!)<br /><br />Surprise: how much Jean Simmons looks like Vivien Leigh in her Havana scenes. It's the bone structure! How i would've killed to have seen Miss Leigh in a role challenging Brando again."	0.0
"This fanciful horror flick has Vincent Price playing a mad magician that realizes his vocational talents have been sold to another. He devise ways of avenging all those that have wronged him.

Supporting cast includes Patrick O'Neal	 Mary Murphy	 Eva Gabor and Jay Novello.<br /><br />"	0.0
"I found this movie to be suspenseful almost from the get-go. When Miss Stanwyck starts her narration it's only a few minutes until you realize that trouble is coming. The deserted area	 the lock on the deserted gas station door	 everything sets you up to wait for it...here it comes. At first you think it will be about the little boy	 but all too soon you start holding your breath watching the tide coming in. I found this movie to be really stressful	 even though I had watched it before and was prepared for the denouement. Now a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you have seen it before deserves some sort of special rating	 maybe a white knuckles award?"	1.0
"Antonio Margheriti's ""Danza Macabra""/""Castle of Blood"" is an eerie	atmospheric chiller that succeeds on all fronts.It looks absolutely beautiful in black & white and it has wonderfully creepy Gothic vibe.Alan Foster is an English journalist who pursues an interview with visiting American horror writer Edgar Allan Poe.Poe bets Foster that he can't spend one night in the abandoned mansion of Poe's friend	Thomas Blackwood.Accepting the wager	Foster is locked in the mansion and the horror begins!The film is extremely atmospheric and it scared the hell out of me.The crypt sequence is really eerie and the tension is almost unbearable.Barbara Steele looks incredibly beautiful as sinister specter Elisabeth Blackwood.""Castle of Blood"" is easily one of the best Italian horror movies made in early 60's.A masterpiece!"	1.0
"I'm not a regular viewer of Springer's	 but I do watch his show in glimpses and I think the show is a fine guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time. So naturally	 I'm going to watch this movie expecting to see ""Jerry Springer Uncensored."" First of all	 Jerry appears in approximately twenty minutes of the film's running time. The other hour and twenty minutes is spent building up this pseudo-farce about trailer-trash	 jealousy	 incest and deception. Jaime Pressley (who looks hot as HELLLL) is a trailer-trash slut who sleeps with her stepfather (a very unusual-looking	 chain-smoking	 drunken Michael Dudikoff who finally strays from his action hero persona). The mom finds out about the affair	 they get into a fight	 they want to take it to the ""Jerry"" show (that's right	 no Springer). And then we have a parallel story with an African-American couple. They take it to the ""Jerry"" show. The characters collide. Blah	 blah	 freakin' blah! Trash has rarely been this BORRRINGG!!!! I was wondering why the hell Springer has millions of fans	 yet none of them checked out his movie. Well	 now it's TOTALLY obvious!! Whether you love him or hate him	 you will hate this movie! How can I explain? It's a total mess of a motion picture (if that's what you call it). It's so badly edited	 with scenes that just don't connect	 and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears and it's simply all over the map! Just imagine a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce. With seldom laughs. <br /><br />My only positive note is a hot girl-girl scene. That's as risque as it gets. Don't get me wrong	 the scene's pretty risque	 but if you look at the overall film comparing it to the material on Springer's program--this disastrous farce seems extremely sanitized.<br /><br />My score: 3 (out of 10)"	0.0
"Brokedown Palace is truly a one of a kind. It's an amazing story	 showing two girl's plight for freedom against the Thailand justice system. They soon find themselves placing faith into a system they know nothing about.<br /><br />Alice Morano (Claire Danes) and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale)	 are two best friends	 strait out of high school. They suddenly change their vacation plans from Hawaii to Thailand	 and are immediately captivated by a young man	 Nick Parks. He flirts with them both	 and suggests that the three of them go to Hong Kong for the weekend.<br /><br />When the two arrive at the airport	 they are immediately searched for drugs. Someone tipped off customs	 and in an instant	 their life is changed forever. In the mix of the confusion of settling into their new life	 they learn about a highly respected lawyer	 named Hank Green (Bill Pullman).<br /><br />An American who knows the Thai justice system	 he fights for the girl to be free. But they soon find out	 when they leave or go is all up to them.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great movie that'll stay with you for years - Brokedown Palace is definitely the way to go."	1.0
"The 1998 Michael Keaton kiddie comedy of the same title was roundly condemned for it's	 um	 shoddy special effects	 but compared to what Screaming Mad George cooked up for this horror comedy they're positively mind-boggling. The killer snowman seems to be made out of styrofoam and his arms look like oversized oven mitts. Which they probably were. The cast lays it on thick in this parody of dozens of other (much worse) movies and Paul Keith as the town doctor is particularly memorable in a small but hilarious role."	0.0
"I really have no idea how to comment on this movie. The special effects were lackluster	 the acting was terrible and if there was a plot to it all	 it was on the back of the box. I don't think I can remember a movie being THIS bad in a long time	 and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies!! ;) Even that couldn't save this movie from being just a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand (or lay in this case) in front of a camera.<br /><br />I was pretty much let down by the overall ""zombie"" effect. Since apparently in this movie	 zombies are so commonplace that running over a couple here and there	 and casually talking about it at a gas station (one with an in-house windshield repair but no interior bathroom)	 the zombie-movie genre isn't even a factor until the end. Even then	 a cameo by a dozen zombies ripping off a girl's clothes doesn't really constitute being a zombie movie.<br /><br />On to the vampires: Apparently all the zombies are male and all the vampires are female	 which is OK by me. I'm not sure how vampires are out in the daylight	 or the why/how of a soldier vampire came to be standing in the middle of the road	 still holding his gun with a stake through his heart	 just waiting for the Queen of the Vampires to flick it all the way through. The last segment in the old nunnery made no sense	 and when one hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire ""Do you think we did the right thing?"" by killing the two apparent heroes in the movie	 that about put it over the top.<br /><br />The acting and special effects were at an all-time low also. You could almost see the hoses that the fake blood was pumped out of during the closeup of the zombie who got ran over by the General. Speaking of the General	 where did they find THIS Kenny Rogers look-alike anyways? No idea what he was the General of	 aside of generally confusing and misplaced.<br /><br />All in all	 watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have the strong urge to waste $3. Just my $0.02."	0.0
This could be a 10 if it wasn't for the quite predictable and hollywood-ish scenario. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms its position as one of the leading actors of our time (why not THE leading may I ask) and the rest of the cast stand in a very high level. I personally was impressed with Hugh O' Connor who played Christy Brown as a child. The very first scene I watched him was really strong. Wow.	1.0
"After watching this movie on DVD	 I watched the trailer. The voice-over describes the movie as surreal. Well	 there's surreal	 and there's surreal. <br /><br />There was really only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me	 but frankly	 it was more confusing than surreal. The other unusual imagery	 particularly the lunchroom scene where everybody is on the floor	 were so nonsensical they had no meaning. I don't mind imagery that doesn't mean anything	 but these scenes just seemed irrelevant.<br /><br />My impression is that the director was trying to convey Logan's inner monologue. I don't know what else would explain what was going on. Unfortunately	 nothing I saw gave me any clue what Logan was thinking about	 what his perspective was	 or even his emotional state. All I could tell was that he wasn't particularly happy with his physical appearance	 and that he had a crush on an older boy. <br /><br />I thought the ending signaled what the relationship between the boys had become	 but not much else did. Purposely juxtaposing ambiguous scenes with those that were more straightforward seemed more like a cop out than an artistic decision. <br /><br />Still	 as tiresome and as content-free the movie was for me	 it was a definite change of pace. I very much liked Madagascar Skin	 and I had the feeling this movie aspired to that kind of narrative	 and perhaps even style. It didn't even come close. For me there's no question about it: this movie deserves an A for effort	 but a D for execution."	0.0
"I watched this movie after watching Practical Magic	 and the older film was far superior. I liked the way the lighting	 makeup	 and costumes changed as Gillian changed in the story. Jimmy Stewart's mannerisms didn't do a lot for me in this film	 but I suppose they did serve to highlight the reserve of Gillian's character. I was also struck by Nicky's and Gillian's mannerisms--it was as if the director wanted him to appear effeminate and Gillian to appear masculine. The gestures Nicky makes when he's showing Redlich his powers especially struck me. I've never thought of warlocks as being effeminate	 so it was an interesting way of contrasting those characters."	1.0
"First off	 I had my doubts just looking at the DVD box and reading it saying that it was about of bunch of teens gathering at a lake where they will find do or something. Any movie that has a premise like this has failed miserably	 even as a slasher movie	 except for the first Friday the 13th.<br /><br />I wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times	 but I just kept thinking that it had to get a little better. It didn't. Usually	 I think every movie has something that you can take from it. This has nothing.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor	 and find something constructive to do for 80 minutes. Like	 give yourself papercuts	 or eat dirt."	0.0
"In my opinion	 this is the best stand-up show I have ever seen. I became an instant Eddie fan after seeing Dress to Kill	 but I must say I think this is his best work. I would say	 though	 if you ever get the chance to definitely go see him live. It is worth it!<br /><br />Most of the time after seeing a stand-up routine a couple times	 the jokes start to get old. But I have to say	 I've seen this show SO many times that I literally have the entire thing memorized (which yes	 I realize is kinda sad) but every joke still makes me laugh. This is truly a feel good show.<br /><br />Dress to Kill will never get old for me. I own it and watch it anytime I need a good laugh."	1.0
"Not sure why it doesn't play in Peoria	 apparently	 but this is a very funny	 clever British comedy. It's set at the end of the ""swinging sixties"". Peter Sellars is fantastic as the rich	 forty-something serial womaniser.

But the urbane TV food critic can't stop himself from falling for the dizzy American blond.<br /><br />Humour	 pathos	 great script	 strong performances from the leads and supporting caste.<br /><br />It's a great film	 and the best gag is the very last line.<br /><br />Try it	 you'll like it."	1.0

Still my N1 remains The Shawshank Redemption! And remember that not all things can be put in frames. Because there are things in this world	 that any frame just won't fit."	1.0
"I should put out an alert all over saying that the movie shouldn't be watched. It fails to a fitting tribute in such a magnificent manner that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men. The special effect were horrible	 I hadn't expected the total failure on the part of the director to appreciate military technology. How can a machine gun which normally fires at the rate of 600 rounds per minute fire at 1/10th the speed? How can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes in front of them? How can people survive when there are artillery shells falling as close as 20 feet away? How come the artillery shells fall only on either side of the road and not the road itself?<br /><br />Not only did this disrespect for the weaponry appall me	 it was the cliched situations and the incongruity of the dialogues which had me screaming murder. There were the standard dialogues like Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai	 ise laath mat maro and Pakistan se jyaada musalmaan to Hindustaan me hai and LOC cross mat karo ye mera hukum hai. Stupid to say the least.<br /><br />What Shobha De had written is true. The director worked without a script and it shows. There is no flow to the movie. There is no gradual progression from one battle to another. It is just one gunfight after the next with no connection to the overall scheme of the war. The explanatory scenes are awful. The chief of army staff looks unconvincing. To make matters worse the theatre people had indiscriminately cut footage to fit the four hour long movie into 3 hours."	0.0

"Two adventurous teenagers	 best friends	 take a trip to Thailand for one last experience before separating and going off to college. It seems like a fun time of touring an exotic land	 until they meet an attractive stranger who seduces them into taking a trip to Hong Kong and puts drugs in their luggage. They get nabbed by the local police and find that justice in Asia is very different from justice in the U.S.<br /><br />This is the main story line for ""Brokedown Palace"" and it was a good one. The film does a decent job of portraying the arbitrary and corrupt justice systems of third world nations. Actually	 the portrayal was rather mild	 as the prison conditions are often far worse than depicted. It serves as a reminder that no matter how bad we think our justice system is	 it is pristine by comparison to much of the rest of the world.<br /><br />Unfortunately	 there were too many contrived situations in the film that hampered the story. The whole escape attempt was bogus fantasy. To think that friends would be able to smuggle money for a bribe into the prison in a padded bra	 and not be discovered by the guards who were systematically checking everything brought in from visitors	 assumes that either the guards or the viewers are utter blockheads.<br /><br />The story also fails to bring closure to the nagging question of how the drugs got in Alice's (Claire Danes) backpack. Did she actually agree to transport the drugs? We are left to guess. It was intriguing to be kept guessing about the girls' innocence throughout the film	 but we finish the movie never really knowing if one or both of the girls might be guilty. Except for this considerable flaw	 the ending was excellent and the results unexpected.<br /><br />The acting by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale was very solid and well done. Danes	 who has been oversold and over hyped	 actually arrived as an actor in this film. Though her portrayal was frequently immature (as was her character)	 she improved as the film progressed and the circumstances became more dire. Beckinsale	 in contrast has been flying under the radar her whole brief career and shines as the goody-two-shoes who suddenly finds herself in prison. Her's was the best performance in the film.<br /><br />Bill Pullman was miscast as the lawyer. His wry and diffident style is an asset in films like ""While You Were Sleeping""	 but as a lawyer in a third world country on a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice	 he had the wrong personality.<br /><br />The tourist's look at Thailand was interesting	 but it didn't make me want to go there.<br /><br />Overall	 an entertaining film made implausible in parts by the insertion of some ridiculous scenes. I gave it a 7/10."	1.0
"I wish more movies were two hours long. On the other hand	 I wish more American Civil War movies were MERELY two hours long. ""Gone with the Wind""	 ""Gettysburg"" - that's about the length I've come to expect; although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted; and even ""Gettysburg"" lasted as long as it did because things HAPPENED in the course of it.<br /><br />By contrast Ang Lee's film is bloated and uneventful. It actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours. That wasn't a compliment. It's really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation: at the time it feels as though it will never end	 afterwards it seems to have taken no time at all.<br /><br />The film gets off on the wrong foot	 as Lee plays his interminable credits OVER the opening footage (bad mistake) in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe. The central two are Jake	 the son of German immigrants who are staunch supporters of Lincoln	 and Jack	 an equally staunch Southerner whose values Jake shares. (I had to re-read that sentence to make sure I hadn't written ""Jack"" instead of ""Jake"" at some point or vice versa.) The two go off to become ""bushwhackers"" - Southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they can't even be bothered to join the official Southern army	 which I presume they think is for sissies. I'm afraid Lee lost me right there. It's easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes: if we have some independent reason to like them	 or feel as if we know them in some way	 then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more. Not so here. We aren't properly introduced to Jake for at least an hour; when we are	 it becomes clear he's a gormless pimple of a man	 who isn't a confederate by choice so much as by habit - the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does	 whose psychology is purely immitative. The people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way. I found myself cheering whenever the Northern cavalry appeared on the screen. I thought: good - kill the rebels	 end the damned war	 let me go home.<br /><br />Aggravating this problem is the horrible	 horrible dialogue. Everyone speaks in the same whining Southern accent. I've heard accents from all over the English-speaking world and this is the worst of them all. I don't care if Southerners really did talk like that	 it's simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours. And believe me	 we do listen to it for the full two hours: Lee's picture is a talky one	 largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical	 say-everything-three-times	 folksy drawl. It would help if they talked faster	 but not much. Can't these people find a more efficient language in which to communicate?<br /><br />In short: the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life	 who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech	 who don't bathe often enough	 to whom nothing of interest happens	 despite their being involved in a war. Good points? Jewel was nice to look at	 and so was the scenery. But I have complaints even here. The cinematography	 nicely framed	 looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake; and as for Jewel	 we were teased with her body	 but never actually allowed to gaze upon it	 which I think is the least we were owed."	0.0
"A woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town	 and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo	 both zombie related. But perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too...<br /><br />The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact I must confess	 so bad was it I fast forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that	 believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes	 and there is still tons of filler. You get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups	 plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed	 tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors.<br /><br />As for the title characters	 they barely even have a footnote in the film. Why	 you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! Though	 considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights')	 maybe that's a blessing in disguise.<br /><br />And to top it all off	 it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera-work	 scratches on the print	 flickering lights... I had to rub my eyes when I realised it was made in 2001	 and not 1971. Even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date!<br /><br />If you think I'm not qualified to do a review of Chronicles having not seen the whole film	 then go ahead. YOU try sitting through it	 I betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. It is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it	 and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact	 don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning	 leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned... 0/10<br /><br />P.S What kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?!

A very good wartime movie showing the effects of war on a hometown boy who looses his eyesight on Guadalcanal and must come home and re-adjust himself with the help of family and friends. An excellent cast of actor's helps make this movie very entertaining. Eleanor Parker's role as the girlfriend was worthy of an Oscar nomination. She has such an innocence to her in this movie. Ann Doran role was equally satisfying as was all of her small supporting roles. I especially like the hometown aura of pre-war Phildelphia. The hunting scene is very good. Of course the war scene on Guadalcanal truly showed the horror faced by our soldiers during this epic battle. A well deserving film and one that should not be forgotten	1.0
"I haven't seen the original	 but just wanted to drop a quick note to anyone who happens to scroll down this far: Wicker Man is the worst movie I've seen this year. Maybe even in two years. I wish I could ask the theater for my money back or turn back time to warn myself not to see it.<br /><br />I'll give it two positive nods: The sarcasm of Cage's character at least got some laughs from me and the scenery of the island was beautiful. Sorry	 that's it. Here come the jeers. The movie's plot is only propelled forward because other characters won't give Cage any straight answers--and he puts up with this!!! How this could go on for over an hour of my time(much less days in the movie) is beyond me. <br /><br />Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. You leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library. How anyone could read this script and think	 ""Yes	 people should pay $11 to see this shady outline of what a film should look like"" is beyond me.<br /><br />Do not go see this flick. Or even rent it on DVD."	0.0
Demi Moore's character in the movie was selected for the SEALs because of her looks. That was a bad start and the movie went down from there. The plot was totally unbelievable. The will to make it in a tough military unit is not enough. This movie did not convince me of a woman's physical ability to perform the types of tasks required.<br /><br />Trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone's intelligence. The differences between the sexes are what makes life interesting.	0.0
"Mona the vagabond lives on the fringes of French society	 in a life without meaning	 purpose or direction.<br /><br />I watched this because of all the stellar reviews	 but I'm afraid I must have missed something. The character of Mona has little or no personality while drifting through life being rude to people	 getting high and contributing nothing to anyone's life. She's not interesting or exciting. She's just useless.<br /><br />I've seen and known enough people like that: there is no secret meaning to what they're doing. They are just lazy bums. I wouldn't want Mona anywhere near me	 as she tends to steal anything that isn't nailed down and leave her friends in the lurch. Sure she's enigmatic - because there isn't anything to her. Lots of junkies	 winos and bums I've seen are enigmatic; I wouldn't want to see a film about them either.<br /><br />Possibly there is something there that I totally missed. Otherwise I'm assuming that all the reviews are from people who assume anything done by a French female director is high art."	0.0
"This work is less about Steve Martin's character Davis	 than it is about Kline (Mack) and Glover (Simon)	 and Kline and McDonnell (Claire)	 but the dialog inserted via Davis is pondering	 contemplative	 near-poetic existentialism at its best. He is witty	 intelligent	 and thoughtful in both dialog delivery and content. The writers deserved an Oscar.<br /><br />The performances are easy	 relaxed	 and natural; just what you would expect from ""A List"" actors. Martin contributes the performance which leads into his more recent Shopgirl	 guiding you through life	 love	 and the pursuit of wisdom if not happiness. Kline is the straight - the suit - the conformist of the film	 and as such his performance is crisp and refreshing.<br /><br />This work deals with life in all aspects. It engenders a true emotional investment in its characters	 and leaves you feeling hopeful that Mankind is not doomed	 after all	 no matter WHAT you believe	 deep down.<br /><br />All in all? This is delightful	 with a gritty moment or two	 and easy natural dialog which draws you in	 assisting its audience in gaining a high enjoyment from this work. It's definitely worth your time	 though it may not be every one's top choice as Friday/Saturday night entertainment.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the intelligence this exhibited. It's not typical	 and was an unexpected surprise. Another wonderful surprise was the honesty exhibited herein. The couples and friends hold detailed conversations	 which feel and sound fully honest and (again) natural. I was very impressed with this work	 and will be adding it to the DVD collection soon.<br /><br />It rates a 9.1/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :."	1.0
"I have	 ""Things to Come	"" on D.V.D. and it's very clear compared to my VHS version. The audio is fair	 but can be hard to understand at times. <br /><br />I liked the movie so much that I searched for a copy of the book and found it.It gave details of why some things happened. The best things about the movie are the small things that I didn't notice at first. Such as	 John Cabal playing with a toy airplane at a Christmass party	 like it was a dive bomber	 out dateing sea power by naming a battleship	""Dinosuar."" Ships sunk by air-power	 an undeclared enemy sneak attack by airplanes. Swept flying wing planes. Strong rolls for the women through the entire movie. <br /><br />There are more	 see the movie to enjoy them."	1.0
This movie was just plain bad. Just about every cop movie cliché is present and accounted for. Bad guy gets away? check. Partner? check. Wacky personality clash with partner? check. Rookie with something to prove? check. Rookie shows up grizzled veteran. check. About the only ones it didn't touch on were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and retirony but I guess they're saving those old chestnuts for Dooley's next outing. Add in the battle of the sexes with Girl Power along with tired old sight gags and banal overdone material like Dooley's prize car getting trashed all the time and you have the recipe for one really bad movie. Avoid this one at all costs.	0.0
"This	 like Murder She Wrote	 is one of those shows	 that after a stressful day at school	 I sit down in front of the TV	 and watch. Why? Because I genuinely enjoy it	 and it's a shame it's not on the air anymore. Dick Van Dyke is amazing as Dr Mark Sloan	 a doctor-turned-detective	 who with his son	 solves murders. He is joined by a largely unknown but very competent supporting cast	 namely his real-life son	 Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good	 but I noticed that every series her hairstyle changes. i also liked Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter	 but I particularly loved Michael Tucci as Norman	 and was puzzled how he suddenly disappeared. This show is so entertaining	with great guest stars	 it's a bit obvious at times	 like Colombo	 but in every episode	 there is always something to chuckle about. In conclusion	 a great series	 with two thumbs up and a 10/10. Bethany Cox"	1.0
"My girlfriend and I were stunned by how bad this film was. After 15 minutes we would have called it quits except we were too curious to see if the film could possibly redeem itself. It didn't.<br /><br />I can't understand the praise given to this film. The writing was downright awful and delivered by some of the worst acting I have seen in a very long time.<br /><br />One thing that especially annoyed me about this film was that often when people were talking to each other there was an unnatural pause between lines. I understand using a pause to create a feeling of awkwardness (like in Happiness). This was not that type of pause -- it was just simply bad directing. This film might actually be much better with subtitles	 and maybe the overseas market is the best one for this film	 because then the innane dialogue and bad acting wouldn't be noticed as much.<br /><br />I generally like these types of small quirky films (The Real Blonde	 Walking and Talking	 Lovely and Amazing)	 but this one failed on so many levels that I consider it one of the very worst films I have sat through in the last few years."	0.0
"What a disappointment! Piper Perabo is adorable	 Tyra Banks is beautiful but pitiful as an actor and the talented and beautiful Maria Bello is wasted!

"Actually	 they don't	 but they certainly did when trying to think of a singular line that adequately summarises how terrible this entry in the series really is. There were some moments that could have been good	 but they are mostly outweighed by their own conversion into missed opportunities	 and don't get me started on the bad.<br /><br />The wasted opportunities are pretty obvious	 but I will recap them here in case anyone cares. Anyone who hasn't seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point. The first	 and potentially the biggest	 wasted opportunity	 was the plot with Freddy's long-lost child. Now	 the extreme mental illness that Freddy appears to suffer (and I might hasten to add that less than one percent of mental patients are a threat to other people	 leave alone to this extent) is HEREDITARY	 so why not a mystery-type slasher in which Lisa Zane's character dreams of Freddy murdering the teens	 only we later discover it's actually her doing all the killing? Sound like a good plot idea to you? Obviously it was above the heads of Talalay and De Luca.<br /><br />Then there's the trip to Springfield	 where the entire adolescent population has been wiped out	 and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass psychosis. Funnily enough	 said mass psychosis was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner	 although this has a fair amount to do with the fact that we are never shown too much. We are just given quick visual hints of the massive loss of connection with reality that would stem from the grief of every youngster in town dying for reasons beyond one's comprehension and control. The essential problem with this plot element	 however	 is that the town is abandoned too quickly	 and with no real answers. This collection of scenes would have been far creepier with ten minutes of say... one sane citizen explaining to these visitors why the Springfield fair looks like a horror show.<br /><br />Of course	 horror films are never noted for their character development	 unless they're the kind of horror films John Carpenter used to direct	 but how are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die? At least Wes Craven took the time to set up his characters in the original	 and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in. That	 in a nutshell	 is probably the biggest problem with Freddy's Dead: it just doesn't try at all	 leave alone hard enough.<br /><br />On a related note	 I feel kind of sorry for Robert Englund	 now that he is more or less inextricably linked with the Freddy character. He has played far better characters in far better productions (the science-fiction miniseries ""V""	 for example)	 and to be forever remembered as ""the man who played Freddy"" is selling him rather short. It seems he will never break the mold of horror films now. As for the rest of the cast	 well	 I think their performances here speak for themselves. They deserved to be permanently typecast as little more than B-grade horror props. Even Yaphet Kotto doesn't escape this one unscathed	 as his character is one of the most childishly written in the history of B-films.<br /><br />All in all	 Freddy's Dead gets a 1 out of me. I'd vote lower	 but the IMDb doesn't allow for that. FD is really a testament to how a writer's inability to exploit a concept to the fullest extent can ruin not only a film	 but an entire franchise."	0.0
"This film is terrible. You don't really need to read this review further. If you are planning on watching it	 suffice to say - don't (unless you are studying how not to make a good movie).<br /><br />The acting is horrendous... serious amateur hour. Throughout the movie I thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like Michael Madsen	 only to find out that it is actually him! A new low even for him!!<br /><br />The plot is terrible. People who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before. Even by the standard of Hollywood action flicks	 this is a terrible movie.<br /><br />Don't watch it!!! Go for a jog instead - at least you won't feel like killing yourself."	0.0
"I really hope that Concorde/New Horizons wasn't trying to make a serious horror	 or even action movie when they made Carnosaur 3. The movie is flat-out silly from start to finish.

"I saw this on a flight over to the U.S and was a little sceptical at first as a few people had said there were so many characters in it that you didnt get to know any of them. However I didnt find this at all. The film is fast	 but this is due to the nature of the director and the star. The chase scenes are excellent and yes it may be predictable but isnt that true of most films. The main villain is a bit of a let down	 Christopher Eccelston is not as convincing as he could have been	 but that said its still a good film."	1.0
"The comparison is perhaps unfair	 but inevitable. Those attracted to the intimacy and depth of Umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a cut-and-paste musical in the American style - awkward	 stilted dialogue with inexplicable song-and-dance numbers. Gene Kelly's French accent was apparently so poor	 that a dreadful job of dubbing was substituted (as you'll remember	 the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in Umbrellas). The translation of the French (for subtitled versions)	 as well	 leaves something to be desired	 although this can't be attributed to Demy. The film also has several self-aware moments that come off a wee disconcerting	 such as references in songs to LeGrand himself. And the costumes - well	 the tight pants/white boots combination	 and the freakishly unnatural colors	 reminds one of an Austin Powers film . . .<br /><br />But Demy does reward the viewer with allusions to Umbrellas; note	 for instance	 the suitcase carried by Maxence in his departure from Rochefort - this is the same suitcase carried by Guy in his departure from Cherbourg. Also	 note the ""Convenient Brunette of Resolution"" - Madeleine in Umbrellas	 and Josette in Young Girls.<br /><br />Generally speaking	 those expecting the natural feel of Umbrellas (save the floating bicycle scene)	 or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in Umbrella's script	 should probably pass this one b y. Those looking for a French version of a thin '60s American musical will be quite happy."	0.0
"I bought this movie for $5 at a used CD store	 and I kinda regret it. I'll start by saying I'm a huge fan of cheesy horror flicks. They provide a horribly tacky cheap entertainment. This movie entertained for the first half hour	 because it was so bad it could be made fun of in an MST3K style manner quite easily. Then it got boring.<br /><br />The acting is the scariest part of the movie. While great acting is not to be expected	 this was laughably bad and	 honestly	 provided all of the entertainment that was to be had. This is the plus side to the movie. Where the movie really falters in entertaining is the writing	 lighting	 and the editing.<br /><br />This movie provides way too many ""What the %$@# is going on?"" moments. There are many moments	 such as the mother having strange fits at dinner	 and then that having absolutely no consequence in the movie. Along the lines of dinner	 someone in charge decided it was fun to watch people eat refined food for five minutes straight without dialogue every time a meal was served. During the meals and other inappropriate moments	 the scene cuts away to pure darkness outside. Then cuts back in. And speaking of darkness outside	 one of the funniest parts of the movie is the climate	 where apparently it isn't nighttime unless it's raining. And speaking of darkness	 a big problem with the movie is that it's so poorly lit you can't see what's going on half the time	 which is more of a frustration than anything. In one of the climactic scenes	 you can't even tell what you're supposed to be seeing that's so shocking.<br /><br />And when it comes to climactic scenes	 Unhinged contains one of the worst. I've seen people say ""Wow	 that surprised me	 and that's good."" I can say that the big reveal did surprise me	 because I didn't see it coming. The reason I didn't see it coming is because it made absolutely no sense. I won't ruin it for you	 but I will tell you that my friend and I spent a good twenty minutes rewinding to various parts of the movie to find anything that would have validated that at all	 and all we found were more things saying that it wasn't possible.<br /><br />All in all	 this movie is actually better when you watch it with the commentary tracks that make fun of it. I love crap horror movies	 but this was too much."	0.0
"This movie is not as horrible as most Sci-Fi Channel movies. I am used to seeing the gray CGI blobs and the amateurish special effects such as close-ups of fake blood that make it very obvious that the blood is strawberry syrup or some other syrup variation. However	 I had thought that I had seen all the possible lows that the Sci-Fi Channel could hit. Then I saw this movie.<br /><br />Imagine a hand inside a rubberized sock that is glazed with syrup? Those are the main Alien Vampires in this movie. You can clearly see the fingers inside the rubbery sock puppets. A talking hand comes out of the guts of victims	 and the Vampire who is on the Vampire Hunter's team can talk to these Rubber Sock puppets in Transylvanian. How did Alien Vampires learn Transylvanian? And isn't Transylvania in Romania? So shouldn't they be talking Romanian? Why would some little town have their own language? If you can suspend your gag reflex and get past the talking rubber socks with the fingers clearly moving inside the Aliens' heads; then you have to deal with the other alien vampires. There are the ""Leatherfaces"" who like to wear the faces of their victims. Then there are the just plain ugly ones that all seem to have a lot of facial scars. Then there are the annoying Valley Girls and their boyfriends who are human traitors and sneak into space colonies so that they can sabotage the Defense Systems so that these Space Vampires can attack.<br /><br />Finally	 if you think all of the above is funny and worth a laugh	 you have to deal with the third rate cast of Network TV rejects that make up this team of stereotypical angry heroes which are constantly fighting among themselves. Why does almost every Sci-Fi Channel movie have to use lead characters that are annoying	 abrasive	 crude	 or just totally unsympathetic? I found myself hoping the talking rubber socks would win."	0.0
"This project was originally conceived as the movie version of popular Japanese manga SlamDunk! and that's not something new to Jay Chou	 who made his movie debut playing a character from another wildly popular manga Initial D. Along the way	 it was decided to incorporate some kung fu into the movie	 so hence the title	 even if the idea wasn't very original	 with Stephen Chow's Shaolin Soccer coming to mind with martial arts and ball games combined.<br /><br />However	 and thankfully	 those scenes where kung fu actually influenced the games were kept to a bare minimum	 and in Kung Fu Dunk	 really quite unnecessary	 because they don't add much to the plot nor drum up much excitement	 and at most offered some cheap laughs and reminisced about the time when Stephen Chow used kung fu in football games. Jay Chou is comfortable in his role as a martial artist Fang Shi-jie since it's not the first time he fought using martial arts (Curse of the Golden Flower anyone?)	 and under the stunt direction of Ching Siu-Tung	 he was made to look really believable as he trashes countless of gangsters in a bar as seen in the trailer	 just to let you know who's boss.<br /><br />That was almost why his character is made a kung fu practitioner	 and for the fact of giving him an excuse for being a top shot	 able to shoot the hoops from practically any angle. And with Eric Tsang as a small time hustler Chen-Li who sees his potential and becomes his agent	 he joins a university to play varsity basketball	 but not without the initial objection of team captain Ting-wei (Chen Bo-Lin) and team star Xiao-lan (Baron Chen	 in his big-screen debut). But you know with team members on the same side	 it's not before long they combine their strengths to take on adversaries on the basketball court.<br /><br />And I will stick my neck out to say that this movie is to basketball just as how Goal was to football. It made the sport look good because of its charismatic characters	 despite them dripping so much coolness and aloofness on the courts. Here	 special effects and wire-work were employed to make the actors seem like professionals who can take out a top side in the NBA league	 and in all honesty	 really looked stunning	 especially when they mimic various dunking moves	 and performing combo-moves thanks to technology and stunt work. So in actuality	 the kung fu elements don't really have to be in the movie. The stunt work itself will be able to justify most of the moves as they're quite grounded to reality	 only having you to suspend belief that boys of average height have springs in their feet to leap that height for a professional dunk.<br /><br />Pity too that the number of games were only a handful	 with the time spent on plenty of subplots	 but each were loosely developed and flitted in and out of the story as and when they please. Things like the abandoned Shi-jie's quest to use the basketball games to get his parents to one day attend them	 that of gangsterism penetrating and influencing games	 and his love life with Charlene Choi in yet another flower vase role just to look good and do nothing else. Everyone's acting a little too cool	 leaving little room for main characters to add depth. One of the key themes here is the realization of the importance of teamwork rather than on individual talent and ability	 and it could have been brought out much stronger if the players themselves interacted a lot more off the court	 than only on it	 and during competitive games	 apart from the high-fives and friendly passes.<br /><br />With the US$10 million budget	 it is easy to see where the money went to - the effects	 in particular	 a massive fantasy sequence at a crucial point in the movie. It's quite flawless	 nice to look at and probably justifiable on its quality alone	 but again I like to emphasize	 that even without those elements	 the basketball stunts itself would still make this a decent movie with nifty basketball moves. And having Jay Chou playing for your team is a big boost to any hopes of a box office success."	1.0
"This is a very funny Ealing comedy about a community in central London who	 through an unusual set of circumstances	 discover they are not English	 but are an annex of the French province of Burgundy.<br /><br />The film features comic actor Stanley Holloway (best known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY)	 as well as a host of other classic comic actors of the period.<br /><br />The story was apparently based on a news item at the time	 when the Canadian Government ""officially"" gave a hotel room to a visiting European member of royalty. The idea actually reminded me of the real-life case of the Hutt River Province in Western Australia	 where a landowner ""seceded"" from the Australian Government due to a wool quota dispute. (It was never acknowledged by the Western Australian or Australian Governments).<br /><br />This is a great script that plays with a lot of political and economic issues	 rather like the TV show ""Yes Minister""; as well as being a great little eccentric character piece as well."	1.0
"Hobgoblins... what a concept. Rick Sloan was a master with this film. He had the brilliance to produce a film with actors that couldn't act. On top of that	 he chose to write a script based on some sort of bad acid trip gone serriously wrong. Put it together	 you end up with a film that sucks more than a warehouse filled with suction cups and vaccum cleaners. This movie was very painful.

"Amazing. That's what you'd say if you sat through this film. Simply	 incredibly	 amazing. It's actually so amazing that anyone was stupid enough to dump money into making this monstrosity that you simply can't believe what you're seeing. That	 my friends	 is what is truly scary about this film. Somebody thought it was a good idea to make it. <br /><br />Well	 here's another amazingly original story: High School student (occasionally seemed like collegego figure) has whore for a mom	 lives in a trailer park	 and is an ""artist"" who is ridiculed for his ""being all different."" Well	 of course	 this poor ridiculed boy is eventually killed and	 here's the original part	 his soul inhabits a scarecrow (beneath which	 he is killed by his slutty mama's latest john). Then he goes around with the standard killing off of all the people that done hurt him. Awww.<br /><br />Here's the breakdown:<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />--Amazingly funny movieeven if that's not what the clearly drunk filmmakers wanted.<br /><br />--This and the sequel on one disk in the Wal-Mart $5.00 binso it's only a little overpriced.<br /><br />Didn't Hurt It	 Didn't Help:<br /><br />--The violence and gore are kind of sub-standard. One person is stabbed with a corncob.<br /><br />--Sounds like they put some effort into the musicbut it doesn't really fit the movieand isn't all that good.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />--Terrible	 terrible acting.<br /><br />--Another slasher let-down with sexy womennone of them removing clothing. When did that cease being a staple of low-brow slashers??<br /><br />--Ridiculous story.<br /><br />--The scarecrow vomits up one-liners that would make Freddy Krueger and Arnold Swartzenegger blush.<br /><br />--Standard underlying love story goes nowhere	 and is poorly done.<br /><br />--Some of the people killed seem like they were chosen at randomyou never really know who anybody is and then they're killed. And you only assume that they must've had it coming.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />--Extremely average slasher fare	 just with a murdering scarecrow instead of well	 all that other crap.<br /><br />--Nowhere near as interesting as Freddy Krueger	 Jason Voorhees	 Pinhead	 Chucky	 or even Angela from the ""Sleepaway Camp"" seriesall of which are better than this atrocity.<br /><br />--The absolute worst dialogue I have ever heard in my LIFE. The script is laden with a level of retardedness that I never imagined could exist. I'm serious hereit's a full step beyond terrible. Don't get me wrong	 though	 it's funny as hellbut I've never heard more asinine bantereven in ""Slumber Party Massacre III."" This film makes ""Jason X"" look like Shakespeare.<br /><br />--The man who kills the boy that becomes the scarecrow: Worst wig ever. Dialogue to match.<br /><br />Memorable Scene:<br /><br />--The one where elementary-school youths spew out their own witty dialogue: ""Hey	 let's go find small animals to torture.

"At the end of ""Dragon Heat	"" all I could think of was why I bothered sitting through the whole thing.<br /><br />The film's premise is interesting and that - as well as Maggie Q - is what attracted me to the film in the first place. But was I ever disappointed. Writer-director Daniel Lee can't hold a candle to the likes of John Woo	 Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen.<br /><br />This has to be one of the most annoyingly-directed films I have ever seen. Lee is so wrapped up in his visual style - and I use that phrase incredibly loosely - that he fills the film with completely needless black-and-white stills	 freeze frames	 slow-motion	 fast-motion and other visual nonsense. I suppose he did all that to make up for the lack of a good story or dialogue.<br /><br />The action scenes are nothing special and play out like some hopped-up music video more than anything else. There is little to care about any of the characters - including two supposedly professional snipers who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn from the inside! - who are then laden with some of the cheesiest dialogue I have seen in one of these Hong Kong actioners.<br /><br />The plot is devoid of any twists and turns - from the initial set-up	 everything unfolds in predictable fashion - and Lee feels the need to keep reminding us of the characters' back stories in case we didn't get it the first several times. This is awfully amateurish writing and film-making and wastes the talents of Sammo Hung	 Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. Though	 to be frank	 I am hard-pressed to remember Biehn being in any good film that was not directed by James Cameron.<br /><br />If you really are in the mood for a great Hong Kong actioner	 you are much better off sticking to some of the staples - John Woo's ""The Killer"" (1989) and ""Hard-Boiled"" (1992)	 Ringo Lam's ""City on Fire"" (1987) - which Quentin Tarantino stole for ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) - or his ""Point Blank"" (1967) remake	 ""Full Contact"" (1992). Or	 even check out Yuen's ""So Close"" (2002)	 a supremely entertaining	 yet preposterous	 popcorn flick. And there's always the terrific French police actioner	 ""The Nest"" (2002).<br /><br />True	 most	 if not all	 are a bit over-the-top	 but they were films that remain exciting	 thrilling and even suspenseful. They have characters we care about and mind-blowing action sequences.<br /><br />""Dragon Heat	"" on the other hand	 is just terribly mediocre. The trouble is that Lee has not made a bad action film	 he has made a dull one."	0.0
"There are three movies with this animation style that I fondly remember from my youth. This movie	 ""The Last Unicorn	"" ""Flight of Dragons"" and ""The Hobbit."" I own copies of both ""Dragons"" and ""The Hobbit"" (both excellent) and I hadn't seen ""The Last Unicorn"" in more than a decade. That was until today and now I wish I hadn't. What bothered me the most was the script. It was incredibly choppy and often inane. Things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation. We're not just talking about little things here either; we're talking about key plot points! The story itself isn't that great to begin with	 but it could have worked had the script been decent. Not even close. On top of that the music was awful! I know that music in movies such as these rarely have what one would call classic pieces	 but the music in this movie made me want to knock myself unconscious with a bowling ball. This was one of those films that I was going to show to my kids some day	 but it just got cut. I don't think I could ever sit through that crap fest again. Disappointed is putting it mildly."	0.0
"Steven Seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close-up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources. To pick on the technical flaws - silver F/A-18s and F-14s take of from a carrier for an air-strike	 and miraculously become camouflaged F-16s for the actual strike - would give this movie more credibility than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe	 which presumably is available to all users of Final Cut Pro. Putting all your creativity into your own credit puts Michael Keusch in the same category as Marcel Mandu."	0.0
"Visually disjointed and full of itself	 the director apparently chose to seek faux-depth to expand a 5 minute plot into an 81 minute snore-fest. <br /><br />The moments that work in this film are VERY limited	 and the characters don't even feel real. How could you feel invested in a main protagonist who was made so surreal? <br /><br />Substantively AND stylistically	 it all feels like a quirky dream sequence. Jarring irregular camera work	 awkward silences and gaps in action	 and what's with the little spider image crawling across the screen? Whoever thought of that needs to go back to film school. It added no meaning	 just cheese	 and didn't even stylistically work with the rest of the film (assuming the film even had a style	 which is a close call). What a flop."	0.0
"Not a bad word to say about this film really. I wasn't initially impressed by it but it grew on me quickly. I like it a lot and I think its a shame that many people can't see past the fact that it was banned in some territories	 mine being one of them. The film delivers in the shock	 gore and atmosphere department. The score is a beautiful piece of suspense delivering apparatus. It only seems fair that Chris Young went on to be one of the best composers in the business. The acting in this film is of a somewhat high standard	 if a little wooden in some spots	 and the effects are very real and gritty. All of this is high praise for a good slasher film in my book. I've noted in some reviews that the film has gotten serious flack having the famous killer's P.O.V shot. And I ask: WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT??? It is a classic shot that evokes dread into any good fan of the genre and is a great to keep the killer's identity a secret. The only thing that stops this film getting top marks in my book is that the surprise twist(killer revealed) is not handled with more care	 I mean it just happens kind of quickly	 though the great performances make it just about credible. Aside from that PRANKS is a great movie (though I prefer the original title) and its a shame that so many people knock it off as just a cheap piece of crap. Its more than that	 but only few know that as it seems to have gotten lost in the haze of early 80s slasher. What a shame.... Its a really good movie people! Believe me!"	1.0
"Watching this film for the action is rather a waste of time	 because the figureheads on the ships act better than the humans. It's a mercy that Anthony Quinn couldn't persuade anyone else to let him direct any other films after this turkey.<br /><br />But it is filled with amusement value	 since Yul Brynner has hair	 Lorne Greene displays an unconvincing French accent	 and the rest of the big names strut about in comic-book fashion."	0.0
"The first part	 Che in Cuba	 is about that portion of his life. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded (remember that Che was a physician). It ends as Castro wins the revolution; Che never gets to Havana. The second part	 Che in Bolivia	 is about guess what. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded.<br /><br />When I realized this was supposed to be an ""epic"" (I never knew *anything* but the title before it started)	 I naturally thought of the greatest epic of them all	 David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia. More of that later.<br /><br />Not to be a racist	 but aside from what I've already mentioned is the fact that there are too many characters who are	 well	 indistinguishable -- unknown Hispanic actors who look alike	 especially considering they all wear ""Che"" beards and all wear Che fatigues. This results in the viewer not being able to identify with anyone other than Che	 Benicio del Toro (even Fidel has a very minor role). While del Toro's terrific	 think of ""Lawrence"" with Peter O'Toole as the only discernible character: no Alec Guinness	 no Omar Sharif	 no Anthony Quinn	 etc. You get the idea.<br /><br />Because the other characters are interchangeable	 this results in a loss of reference. When top aides of Che are killed	 you feel no remorse since you don't know who they are. Even when Che is killed (I don't think that's a spoiler)	 there's no empathy from the audience -- he's just killed.<br /><br />He's too one-dimensional to relate to as a human being. Aside from being a revolutionary and second only to Jesus in moral rectitude	 the only thing we learn about Che is that he's married with five children (he tells another character that near the end). What was his motivation? A complete enigma.<br /><br />Maybe Soderbergh is purposely aping Lean. Like Soderbergh's Che	 Lean never lets us know anything about Lawrence	 the mystery man of Arabia. But at least Lawrence had a friend (Sharif) and associates (Guinness	 Quinn). He was as courageous as he was insecure -- i.e.	 had human qualities. Che is like a machine	 about as warm as The Terminator.<br /><br />Earlier this year there was another war epic	 Mongol. Che makes Mongol look like It's a Wonderful Life."	0.0

"A hint I think may be gathered by the various comments on this thread.<br /><br />I was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film who want to make it ""mandatory"" or ""compulsory"".<br /><br />I think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying it is so polarizing.<br /><br />The Global Warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to force others to ""do right"". It appeals particularly to more ""liberal"" leaning people because it doesn't have to do with bedroom morality which is what usually gets conservatives who want to force you to ""be good"" going.<br /><br />And that's the problem with the film. Al Gore is a politician. And a very successful one at that. He just can't help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would. The political appeal is just too great.<br /><br />And there we are left with a scientific issue that may be of huge importance	 reduced to a political issue appealing to those in the body politic with a predilection to force other to ""do right"".<br /><br />Another interesting question is how did the Environmental movement get hijacked by such people?"	0.0
"It's the same old	 ""If I can't get the funding for my project	 I'll inject myself"" monster movie. There is nothing new here. It's a lot like the Jeff Goldblum ""Fly"" movie. The man manages to keep some semblance of sanity	 but eventually succumbs to the effects of his experiments. The acting is pretty bad. There are people acting stupidly all along the way	 putting their lives in danger for no apparent reason. The guy keeps going back to the lab he has been forbidden to enter. Then there's his relationship with a young woman and her son. Admittedly	 he is good looking	 but he seems like a lot of trouble. It's just a pretty big waste of time. Even his tyrannosaurus suit looks like it came off the rack at a Star Trek convention."	0.0
"This is a copy of the 1948 Doris Day classic	 Romance on the High Seas.<br /><br />The story line is more or less same but is contemporary. Govinda plays a sharp witted fellow who replaces the husband on the trip. While Rani plays the college friend of the wife who does her the same favour. They ostensibly try to catch each other out while the actual husband and wife tries to trip each other in Bombay.<br /><br />On the trip	 Govinda mistakes another girl for Sanjiv's wife and spies on her while falling in love with the ravishing Rani.<br /><br />Lever plays a dual role of father and son both lawyers specialising in divorce proceedings. They are pitted against each other for the warring couple.<br /><br />It is a poor attempt at copying the original classics and the songs are quite appalling. The comedy is slap-stick and will not make one laugh too much."	0.0
"Jeff Lowell has written & directed 'Over Her Dead Body' poorly. The idea is first of all	 is as stale as my jokes and the execution is just a cherry on the cake.<br /><br />Minus Eva Longoria Parker there is hardly anything appealing in this film. Eva looks great as ever and delivers a likable performance.<br /><br />Paul Rudd looks jaded and least interested. Lake Bell is a complete miscast. She looks manly and delivers a strictly average performance. Jason Biggs is wasted	 so is Lindsay Sloane.<br /><br />I expected entertainment more from this film. Sadly	 I didn't get entertained."	0.0
"After reading tons of good reviews about this movie I decided to take it for a spin (I bought it on DVD	 hence the ""spin"" pun...I'm a dork). The beginning was everything I hoped for	 a perfect set-up (along with some quotes that I've heard on Various Wu-Tang albums) to what should have been a good movie. But the plot I heard was so great	 was so predictable. Every time I saw a character (except for the Lizard) I guessed which Venom he was. Plus	 the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie. Ok	 so the plot wasn't very good but at least there was some good kung-fu right? Wrong. The fights were very short and few and far between. Granted the different styles were all pretty cool but I wish the fights were longer. I kept hoping to see the Lizard run and do some crazy ish on the walls but it never happened. I was hoping to see the Centipede do some tight speedy ish but it never happened. I was hoping to see the Scorpion in the movie for more than 7 total minutes but it never happened. In short	 not much happens. The fighting is all pretty routine. Don't be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot	 it does not mean it's a good one."	1.0

"There is no greater disservice to do to history than to misrepresent it. This takes the easiest and most shallow route	 simply portraying him as a monster. Only showing his negative sides	 and exaggerating them. ""Those who are ignorant of the past doom us to repeat it"". He was a human being. That may prove tough to some people to accept	 but an important part of life is facing that which we don't want to. Rather than demonizing the man	 we ought to try to understand him. Otherwise	 we stand little chance of preventing anyone similar in the future	 or possibly even the present	 from succeeding at anything of remotely comparable scope	 as far as damage and misery goes. Hate him and what he did	 don't make him into something mythical	 intentionally or otherwise. Frankly	 far too much of this mini-series could play ""dumb dumb *duuum*!"" after or during scenes. The whole thing nods	 nudges and winks at the audience	 with a clear message of ""was this guy evil or what""	 incorporating every single bad trait(as well as making up several that go directly against who and what he was)	 letting them appear more or less out of nowhere	 and having them be constant throughout his life	 not something he came to believe or claimed to. This should never be used to educate. Use Der Untergang(Downfall	 in English)	 and maybe point out the few inaccuracies of that	 instead. This	 this is disrespectful to the actual events that took place	 and to any and all survivors	 not to mention those who died. The cinematic quality? Top-notch. It's well-done	 through and through	 excellent production values	 a solid arc to the well-told plot	 what characterization does occur is strong and credible	 dialog and script are great	 all acting performances are masterful(Carlyle looks and behaves the role... as it was written... perfectly)	 the music is well-composed	 cinematography and editing are flawless and creative	 and this is definitely dramatic	 entertaining and riveting. They get dates and many occurrences	 and do them justice. If I had been offered to work on this	 and did not feel I could be objective enough to have Hitler appear as a fully fleshed-out person	 I would have declined	 citing that as the reason. I don't blame anyone for loathing him. How can you forgive what he did	 and are we sure that we should? That is not what I am suggesting. Finally	 let me point out that	 as I write this	 we are in a world-wide economic crisis that has lasted for about two years	 and that is not terribly dissimilar to the stock market crash of 1929. The two reasons it hasn't led to a depression of the new millennium are as follows: governments are giving money to the banks to keep the market going	 and the majority of the countries is now friendly towards one another. Apart from that	 the lesson hadn't been learned. Hopefully	 it has now. Back to this... my suggestion? Read a book	 non-fiction	 dealing with the subject. There are plenty of informative	 smart ones. The DVD holds a trailer. I recommend this only to those who know better	 and vehemently urge anyone who has watched it	 to seek out the truth. 8/10"	1.0
"This movie is entertaining enough due to an excellent performance by Virginia Madsen and the fact that Lindsey Haun is lovely. However the reason the movie is so predictable is that we've seen it all before. I've haven't read the book A Mother's Gift but I hope for Britney and Lynne Spears sake it is completely different than this movie. Unless you consider ending a movie with what is essentially a music video an original idea	 the entire movie brings to mind the word plagiarized."	0.0
"I believe Sarafina is a tremendous effort of Whoopi Goldberg. Besides her	 there are no other stars in the film and her role is smaller than the title character	 Sarafina. Since I work in a high school with urban children	 I think this is an important film to show South African history of apartheid. Sarafina is a movie about education and a teacher's relationship with her student	 Sarafina. I bought the video for practically nothing at a videostore. I watched it and fast forwarded through the musical numbers. But I strongly recommend this film to educators and their students to understand. Now while I don't know the other actors and actresses in the film	 I assume that they are very popular in South Africa and I am glad that they filmed with a South African cast and crew with the exception of Goldberg in a small role but if it gets people to see this movie	 than Whoopi reaches worldwide appeal."	1.0
"I just watched I. Q. again tonight and had forgotten how much I love this movie. It is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that all is right with the world. I love the allusions to Mozart all throughout from the opening with ""Einstein"" playing ""Twinkle	 Twinkle Little Star"" on the violin to him humming Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during the IQ testing of the Ed Walters. I love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career	 an especially unique situation for the 1950's	 the time in which this movie is set. (I myself have been a teacher but stayed at home to raise my children	 so please don't think I am some staunch women's libber.) It's wonderful how a man who is ""only a grease monkey"" is finally seen to be just as important and worthy as Catherine's fiance	 a clinical behavioral researcher. The message to me is that we are not what we do	 but who we are is defined by so much more - no labels. There are so many little gags and one-liners that are almost throwaways if you don't watch and listen carefully.<br /><br />I did catch a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page. In the scene when Ed Walters is to speak at symposium	 there are 3 instruments (protractor	 ruler	 etc.) hanging on the right from the chalk ledge. In the next camera shot	 there only 2. In the credits on our video	 it lists Tony Shaloub's character as Bob Watters	 not Bob Rosetti as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on Imdb.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. It may be a piece of fluff in some estimations	 but has lots more substance than many give it credit for. Not only that	 what a great cast is assembled here. Watch it and enjoy!"	1.0
"THE KING MAKER will doubtless be a success in Thailand where the similar (but superior) 'The Legend of Suriyothai' set box office records. The film directed by Lek Kitaparaporn after a screenplay by Sean Casey based on historical fact in 1547 Siam has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is disarmed by one of the corniest	 pedestrian scripts and story development on film.<br /><br />The event the picture relates is the arrival of the Portuguese soldier of fortune Fernando de Gamma (Gary Stretch) whose vengeance for this father's murderer drives him to shipwrecked	 captured and thrown into slavery and put on the bloc in Ayutthaya in the kingdom of Siam where he is purchased by the beautiful Maria (Cindy Burbridge) with the consent of her father Phillipe (John Rhys-Davies)	 a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses. There is a plot to overthrown the King and Fernando and his new Siamese sidekick Tong (Dom Hetrakul)	 after some gratuitous CGI enhanced choreographed martial arts silliness	 are first rewarded by the King to become his bodyguards	 only to be imprisoned together once Queen Sudachan (Yoe Hassadeevichit) reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover Lord Chakkraphat (Oliver Pupart) to take over the rule of Siam. Yet of course Fernando and Tong escape and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families (Tong's wife and children and Fernando's now firm love affair with Maria) with the expected consequences.<br /><br />The acting (with the exception of John Rhys-Davies) is so weak that the film occasionally seems as though it were meant to be camp. The predominantly Thai cast struggle with the poorly written dialog	 making us wish they had used their native Thai with subtitles. The musical score by Ian Livingstone sounds as though exhumed form old TV soap operas. But if it is visual splendor you're after there is plenty of that and that alone makes the movie worth watching. It is a film that has obvious high financial backing for all the special effects and masses of cast and sets and shows its good intentions. It is just the basics that are missing. Grady Harp"	0.0
"This movie is very much like ""Flashdance""	 you know that dance flick with Jennifer Beals. That film is probably the most boring film I have ever seen since it's not even bad enough to be funny. ""G.I. Jane"" is much better than that film	 but that doesn't say much. Here Demi Moore sweats a lot and there's high music and we get to see her fight and everything	 but it is certainly not very engaging. I really think the idea behind the film is kind of interesting	 but the script is too clichéd and Ridley Scott can't do anything about that. Well	 like I said... It's better than ""Flashdance""...

"Fans of the HBO series ""Tales From the Crypt"" are going to love this MOH episode. Those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic EC comics were based on	 will recognize this one right off the bat.<br /><br />Underrated indie favorite Martin Donovan (also an excellent writer - co-author of the screenplays for APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH BECOMES HER) is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way. He could play a really nice if misunderstood guy-next-door	 or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness. In the case of RIGHT TO DIE	 he takes the latter approach	 and it definitely works.<br /><br />Donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist (Robin Sydney)	 much to the displeasure of his inconsolable	 unforgiving spouse	 Abbey (Julia Anderson). When the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of ""making up	"" and she's horribly burned in a fire	 he's reluctant to pull the plug on her	 not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy (Corbin Bernsen	 looking the worse for wear these days.) <br /><br />But Abbey's never been one to give up without a fight	 and that's where the EC-theme of the episode comes in. Cuckolded husbands - and wives - have always been the genre's favorite subject matter for some spooky (and OOKY) supernatural shenanigans	 and this case is definitely no exception. If anything	 the ramped-up quotient of sex and gore must have Bill Gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere.<br /><br />And that's not to mention that John Esposito's original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist. You don't realize as you're watching that you only know half the story	 until close to the end...(think WHAT LIES BENEATH with more guts and gazongas	 and you're there.)<br /><br />Not a bad effort	 but not the best of the lot	 either. At least Rob Schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction	 especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed! As with most MOH episodes	 this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment	 so the extremely squeamish need not apply."	1.0
"For months I've been hearing about this little movie and now I've seen it. I find it cute	 cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other people's creative ideas in order to make their own one-joke premise of a movie. Troops	 Swingblade	 any of the million Blair Witch parodies come to mind. If all that these directors want is a foot inside Hollywood's door then they're doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how Hollywood makes films. How many times have you heard the phrase	 ""It's Animal House meets Back to the Future""; ""It's Wall Street meets Dead Poet's Society""; or ""Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars""?

"Lorne Michaels once again proves that he has absolutely no business producing movies.<br /><br />You'd think that after such dismal flicks ""Superstar""	 ""Night at the Roxbury""	 and ""Coneheads""	 he'd start to get the notion that maybe he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to movies (and many would argue that he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to television	 as well). Trying to make feature films out of skits that wore out their welcome the third time the were done on SNL makes no sense.<br /><br />I personally like Tim Meadows	 and think that he would be great in the right movie. It's a shame to see a talented guy wasted in a film that features unfunny after unfunny situation	 and caps it all with a dreadfully bad song and dance scene. Any laughs here will be because the movie is so bad	 not because it's funny.<br /><br />Oh well	 at least we can be thankful that there are many other tired SNL characters who will never have films done about them. It's just too bad that this one made it to the big screen."	0.0
"This is far worse than those awful Laurel and Hardy cartoons of the 60s. They were terrible	 but at least they were simple ripoffs of a then Stan and Ollie resurgence. New audiences had rediscovered the pair's comedic genius and the cartoons were mind-numbing garbage geared to cash in on children's interest. It was to be expected. But	 how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of... I can't even think of a word. I'm sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another Laurel and Hardy revival	 but you can't inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing. The impressionists (I hesitate to call them actors) do a Vegas act and that's where it belongs. The plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days	 trying to stretch out two-reel ideas for a feature. If this film was someone's first exposure to the REAL Laurel and Hardy	 I'm sure that viewer would dismiss the original duo's reputation as senility gone amok. The only movie I hate worse than this is I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE. And	 you know	 these filmmmakers basically did the same thing to Stan and Ollie."	0.0
"Just PPV'd this. I don't want to waste too much time on this as most of the posters here put it better than I ever could	 but I did want to say a few things.<br /><br />I didn't know which was funnier: Redgrave chasing tiny moths and tripping over her nurse; Close wailing that her ""precious"" boy (whom she and the Mr. had decided was a drunken loser) has been turned into roadkill; that the tone-deaf Ann schmoozed with Peggy Lee; or the horrid CGI of Crypt Keeper Annie gazing at her younger self!<br /><br />I never bought Danes as the younger Redgrave. I didn't buy Richardson and Collette as sisters	 either. If Meryl Streep's daughter wants to be an actress	 she better get Mama to give her a few lessons!

"NOTE TO ALL DIRECTORS: Long is not necessarily good. This movie is incredibly long. However not good. The scenes were drawn out way	 way	 way	 way	 way too long. The sex scenes were unnecessary	 and often too long. The movie edited down to 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would have been exceptional	 but alas it became so boringly long that I can only give it a 2 of 10. It is way below average.<br /><br />Some other problems also exist in this marathon. <br /><br />1) Ralph Fiennes plays a whole family tree. The guy who played the Great-grandfather looks nothing like him	 but the Grandfather	 Father and the son (who gives us constant unneeded voice over) are all Ralph Fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic bull-headed personality. No one seems to notice that each of these children look like a clone of the last	 even though photos of them are being snapped at every turn. This one is minor	 but if the movie hadn't been 3 weeks long it wouldn't have been so annoying.<br /><br />2) The fact that no news from Germany was even whispered for the longest time about Jews being rounded up and sent off is ridiculous. Some word would have gotten to them and the thought of trying to run off would probably have been discussed. The uncle in France would surely have sent warning to try and get them to leave.<br /><br />3) The love stories in this movie are totally wrong. You are spending forever telling us this thing and the development of relationships between main characters is extremely short. Suddenly... people are in love and almost instantly... married. Then having children. Then we draw things out for 6 centuries and forget about developing relationships. This again would not have stuck out so much in a 2 hour movie	 but with time spent nothing was given to us.<br /><br />4) The ending was just bad. I don't want to spoil it for anyone	 but you won't like it either...unless you are sadistic.<br /><br />The director/writer should be tortured with having to watch this bloated garbage on a weekly basis	 I mean endless loop	 oops they are the same thing. <br /><br />I wonder if Robert Redford did anything for this movie	 I mean I think Istvan Szabo must be modeling his directing career after him. Long drawn out movie which totally ruins any substance in the movie. A short description of 'The Horse Whisperer'	 and Sunshine.<br /><br />Sunshine	 perfect title.

Viewers who've read the accounts of Boyer's toupee (it kept coming unstuck in the heat) will snicker every time it makes an appearance.<br /><br />Dietrich and Boyer rarely look at each other when giving their lines -- instead they gaze dreamily off into the distance	 presumably so their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most advantageous light (if you're starring in a turkey might as well look good!). Dietrich's costumes are out of this world. As Riva notes in her book	 Dietrich managed to steal Paramount's Travis Banton and have him design some of the most divine gowns	 such as the chiffon beige dress & cape.<br /><br />I heartily agree with the other reviewers who rave about the Technicolor. It really is hard to believe the film was done in 1936 -- the color is fantastic.<br /><br />In short	 if you watch The Garden of Allah with a lenient attitude and embrace its silliness	 you can't help but enjoy it."	1.0
"""My child	 my sister	 dream <br /><br />How sweet all things would seem <br /><br />Were we in that kind land to live together	 <br /><br />And there love slow and long	 <br /><br />There love and die among <br /><br />Those scenes that image you	 that sumptuous weather.""<br /><br />Charles Baudelaire <br /><br />Based on the novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim	 ""Enachanted April"" can be described in one sentence  it takes place in the early 1920s when four London women	 four strangers decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April. It is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that ""Enchanted April"" - an ultimate ""feel good"" movie is perfection of its genre. Lovely and sunny	 tender and peaceful	 kind and magical	 it is like a ray of sun on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever. This is the movie that actually affected my life. I watched it during the difficult times when I was lost	 unhappy and very lonely	 when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself. It helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible. I had promised to myself then that no matter what	 I would pull myself out of misery and self-pity and I would appreciate every minute of life - with its joy and its sadness...I promised myself that I would go to Italy and later that year I did and I was not alone.<br /><br />Charming	 enchanting	 and heartwarming	 ""Enchanted April"" is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love. This little film is a diamond of highest quality."	1.0
"Child 'Sexploitation' is one of the most serious issues facing our world today and I feared that any film on the topic would jump straight to scenes of an explicitly sexual nature in order to shock and disturb the audience. After having seen both 'Trade' and 'Holly'	 one film moved me to want to actually see a change in international laws. The other felt like a poor attempt at making me cry for five minutes with emotive music and the odd suicide. <br /><br />I do not believe that turning this issue into a Hollywood tear jerker is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt and I must commend the makes of 'Holly' for engaging subtly but powerfully with the terrible conditions these children are sadly forced to endure. 'Trade' wavered between serious and stupid with scenes involving the death of a cat coming after images that represented children being forced to commit some horrendous acts. I found this unengaging and at times offensive to the cause. If I had wanted a cheap laugh I would not have signed up for a film on child trafficking. <br /><br />For anyone who would like to watch a powerful film that actually means something I would suggest saving the money on the cinema ticket for the release of 'Holly'."	1.0

"This is the best film the Derek couple has ever made and if you think this is a recommendation then you haven't seen any of the others. There are the usual ingredients: it is just as poorly acted as their other efforts	 we can watch Bo disrobing or auditioning for wet T-shirt contests quite frequently	 the story is just laughably idiotic	 and the film takes itself much too seriously. And then: Orang Utans in Africa?<br /><br />But it has a few things going for it. Bo looks great	 the production values (sets	 costumes	 etc.) are quite good	 and this greatly enhances its camp value. In a strange way it is actually quite funny	 simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly."	0.0
"I've rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on DVD without reading any reviews about it. So	 after 15 minutes of watching I've noticed that something is wrong with this movie; it's TERRIBLE! I mean	 in the trailers it looked scary and serious!<br /><br />I think that Eli Roth (Mr. Director) thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid	 the movie would be funny...(So stupid	 it's funny...? WRONG!) He should watch and learn from better horror-comedies such as:""Fright Night""	 ""The Lost Boys"" and ""The Return Of the Living Dead""! Those are funny!<br /><br />""Cabin Fever"" is THE reason why I registered to www.IMDb.com so I can release my thoughts of discontent about it.<br /><br />I've decided to watch the movie a second time >AAARGH!< and make notes for my partial ""review"" to show how foolish the movie is. ""Resident Evil"" (horror) or ""Dude	 Where's My Car?"" (comedy) I can watch over and over again and still enjoy! But this...!<br /><br />How bad can a script and a director be??? This bad. Here are the awful scenes in chronological order:<br /><br />In the early scenes we see Henry	 who doesn't realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and dead-glazed stare is dead!<br /><br />The movie doesn't explain anything about the blonde long-haired kid who like to bite people.<br /><br />And my answer to Marcy's unanswered question (""What's wrong with the woods?"") is ""nothing"". The script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for ""suspense"".<br /><br />Then the ""smartest"" of the 5-pack	 Bert	 almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire. He meets now-infected Henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the ""F-word"". Bert starts to freak out because Henry looks awfully ill. Bert:""Don't make me shoot you!"" (he forgets to add: ""...with my BB gun!"")<br /><br />Bert heads back to the cabin but how about that? He meets Marcy and Jeff who were having sex	 but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk! Marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire Bert had started earlier (A moment of clarity for a change?) Bert doesn't mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his BB gun.<br /><br />Later	 as the Five Estupidos sit around their campfire	 another weirdo shows up with his dog. (Maybe that's what the warning about the woods is all about? It's filled with weirdos...and their dogs!?) They let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis. (Their brains are completely intoxicated! No wonder why they are all so DUMB!) This is the last time we'll see this forgettable character...alive!<br /><br />Henry shows up at their cabin	 (NOTE: He was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin!!!) looking worse	 almost like a zombie	 covered in goo! He says he needs a doctor. But the Young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker. He gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition. Henry almost seems smart enough to drive the Hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard	 seats and windows. The Fantastic Five come out running	 armed with: a BB Gun	 a knife	 a baseball bat (*huh? Ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods???)	 a poker	 and a (insecticide?) spray-can	 ready to combat the single	 unarmed and terribly sick man. (clever script!) Bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his BB Gun	 which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth. ""What else am I supposed to do?"" Bert yells in his defense. Jeff and Paul try to knock Henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the truck's windows instead. Henry walks up to the dumb girls who say: ""He's coming towards us!"" (Thanks for the info	 dumb broads	 I can see that! But I don't think he wants to do you any harm!) Marcy sprays in his eyes	 making Henry yelp! And our ""hero"" Paul touches Henry's arm with a burning log from the campfire	 which they recklessly left burning while they were INSIDE the cabin! (Where has all that wisdom gone? I guess the cannabis had started to take its toll!:-) Henry turns into The Human Torch and runs away	 screaming.<br /><br />The following day	 Bert and Jeff head out for a mechanic. And Marcy decides to ""go for help"" all by herself	 in the woods	 as Paul stays behind with Karen...Doesn't that sound idiotic? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already ""going for help""!<br /><br />I skip my comments now to how we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE rowing over a huge and winding river! How did she get a canoe? Does she even know where she's going!? Anyway	 she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and	 like in most horror movies	 walks inside the cabin saying:""Hello? Is anyone there?"" Bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her (and me at first). And along comes Jeff	 as well. How did THEY get here!? Did they swim across the river??? Do you see how brainless the script is!?<br /><br />Deputy Winston meets Paul at the cabin. He somehow doesn't notice the blood on their truck. This happens around 35 minutes of viewing and I have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the DVD out. (Before I take my own eyes out!...Now	 THAT's funny!)<br /><br />If you liked this movie	 do yourself a favor and watch ""Fright Night""	 ""The Lost Boys""	 or ""The Return of The Living Dead"". Then you'll see they are MORE entertaining than this...thing. Even the ""Toxic Avenger part 2""	 which is also a lousy film	 is way MORE funnier than ""Cabin Fever""."	0.0
"I used to watch this show when I was a little girl. When I think about it	 I only remember it vaguely. If you ask me	 it was a good show. Two things I remember vaguely are the opening sequence and theme song. In addition to that	 everyone was ideally cast. Also	 the writing was very strong. The performances were top-grade	 too. I hope some network brings it back so I can see every episode. Before I wrap this up	 I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever	 even though I don't think I've seen every episode. Now	 in conclusion	 if some network ever brings it back	 I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good."	1.0
"This movie has it all	 action	 fighting	 dancing	 bull riding	 music	 pretty girls. This movie is an authenic look at middle America. Believe me	 I was there in 1980. Lots of oil money	 lots of women	 and lots of honky tonks. Too bad they are all gone now. The movie is essentially just another boy meets girl	 boy loses girl	 boy gets girl back	 but it is redeemed by the actors and the music. There is absolutely no movie with any better music that this movie	 and that includes American Graffiti. It is a movie I watch over and over again and never get tired of it. Every time I watch it	 I am young again	 and it is time to go out honky tonking. The only reason I only gave it a 9 is because you cannot rate a movie zero	 I do not feel you should rate one 10."	1.0
"If you have not seen this excellent movie about life in the 90s (in L.A.) then you've missed a special treat. This is one of the most amazingly and most powerful movies ever made about life for Americans in the 90s and it even carries over into today's world in which we live in. It covers everything from raising a child	 prejudice (more than one way)	love	 adultery	 empty nest syndrome	 selfishness	 etc..and the list goes on. This story builds up to an ultimate climax and then when nothing else matters it always goes back to love with friends and family and love of life. It helps us dig deep within ourselves and to make us search for what we want out of life. Makes us ask questions of ourselves. Have we done enough for others	 are we like this	 etc.??? Sit back and enjoy a wonderfully done and emotional movie that I'm sure others will enjoy for a lifetime.<br /><br />Take note of Mary Mcdonnell	 Kevin Kline and Danny Glover's wonderful performance through this whole film. These actors are amazing and really show the true glow and meaning of what message is being sent to all of us. These are 3 of my favorite actors for life after seeing this film over 10 years ago now. I still enjoy it again and again. Also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with it and don't forget to count how many times you see the helicopter fly by and try to figure out it's symbolism for the movie??hmmm... I almost forgot this is probably Steve Martin's very first serious acting role in any film he has ever done. He	 too does an excellent job in this movie. This may come as a surprise to most of you. Sit back	 relax and enjoy truly good film making....."	1.0
"After reading several comments	 I felt I had to add in my two cents as well. ""Sorrow Lost"" is one of the most memorable shorts I think I have ever seen. I had gotten the chance to see this at the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was beautifully complex - especially for such a short amount of time. The story is focused on a young girl who is victimized by her abusive father. She is soon given the choice to ""stop"" him by a demon played by ""Witchblade's Eric Etebari."" Having watched the show	 I was amazingly impressed with how he played such unique and different character. I never knew he could act so well! His character was deeply complex and he was very persuasive. The acting was absolutely superb by him. The girl's was okay and the father's was decent. There is also death in this who follows the girl around until she is able to escape from her future. The effects and cinematography were absolutely mind blowing. I wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budget for this. It is rare you get to see such a high quality short. The opening was absolutely breathtaking comparable with any major feature film. This isn't to say that it's not without its flaws - I thought it took a little to get going and the intro was a little long. But this stuck in my head days after watching it. There are very few shorts with this level of quality."	1.0
"First I would like to say how great this. It is astounding and sometimes shocking. And to say the least I'm 11 years old and this is my favorite movie	 I can definitely stand a boring film	 but this is anything but boring. It is like a trip through humanity. Its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece. It is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers (VOIGHT AND Hoffman) who build a mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT) a naive Texan stud comes to New York to make it rich by entertaining women. Soon he meets Rico 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN)	 who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent. Ratso becomes Joe's 'manager' but soon both men can't find Joe a job which results in stealing food. As they try and survive on the streets of New York we realize how tough it is. They can't get Joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party. Joe makes some money and soon Joe takes Ratso on a Ratso's dream spot	 Florida. The final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film. From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life."	1.0
"Well	 what can you say about a Barbara Cartland adaptation?<br /><br />There are some amazing actors in this (Oliver Reed	 Sarah Miles	 Christopher Plummer) but they clearly are clocking up the money.<br /><br />Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland epics - Anthony with Hugh Grant (who looks suitably embarrassed) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />If you really want to see a ""watchable"" adaptation of Cartland	 the Bonham Carter one is the one to go for (""A Hazard of Hearts"" - what a title!!). Gilbert is the weak link in that	 but Bonham Carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act	 and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)"	0.0

"Actually my vote is a 7.5. Anyway	 the movie was good	 it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it	 don't misunderstand me	 is not the funniest movie of the world	 and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies	 but this one has its own taste	 a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends... I think that not exactly but who cares? Also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic	 Chris Rock appears in it	 the name is Down to Earth	 men	 that one its a very funny movie	 see both if you want and I know that you will agree that Mr. Rock won with his movie. I would liked that the protagonist male character were given to Ashton Kutcher	 however	 the film is good."	1.0
"Lee hosted the 100 Years of Horror for Ted Newsom and was talking about filmic werewolves. He said something to the effect that his only brush with lycanthropy was The Howling II	 then he quipped	 ""The less said about that the better."" Indeed he was right as this film may very well be the worst in his entire catalog of screen performances. The first Howling by Joe Dante was a groundbreaking werewolf film with its incredible special effects and its campy sense of style and subject matter. It was a film to be taken seriously. Like other good original films	 filmmakers for some strange reason thought that even more campy sequels were needed rather than what worked the first time(See CHUD then CHUD II to illustrate this point). This film is miles and miles away from the first on every front. There is absolutely nothing scary about it. It looks cheap and is pitch black through most of the major scenes. Lee is the only actor in the film worth mentioning(okay	 I'll cede Ferdy Mayne too). Lee looks embarrassed as he says inane dialog and does ridiculous things(check out that ending with him and Stirba). Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what dreck this is which is a tad more insightful than the two leads who leave America to go to Romania. The story isn't really worth examining here	 and you can bet there is very little story worth mentioning when you have to have Stephen Parsons and his band Babel play through much of the film in the beginning and the ending with that dreadful noise. Sybil Danning is here and	 yes	 she disrobes once and then we get that scene showed again and again and again - one reviewer said 17 times(I counted ten - but might have been so bored out of my mind by that point). I gave the film three stars	 but it really deserves a zero - the three I gave it are 1 for Lee and two for Ms. Danning's contributions. Yuck!"	0.0
"Due to reading bad reviews and being told by friends that they couldn't believe how bad it was	 I didn't go and see this film at the cinema. After watching it on DVD	 I have to say I regret that now. I'm not saying it is brilliant	 but I would venture to say that it is a good movie. I enjoyed it.<br /><br />People have skulls thicker than Ned's helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary. If you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures	 there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal. I don't think Ganghis Kahn has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact. What kind of man Ned Kelly actually was is a matter of debate	 and quite passionate it seems. In spite of the efforts of governments and some historians	 Ned Kelly has become a legend. Legends are stories	 and stories say as much about those who tell and listen to them as they do about the actual figure himself. Ned Kelly has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of Australian culture that doesn't trust or accept authority. A society in which there is no dissent or challenge to authority is crazier and more dangerous than any bushranger.<br /><br />So not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical Kelly gang	 I actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie. It was sentimental and romantic	 but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been; for my fellow Australians	 watch 'The Lighthorseman' and you will see what I mean (it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly). Perhaps the love affair business could have been forsaken for a bit more detail in other areas	 such as the shooting of the troopers. Ironically	 I actually enjoyed the movie because of that	 because it would be those details that most of the focus on Ned's story would dwell. And they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historians.<br /><br />This movie was always going to have a hard time	 having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market (to pay the pills) and the legend as it means to Australians; perhaps a little of Ned's spirit is in this movie	 because I think it rebelled against people's expectations	 and unfortunately missed both targets. Fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film. For me it was an unexpected kind of movie about Ned	 and that is why I liked it. Orlando Bloom's performance did a lot for the movie too - he really added something. I think he would have enjoyed being the monster instead of the pretty elf	 for a change.<br /><br />When you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one	 your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered. Send me this on DVD for christmas rather than Croc Dundee or The Man From Snowy River anytime."	1.0
"Early film directed by D.W. Griffith; it features a gloriously happy King (Arthur V. Johnson) and his Queen (Marion Leonard) - but	 wait! When the King leaves the scene	 his Queen makes music with the palace's Minstrel (Henry B. Walthall). When the King discovers the lovers	 he decides to enact a horrific Edgar Allen Poe-type revenge. It's difficult to believe the lovers can't hear those plotting against them; although the actors are trying to look alternately noisy (the lovers) and quiet (the cement mixers). The sets make ""The Sealed Room"" look very staged. The performances are okay	 and the story is easy to follow. <br /><br />*** The Sealed Room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson	 Henry B.

He trades his mechanical skills by some food and lodging	 and has an affair with Giovanna. They both decide to kill Giuseppe	 forging a car accident. The relationship of them become affect by the feeling of guilty and the investigation of the police. This masterpiece ends in a tragic way. The noir and neo-realistic movie of Luchino Visconti is outstanding. This is the first time that I watch this version of `The Postman Always Rings Twice'. I loved the 1946 version with Lana Turner	 and the 1981 version	 where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the hottest sex scene in the history of the cinema	 but this one is certainly the best.

"Once again a film classic has been pointlessly remade with predictably disastrous results. The title is false as is everything about this film. The period is not persuasively rendered	 and the leads seem way too young and too vapid to even be criminals. Arthur Penn's film had style	 humor	 a point of view	 and was made by talented people. Even if the 1967 version didn't exist this would still be an unnecessary film. The 1967 version strayed from the facts	 presented a glamorized version of Bonnie and Clyde	 but it was exciting	 and innovative for 1967	 and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care. This 1992 remake seems culled from the original film rather than the truth as known and the actors in this version are callow	 unappealing	 and not the least bit interesting. By all means skip this one and hope the 2010 version will be better. Could it possibly be worse?"	0.0
"This is one strange hacked together film	 you get the feeling that the bond company had to come in on this one	 I'm not surprised there's no credits on it	 who would want to be associated with this film. The Acting of all involved is terribly stilted and the plot jumps around all over	 it all makes very little sense. As I said before it looks like the bond company had to come in because it seems like there was alot of footage that wasn't shot that needed to be	 and all the music was very ill-fitting library music (cheap I guess). Very	 very odd. I might actually buy a DVD of it though	 if it could let me in on what the hell was going on	 and what happened to this movie."	0.0
"Except for acknowledging some nice cinematography	 I can hardly say anything positive about this movie. The single real issue is the protagonist's dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life. Abundant ""emotionally powerful"" scenes do not go with this plot and	 because of bad acting	 they also fail to create the intended atmosphere. The director only manages to introduce Anthony's dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution. The characters do not seem to evolve	 although it is difficult to speak of any characters... perhaps except for Sonny. Beside him	 actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to	 they come off as self-indulging amateurs. I wonder what ruined the movie more: the superficial script	 throwing away all the potential of the plot	 or the bad acting	 disturbing any appeal that might be left."	0.0
"Story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. Starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy. A formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane	 violent mob by the crazy chantings of it's singers. Unfortunately it stays absurd the WHOLE time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting. Even those from the era should be turned off. The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare seem easy to a third grader. On a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly."	0.0
"""Laughter is a state of mind"" says the tag	 and I hesitate to comment on Barry Levinson's. What could he have been thinking during the making of ""Toys""? When he watched the rushes	 did he see a successful	 funny fantasy? If so	 then he's working on a different plane than I. This is an excruciating picture	 one in which the production design is 90% of the thing (and even the cartoon colors are a disappointment). Robin Williams and (most especially) Joan Cusack are humiliated as brother and sister of a toy mogul who are bypassed as inheritors of the factory when their dad dies. There's nothing remotely funny (satirical or slapstick-wise) on display here. It is uniformly draggy	 ugly	 and one of the very worst ""big"" movies ever made. NO STARS from ****"	0.0
"I thought maybe a film which boasted a cast including Peter O'Toole	 Susannah York	 Michael Craig & Harry Andrews might be worth watching. Alas	 I was wrong. Utter pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with both O'Toole and York overacting wildly. I watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about. I've a feeling O'Toole plays the Laird of a Scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes reliving childhood games with his sister (York). He is also barking mad. But apart from that	 your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />The film has no redeeming feature whatsoever. I can only assume the cast and director were blackmailed into making this dreary	 unimaginative	 stagy piffle. Clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director. Risible."	0.0
"No-nonsense Inspector Hollaway (a solid turn by John Bennett) investigates the disappearance of a famous thespian and uncovers the wicked past history of a creepy old house. First and most mundane tale	 ""Method for Murder"" - Successful author Charles Hillyer (nicely played by Denholm Elliott) is haunted by images of the murderous fiend he's writing about in his latest book. Although this particular outing is too obvious and predictable to be anything special	 it does nonetheless build to a real dilly of a genuine surprise ending. Second and most poignant anecdote	 ""Waxworks"" - Lonely Philip Grayson (the always outstanding Peter Cushing) and his equally lonesome friend Neville Rogers (the splendid Joss Ackland) both become infatuated with the beguiling wax statue of a beautiful	 but lethal murderess. Third and most chilling vignette	 ""Sweets to the Sweet"" - Quiet	 reserved and secretive widower John Reid (a typically terrific Christopher Lee in a rare semi-sympathetic role) hires nanny Ann Norton (the fine Nyree Dawn Porter) to take care of his seemingly cute and harmless daughter Jane (a remarkably spooky and unnerving performance by the adorable Chloe Franks). This stand-out scary episode is given a substantial disturbing boost by the exceptional acting from gifted child actress Franks	 who projects a truly unsettling sense of serene evil lurking just underneath a deceptively sweet and innocent angelic veneer. Fourth and most amusing yarn	 ""The Cloak"" - Pompous horror movie star Paul Henderson (delightfully essayed to the haughty hilt by Jon Pertwee) purchases a mysterious cloak that causes him to transform into a vampire whenever he wears it. This item makes for good silly fun and further benefits from the awesomely pulchritudinous presence of the luscious Ingrid Pitt as enticing vampiress Carla. Director Peter Duffell	 working from a deliciously macabre and witty script by noted horror scribe Robert Bloch	 maintains a snappy pace throughout and does an ace job of creating a suitably eerie atmosphere. Kudos are also in order for Ray Parslow's crisp cinematography and the shuddery score by Michael Dress. Highly recommended to fans of omnibus fright fare."	1.0

"Dieter Bohlen	 Germany's notorious composer and producer of slightly trashy pop hits like ""You're my heart	 you're my soul"" felt the need to tell his story - and gracefully he decided to hire a ghost writer. The result was a funny book about his life. Well	 more or less a fuzzy image of it. He didn't deny that he is a selfish asshole but the whole story was twisted to fit his image of himself. No word that he has probably beaten up his former wife and she ended up in hospital. However it was written in a funny style and a huge success after his appearance as jury member of the German version of ""American Idol"" - especially his unforgettable comments.<br /><br />This should be the end of the story - really. In the hype of the mentioned ""Idol"" TV show called ""Deutschland sucht den Superstar"" (abbreviated DSDS) somebody must have come up with the terrible idea to make a movie out of the book. The result is ""Dieter - der Film""<br /><br />I have rarely seen a movie which tries so desperately to be funny and fails so completely. None of the gags really hits the point. Naddel's voice and style of talking was getting on my nerves right away although Verona's voice should have done that more. Obvious	 childish	 predictable and lengthy gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie to the end within a few minutes. The content of the movie is a sloppy film adaption written sloppily down by a ghost writer based on Bohlen's sloppy idealized memory. They could have used this freedom to do almost everything. It was supposed to be a satire	 but they failed. The story is totally uninteresting and the fact that the background voice is Bohlen himself guarantees that the whole film has nothing satirical at all.<br /><br />It's no wonder that it was considered to bad for a cinema release. The probability that this thing would have rotten in some archive was quite high until recently when the current season of DSDS turned out to be a mediocre success. With the ""friendly"" help of Germany's biggest yellow press newspaper ""BILD"" and the desperate situation for the TV station RTL to have something in the program while the still unbeatable show ""Wetten dass... ?"" is running on Channel 2 the movie finally arrived in television - unfortunately.<br /><br />Watching this movie is a waste of time - there are certainly better cartoons with much more fun and a story actually worth looking at.<br /><br />Therefore: 2/10"	0.0
"I love this film. It is well written and acted and has good cinematography. The story blends action	 humor	 mysticism	 and tenderness with great sets and beautiful location shots. See it	 buy it	 show it to your friends.<br /><br />The acting is good and Murphy especially does a fine job portraying the reluctant/unlikely hero. I enjoyed all the characters and found them to be interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions.<br /><br />I cared what happened to these people and	 while the outcome was pretty predictable (the good guys win	 the hero gets the astonishingly attractive girl and the holy child saves lives--who doesn't see that coming?)	 it still made me happy when everything worked out well in the end. Thank God this film's dignity was never ruined with a crappy sequel. Grab some popcorn	 cuddle up on the couch	 and watch this fun	 happy and entertaining film."	1.0
"I commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a ""thumbs in the middle"" review	 remarking that I'd give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode. I've seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in June 2006. And as a lifelong Batman fanatic	 I can say without hesitation: this show is utter crap.<br /><br />Everything's wrong with it. Everything. Getting past just the lousy animation and design	 the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories.<br /><br />And for God's sake...is it just me	 or is the Joker in EVERY EPISODE?? Is Gotham that much of a revolving-door justice system? Or	 again	 is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains (see ""no character development""	 above).<br /><br />And to make matters worse	 every single Joker tale is the same 3-part formula.<br /><br />1) Joker gasses people.<br /><br />2) Joker sets out to gas the whole city.<br /><br />3) Batman saves the day.<br /><br />Pfeh.<br /><br />There was one episode I saw that wasn't a Joker story. The title escapes me	 but the villain was that nefarious Cluemaster...the ""Think Thank Thunk"" episode with the quiz show. That was the single-worst Batman story I've ever seen	 heard or read. Yes	 worse than ""I've Got Batman in My Basement."" <br /><br />I can't really say what I feel this show is because it's probably against the ToS	 but it starts with ""B"" and rhymes with ""fastardization"". Thank goodness for the existence of the Timm/Dini/etc. era of Bat-entertainment	 back from the Fox and Kids WB days. Stuff that good	 and I should have known this	 just couldn't possibly have lasted forever	 unfortunately."	0.0
"FUTZ is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in New York in the 1960s (the origins of Off Off Broadway). Though it's not for everyone	 it is a genuinely brilliant	 darkly funny	 even more often deeply disturbing tale about love	 sex	 personal liberty	 and revenge	 a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when Congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our Constitution. The story is not about being gay	 though -- it's about love and sex that don't conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate. On the surface	 it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig	 but like any great fable	 it's not really about animals	 it's about something bigger -- stifling conformity in America.<br /><br />The stage version won international acclaim in its original production	 it toured the U.S. and Europe	 and with others of its kind	 influenced almost all theatre that came after it. Luckily	 we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived	 with the original cast and original director	 Tom O'Horgan (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway).<br /><br />This is not a mainstream	 easy-to-take	 studio film -- this is an aggressive	 unsettling	 glorious	 deeply emotional	 wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you'll never forget. And it just might change the way you see the world..."	1.0
"1991 saw the release of the two best sequels of all time: TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY and BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY. Out of the two	 I've always liked BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY a bit better. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is the better made	 but there's just nothing like Bill and Ted. Besides Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY	 it's hard to think of a greater comedic duo than Bill and Ted. They are one of a kind.<br /><br />Seemingly influenced by National Lampoon's O.C. and Stiggs	 Bill and Ted were created by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson	 two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo while performing at a local theater in L.A. back in the 1980s. The two quickly began writing a screenplay about two and before long BILL & TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE was born. The film	 shot in 1987 and released in 1989	 became a big box office success and an instant cult classic. It wasn't long before work began on the sequel. Stephen Herek	 the director of 'EXCELLENT ADVENTURE' wasn't keen on working on the sequel since he considered it to be too mean-spirited and unlike the first one so Peter Hewitt	 making his feature film debut	 was brought in to direct the sequel. There couldn't have been a better director for the job. BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is marvelously directed. It's filled with its own unique style and energy that can't be matched.<br /><br />What makes 'BOGUS JOURNEY' one of the best sequels ever is that it while it is darker than the original	 it is just as fun. It doesn't change the characters like most sequels do. Bill and Ted are the same lovable characters that they were in the first film. This is because it was written by the original writers. Most sequels are not written by the same writers as the first one	 but since 'BOGUS JOURNEY' had the same screenwriters	 it ended up being just as good as 'EXCELLENT ADVENTURE' if not even better. Just like the first one	 'BOGUS JOURNEY' is absolutely hilarious	 well written	 fun	 and above all	 original. It's filled with spectacular special effects and fantastic comedic performances from Alex Winter	 Keanu Reeves	 and William Sadler. It's an unforgettable 'journey'. 10/10"	1.0
"The only redeeming quality of this overlong miscast melodrama is the scenery of southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri singing the theme song. Stephanie Powers is miscast and betrayed by a phony accent. As has been pointed out	 she is too old to play an 18 year old and looks far too young as a grandmother with a college age granddaughter? Lee Remick is good although she also is ageless in her later years. The talented Joanna Lumley is under utilized and also manages to look forever young when her middle aged son (Robert Urich) finally marries Grandma Stephanie Powers. Stacey Keach's ceaseless arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him. Don't know how any viewer could relate to his excessive portrayal? The most credible performance is given by Ian Richardson	 who makes the rest of the cast look like rank amateurs. It strains credulity that the handsome male suitors in this epic would remain ever single while they patiently await the subject of their affections to finally consent to accept them. Can anybody believe that handsome Robert Urich would remain single for decades waiting for Stephanie Powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposals? The WW2 engagement between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is laughable. To begin with	 the Germans did not occupy the Provence section of France until late in the war	 it was controlled by the Vichy French puppet government. We see the French resistance staging a daylight raid on Mistral's villa to steal sheets after which they all lounge under a bridge waiting for a lumbering truckload of Nazi troops to surprise and annihilate them? If you want to see a well acted mini-series set in a foreign country	 don't watch Mistral's Daughter. A far better alternative would be The Thorn Birds."	0.0
"I bought this on DVD for my brother who is a big Michelle Pfeiffer fan. I decided to watch it myself earlier this week.<br /><br />It is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two. She plays a rising Hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships. She literally bumps into Brian Kerwin (A regular married guy with Kids)after driving her car into the back of his. After being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive. Romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out. What happens at the end I was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine TV direction takes any drama out of the plot.<br /><br />The other section involves an old Studio boss played by Darren McGavin. This section actually has the better cast with Kenneth McMillan	 Lois Chiles	 Steven Bauer & Stella Stevens. They all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign	 they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere. <br /><br />It passes the time but is not all that interesting and I am glad this was not bought for me. I am not a Michelle Pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress. Overall though unless you are a fan of hers avoid this as it is very routine."	0.0
"It is pretty surreal what these flies can do... eh well... this is a cartoon	 so anything can happen in it.<br /><br />At first I must tell you that I love animated movies. Unfortunately this year's repertoire is very weak. This cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws:<br /><br />1) I quoted the tag line. It suggests that this movie has great 3D effects. Well	 I did not see any	 at least not something special I never saw before.<br /><br />2) The ""flies"" in this movie look nothing like real flies. At least they could've make them black. But cyan flies	 seriously? With giant heads and slim torsos?<br /><br />3) The story. I guess it was written for 6 year old kids. I could tell it in two sentences it is so over simplified.<br /><br />4) Excessive patriotism. For example: ""They are American files after all!"" Oh	 give me a break."	0.0
"I had really only been exposed to Olivier's dramatic performances	 and those were mostly much later films than *Divorce*. In this film	 he is disarmed of his pomp and overconfidence by sassy Merle Oberon	 and plays the flustered divorce attorney with great charm."	1.0
"The premise of the movie has been explained and if you've gotten this far you don't me to pretend that I'm a movie critic. With that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with DOA 2 and 3	 and some others (many).<br /><br />The movie seems to get a free pass because it is a Takashi film and nothing Takashi does can be wrong. This is a highschoolers approach to cinema. For the rest of us we'll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying (and yes	 this does take away from the film)	 the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis	 and the acting...well...hmmm. <br /><br />If one is a Takashi fan you'll see it regardless to peak your interests. It lacks any originality (see the Neverending Story) or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one. <br /><br />As it has been pointed out this is the first film Miike has been credited with co-writing	 but that doesn't mean much as non of what we'd hope would be Miike's personality would spill over into the screen. All we get are some of the token Miike shots vis the director of photography.<br /><br />The movie had the potential to be something great. The premise is not a difficult one to run wild with. But this one seemed to have been run into the ground.<br /><br />My suggestion is if you're just getting into Miike is go with some of the standards like Gozu	 Ichi	 and Audition. Then movie into his works like Blue's Harp	 Fudoh	 Rainy Dog	 Bird People of China."	0.0
"I'd really	 really wanted to see this movie	 and waited for months to get it through our Blockbuster Total Access account. When it showed up in our mailbox	 I threw it straight into the DVD player.<br /><br />I was very sadly disappointed	 which in turn made me mad. I'll give any movie a chance	 even if I want to walk out of the theater/press 'stop'. I watched it all the way through	 but didn't get anything from it but frustration.<br /><br />The acting was very	 very good	 but that was about it. Nothing is explained; while we understand that Mathieu becomes depressed and lands in a psych ward of some kind	 we're never given insight to his 'downfall'. While we understand that he and Cedric break up	 again	 we don't see it happen or WHY it happened. During an interview with Mathieu's doctor	 Cedric reveals that he'd cheated on him once	 but it was no big deal. I expected to see this in flashbacks	 but no--nothing. We also gets the hints that Cedric was the one to bring Mat to the hospital--but AGAIN	 we don't see it.<br /><br />I know some movies are a 'take it as it is' basis	 but this movie honestly ticked me off. When Pierre	 Cedric's ex shows up in the club and starts trouble	 we don't see hide nor hair of him until near the end	 and it took me a good chunk of time to figure out that Pierre WAS the ex. His personality at the club and when Mat finds him are entirely different. I might even be wrong saying this	 it was that confusing.<br /><br />The film expects you to know everything and move along with its disjointed	 out-of-place and confusing pace. I can keep up with films like 'Pi'	 'Citizen Kane' and other films that have flashbacks/flash-forwards left and right	 but CU didn't capture and hold onto the style. At the end of 'Citizen Kane'	 you know what's going on and discover the answer to the main mysteries. CU just leaves you hanging. It has an air of pretension in its 'we're not gonna tell you a damned thing	 figure it out for yourself' presentation. It's like reading a book with the chapters switched around and pages missing.<br /><br />Good acting	 like I said. I liked the characters	 but the whole story was just too disappointing."	0.0
"Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a cultural gadfly whose previous films laid bare some the artistic excess of the Sixties and the hollow avaricious Eighties. With ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" she points her unswerving eye at Fifties America	 an era cloaked in the moral righteousness of Joe McCarthy	 while experiencing the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade. Harron and her co-writer Guinevere Turner	 are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol. This is a film about the underground icon of an era and how her pure unashamed sexuality revealed both the predatory instincts and impure thoughts of a culture untouched by the beauty of a nude body. If the details of Bettie's life were all the film was concerned about	 then why end it before her most tragic period was about to begin. Clearly	 Harron is more interested in America's attitudes towards sexual imagery then and now. Together with a fearless lead performance by Gretchen Mol and the stunningly atmospheric cinematography of W.Mott Hupfel III	 she accomplishes this goal admirably	 holding up a mirror to the past while making the audience examine their own ""enlightened"" 21st Century attitudes towards so-called pornography. As America suffocates under a new conservatism	 this is a film needed more than ever."	1.0
"At the start	 this one is from England	 so	 of course	 I had 98 % chances that it will be intelligent and very good cinema. I never heard of this film before. From the minute I saw Helena Bonham-Carter	 I said to myself : Oh! Here's comes the feminine version of My Left Foot. I was right	 but I was also wrong. Wrong because the two movies are very differents. My Left Foot was a John Ford alike movie and this one is a Chaplin alike movie (not because this is funny	 but Chaplin at that great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes.) I was right because in 1990 handsome Daniel Day-Lewis turn a little bit ugly by playing an crippled person and he did it with a great sense of reality. Here	 very beautiful Bonham-Carter did exactly the same thing	 but with very feminine emotions. The story is well written and it's very intelligent. For me	 miss Bonham-Carter gives one of the greatest woman's part of the 1990's	 with Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Waves. Gee! And look at her eyes! She had the most beautiful eyes of cinema since Jobyna Ralston	 Louise Brooks	 Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner! She's also a true talent	 as seen on many other movies. See this one	 you won't regret it! And a very fine job by Branagh too!"	1.0
"The story of Cinderella is one of my favorites from Charles Perrault	 with Sleeping Beauty which was also made into a Disney film in 1959; this film is a sweet	 enchanting masterpiece from Disney.<br /><br />The film has a great soundtrack; that's one I like in a movie is a very good soundtrack	 and I love the songs too; my favorite song is the romantic ""So This is Love."" I love the mice from the film too	 they are cute. My favorite scene is the scene after the narration	 the little birds tried to wake Cinderella up in the morning; I also love it when Cinderella's animal friends (the mice and birds) fix up Cinderella's birth-mother's dress	 so she could go to the ball...until Drizella & Anastasia tore it to bits	 the b****es!"	1.0
"Listen	 I don't care what anybody says	 as Cypher is nothing less than a 5 star movie. Cypher is not	 I repeat not	 a B movie. Cypher is an absolute masterpiece. Suffice it to say	 I am a connoisseur of the world's finest spy films and this film is nothing less than top flight. I cannot overemphasis how phenomenal this movie is. Cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and ever made. The technology in this movie is over the horizon of spacetime. In fact	 I must admit that Cypher completely surprised the hell out of me. In fact	 I've recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie. Other critics	 of whom some downplayed the movie	 have no idea as to what the hell they're talking about. Don't listen to the haters. And actually	 for the most part	 reviews of Cypher have been largely positive. And it should be noted that Cyher is not only a good movie	 but it is also a fantastic movie. Cypher is the kind of movie that's so advanced and so magnificently crafted	 that it's over the heads of most critics and all the cynics. There is nothing wrong with or cheap about Cypher whatsoever. Again	 the cinematography	 the backdrops	 the technology	 the storyline	 and the acting are all 100% world-class top notch. Naturally	 I won't give anything away. This is not a spoiler. And though it is the contention of some critics that Cypher should have been in movie theaters	 I believe quite the opposite. Cypher is a movie that seems to have been just right for DVD release only and not in a bad way. Cypher has got to be the greatest underground spy flick ever to hit the shelves. Blade Runner	 1984	 Brave New World	 Total Recall	 Logan's Run	 Jason Bourne and Impostor and Deja Vu... look out! Cypher equally earns the distinction of being placed in the AONN Multimedia Research	 5 Star Eternal Spy Movie Hall of Fame. Cypher is counterespionage at it's absolute best. Hands down and hats off. Nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction. The future is now."	1.0
"Sondra Locke stinks in this film	 but then she was an awful 'actress' anyway. Unfortunately	 she drags everyone else (including then =real life boyfriend Clint Eastwood down the drain with her. But what was Clint Eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one? One read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer. It's an exceptionally weak story	 basically no story or plot at all. Add in bored	 poor acting	 even from the normally good Eastwood. There's absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as I was concerned	 this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers. Wow! Could a film BE any more boring? I think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun. A real stinker. Don't bother with this one."	0.0
"Trying to conceive of something as insipid as THE SENTINEL would be pretty difficult. The problems are many. The result is terrible and loaded with plot holes.<br /><br />Michael Douglas stars as Pete Garrison	 a Secret Service agent who ""took one"" for Reagan during the attempt on his life. Years later we find Pete assigned to the Whitehouse Family	 mainly as a guard for the First Lady (Kim Basinger	 L.A. CONFIDENTIAL). Troubles arise as we see Pete's close involvement with the First Lady	 and a sudden threat against the President himself (David Rasche	 UNITED 93). When Pete fails a polygraph test	 he's singled out as a disgruntled agent by investigator David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland	 24 TV series).<br /><br />As the presidential assassination plot unfolds	 Pete finds himself on the run from his own people. His only confidant is the First Lady	 and she's reluctant to tell anyone about their affections for one another (which is why Pete failed the polygraph in the first place). But is Pete really innocent? Or is he simply trying to buy time until he can kill the President? If he is innocent	 how can he help prevent the assassination attempt while running from the Secret Service? <br /><br />The one	 big	 overwhelming problem with this film is that there's no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat. Isn't that what the movie's supposed to be about? One would think so! But the audience is never let in on why the assassin(s) want to kill the Prez. Hmm. Someone forget to put that in the script somewhere? <br /><br />And what's with David Breckinridge's (Kiefer's) new partner	 Jill Marin (Eva Longoria	 CARLITA'S WAY)? Seems that she was put in the film strictly as a piece of a$$-candy. What was her purpose again? Did she do anything other than look nice in tight pants and a low-cut blouse?<br /><br />There are so many problems with the basic premise of The Sentinel as to be laughable. The action is too easily stymied by the ""What the...?"" responses sure to be uttered by those unfortunate enough to watch the movie."	0.0

I can't make myself watch this pile of crap after the dream boxing match/insult war	 where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain. You would think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous	 but after watching this you'll know its true. This movie isn't worth the price I paid for it. I've watched a ton of Steven segal movies	 and I've even watched Crossroads twice... but I still couldn't watch this."	0.0
"Everyone does things that they later regret. Things that they wish they could blame on drugs or alien possession. Things that although seem rational at the time	 later reveal themselves to be engraved invitations for suffering and endless recriminations of stupidity.<br /><br />For some people it is signing the note for the new Hummer	 for others it is picking up a homicidal hitchhiker	 for still others it is sending their bank account information to third world millionaires mysteriously strapped for cash.<br /><br />For me it was a film.<br /><br />D-War: Dragon Wars In hindsight	 I should have guessed how environmentally friendly and thoroughly recycled this movie would turn out to be from its stuttered and repeating title. But with my willing suspension of disbelief intact	 and a naive faith stemming from the cool looking poster in the lobby	 I really wanted this film to work. Sadly	 by the time the old man in the pawnshop explained the entire backstory	 fifteen minutes into the picture	 I had the sudden	 sinking revelation that comes from knowing every plot point of a still unseen film. And worse: I knew just how badly every point would all suck.<br /><br />Let me be perfectly clear here	 the English language lacks sufficient nuance and depth in the field of ultimate evil to properly describe just how bad this film really is.<br /><br />As for knowing all the twists of movie	 I was wrong. In the spirit of the old Godzilla films	 whose scales this one is not worthy to fill	 it conveniently sprouted extra sub-plots every time the main characters were threatened by the specter of meaningful dialogue.<br /><br />It was infested with close calls	 miraculous escapes	 and concentrated deposits of poorly explained angst.<br /><br />This film is what would happen if you gave the produces of the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers access to the national defense budget. And lots of liquor.<br /><br />Let me try to explain.<br /><br />Imagine you could get a hold of all the coolest-looking set pieces from successful action movies of the last decade: First take the rasta-talking army of amphibians from Star Wars Episode One and remove their Prozac until they are ready to club Navy Seals.<br /><br />Next	 take close approximations of Kira Knightly and Tom Cruise (You can even call him Ethan as a ""subtle"" nod to the Mission Impossible franchise.) and give them lots of film noir narration	 so no one get confused while trying to follow the wading-pool depths of their thoughts.<br /><br />Finally add a raspy-voiced villain in pointy armor worthy of a Lord of the Rings yardsale and a couple of giant cobras	 angry at having their scenes deleted from latest edition of King Kong	 and lay them all out in no particular order in modern day Los Angeles.<br /><br />Now run to the drugstore to find something for your sudden migraine. When you return	 puree these ingredients until any overlooked hint of originality is dissolved into a homogenized mass of cheese and serve semi-gelatinous.<br /><br />At several points during this picture	 I found myself saying out loud	 ""Make the bad movie stop	"" and breaking into tears.<br /><br />To call this a B-movie would be giving it an undeserved promotion. After summer school	 and a lot of physical therapy	 it might possibly pass for a C level film if you could somehow sleep through most of it.<br /><br />In short	 if you ever find yourself with money and brain cells to burn	 and the need to punish yourself for hideous	 unspoken sins against humanity	 Dragon Wars might just be the film for you."	0.0
"French horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as Inside and Switchblade Romance bursting on to the scene. Maléfique preceded the revival just slightly	 but stands head and shoulders over most modern horror titles and is surely one of the best French horror films ever made! Maléfique was obviously shot on a low budget	 but this is made up for in far more ways than one by the originality of the film	 and this in turn is complimented by the excellent writing and acting that ensure the film is a winner. The plot focuses on two main ideas; prison and black magic. The central character is a man named Carrère	 sent to prison for fraud. He is put in a cell with three others; the quietly insane Lassalle	 body building transvestite Marcus and his retarded boyfriend Daisy. After a short while in the cell together	 they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal. After translating part of it	 they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison walls.<br /><br />Black Magic is a very interesting topic	 and I'm actually quite surprised that there aren't more films based on it as there's so much scope for things to do with it. It's fair to say that Maléfique makes the best of it's assets as despite it's restraints	 the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout. Director Eric Valette provides a great atmosphere for the film; the fact that most of it takes place inside the central prison cell ensures that the film feels very claustrophobic	 and this immensely benefits the central idea of the prisoners wanting to use magic to break out of the cell - it's very easy to get behind them! It's often said that the unknown is the thing that really frightens people	 and this film proves that as the director ensures that we can never really be sure of exactly what is round the corner	 and this helps to ensure that Maléfique actually does manage to be quite frightening! The film is memorable for a lot of reasons outside the central plot; the characters are all very interesting in their own way and the fact that the book itself almost takes on its own character is very well done. Anyone worried that the film won't deliver by the end won't be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying! Overall	 Maléfique is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade - HIGHLY recommended viewing!"	1.0

"OK	 forget all the technical inconsisties or the physical impossibilities of the Space Shuttle accidentally being launched by a quirky robot with a heart of gold.

The story is horrible. The acting is comical and the message its trying to show is incomprehensible. And whats worse	 is that the cable Movie channels KEEP SHOWING IT!

"This comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail. There have been many films of this genre with more notable actors attempting to achieve this elusive mixture which haven't come anywhere near the depth and deftness of this one. This is surely because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters rapidly grip your interest and emotions and hold them throughout the film. At first	 the action seems rather off-the-wall and harebrained but one gradually learns that these two rather pathetic damaged people are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves	 even if grudgingly	 through each other. Rogers' heartrending facial expressions of numb hurt and Sheedy's angry outbursts are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them. You will care about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it's in doubt and all hangs on a tenuous emotional thread. Hopefully audiences will get to see more of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy as this film proves their merit as very accomplished actors beyond doubt."	1.0

However	 I did like Jared Harris' performance of John Lennon which was worth the wasted 2 hours."	0.0
"I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from a Comedy	 Drama	 Fantasy	 Sci-Fi genre	 but	 given the actors involved I thought I'd give it a spin. The tone of the film felt awkward	 going through patches of each of the genres but never quite felt balanced	 so eventually I gave up trying	 and concentrated on the cinematography and individual performances	 which I thought were good on the whole	 considering each character had little depth because of the nature of the story (won't give anything away here). I have to say it felt a LOT longer than its 96 minute runtime	 and not in a good way. In the end I was looking for closure	 some measure of satisfaction but it didn't turn out to be the clever or ingenious piece I had hoped it would be. I think Tony mistakenly thought what he did do at the end of the film gave us that... but it was a tragic mistake to try and validate the previous 95 minutes with the ill-conceived conclusion. Ultimately I feel cheated. IMO it would have been better to let it stand without the ""ending"" as a piece of Art... just. Or... I may have missed the point completely :)"	0.0
"tom had a wish to make film for a long time and he did. it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn out notebook full of great little ideas he has been filling up and carrying around for 10 years. no grant character transformations	 no Hollywood ingredients just life and a little bit of magic. the balance	 in speed	 in weirdness in comedy vs drama is perfectly weighed. this film takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how nice it was. the music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied. the fact that this film is about nothing	 merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the characters	 makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining	 it is brilliant because it is empty. in between the lines it is happening. to see or not to see	 that's the ?"	1.0
"Gerard is a writer with a somewhat overactive imagination. He is also homosexual and Catholic prone to Catholic guilt and something of a clairvoyant	 or so it seems. On a trip to Flushing he is 'seduced' by Christine. When he discovers that Christine's new boyfriend is the bit of rough trade he's been fancying from afar he decides to stick around. After all	 enforced heterosexuality has its compensations. Then he realizes that Christine's previous three husbands have all died violent deaths. Did Christine murder them and is he or the boyfriend	 Herman	 going to be 'the fourth man'? Verhoeven's overheated	 over-egged melodrama is a delicious blend of Hitchcock and David Lynch	 full of OTT eroticism and religious imagery and an awful lot of the colour red. A lot of the time it looks and feels like a dream and we can never be sure that what we are seeing is real or a figment of Gerard's imagination. The fun is in figuring it out. Also the fact that Christine is an infinitely more likable character that either the priggish Gerard or the bullish Herman means we are hardly like to root for either of the men over her. In fact	 it's fair to say Gerard's comeuppance can't come soon enough. Super performances	 too	 from Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and easily Verhoeven's best film up to his wonderfully subversive piece of sci-fi ""Starship Troopers""."	1.0
"I watched this movie alongwith my complete family of Nine. Since my younger brother has recently got married	 we could connect with the goings-on. The movie stands out for the classical touch given to the romance of the engaged couple. Thankfully this time all Indian locales like Ranikhet Almora etc have been used	 which have been already visited by most of the urbanites	 hence adding to the connection with movie. The dialogues are much better than those in the ""Umrao Jaan Ada"" - a supposedly dialogue based movie. The background music is augmenting the ""soft focus"" of the movie. It somehow remind me of VV Chopra's ""Kareeb""	 in which neha and to some extent Bobby did full justice to the character. Same here	 in that the lead pair does not disappoint in any department-looks or acting. The Supporting cast are too good. I rate the actress playing the role of Bhabhi in the front league. The situations of family interactions portrayed are real and you smile when you find yourself in place of one of the characters. Songs were too suiting the scenes and going along well with the movie. However	 though I respect Ravindra Jain for his body of work from movies to Ramayana	 I missed Ram Laxman badly.<br /><br />It had no double entendres(Sivan category)	 no bikinis	 no intrigue	 and no nonsense. You would comfortably watch the movie with your parents except if you're already or going to be soon engaged. I want to express on candid thing here that though Suraj proposes that the marriages is between families and not only individuals	 his approach is totally individualistic. The movie is only about Prem & Poonam	 rest of the characters are incidental. Art immitating life? The ""peripheral characters"" are consigned to the background and the only protagonists are the lead pair. <br /><br />Coming back	 Everything was almost great. Except	 for the drama part. The situation of tragedy was artificially created. The outcome	 the sacrifice and the ensuing heart change are not compelling at all. That is why it lacks the emotional punch-the very purpose of this turn of events. But	 a twist in the tale was necessary to transcend the movie from a beautiful pre-marital video to a 'feature film'. But I kept waiting for the punch and it never came. The preaching by Mohnish Bahal and later by Alok Nath on dowry was out of place and it made things too overboard. May be this will help the movie a tax-free status. But the plot could have been made more interesting and non-linear than what it was.<br /><br />There were too question in my mind when the movie ended: 1 Has the movie really ended? 2 Has the movie ended?"	1.0
"This three stooges flick is at a tie with my other favorite flick ""Disorder in the Court"". This is an uproar of laughter for any Three Stooges fan to enjoy.<br /><br />The boys are janitors at a recording studio when they hear the lovely Christine McIntyre sings a great version of ""Voices of Spring"". She is going to be offered a record deal	 but she is scarred to be honest with her father about her choice of a career and prove herself as a real singer. When she and the others leave the studio	 the stooges decide to have a little fun and play her record and dress Curly up as Christine. The contract lady who can make Christine's career	 sees Curly and mistakes him for Christine and invites Curly to sing for her party. Of course there is a man that they have upset that is at the party and they destroy his solo in front of the crowd	 so he'll find a way to get back at them.<br /><br />What a great stooge flick	 this should not be missed! <br /><br />10/10"	1.0
"I saw the trailer of the film several times at theater and I excited. It looked like a classic action thriller like the ones made in 1990's. It recalled me also Fugitive movies	 a cat and mouse chase between Douglas and Sutherland. However	 The Sentinel is the most tasteless action thriller of all time. As I see	 many people say that this is like a TV movie. Not exactly. Firstly	 there are much more better TV movies in this genre. Secondly	 TV movies might be very fun sometimes	 but this film is the exact opposite of having a good time. It is not stylish at all visually and the most important	 the tone of the movie is unappealing. This is not an action movie	 there are two action scenes consist of a chase and a clash. Also they are not big action scenes	 but the worse is that those action scenes are very tasteless like the whole movie. The love affair between Douglas and Bassinger was very unnecessary. Besides	 the assassination plot to the president is the most cliché story in this genre either	 but they insist on that. And this is not a cat and mouse film as it is supposed to be. Although	 Douglas is very old now	 he has still potential for acting in an action thriller. In the film	 Michael Douglas cannot be like Tommy Lee Jones	 for example. Sutherland is a wrong choice either	 because you feel as if you watch Jack Bauer and somehow	 its character is one of the reasons which make the film like a TV movie	 Eva Longoria Parker is a strange choice	 of course she is too passive or straight in this movie	 because she is a soap opera actress. The movie was not fun even one second to me	 so I could not get over for a while."	0.0
"East Palace	 West Palace reminded me somewhat of The Detective	 with Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop	 and William Windom is the boy. It's a progressive film for China	 I guess	 but it also perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men: much is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles. The movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy. He cruises the park without fear--he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer. And that in fact happens. Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture: made to squat for a period of time	 handcuffed	 slapped. This is what the gay man wants	 and	 implicitly	 the gay man is challenging the cop's self-image as a manly man. The story's about the gay man's life (which include flashbacks) are tolerable	 but when he starts describing old Chinese myths and dramatic works	 the movie becomes unbearable. It becomes a cry of pity for China's gays	 who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry	 I can't relate."	0.0
"In 1454	 in France	 the sorcerer Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) is decapitated and his mistress Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) is tortured to death accused of witchcraft	 vampirism and lycanthropy. Before they die	 they curse the next generations of their executioners. In the present days (in the 70's)	 Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) go to a séance session	 where they evoke the spirit of Alaric de Marnac. They decide to travel to the Villas de Sade	 a real estate of Hugo's family in the countryside	 to seek a monastery with a hidden treasure. They find Alaric's head and the fiend possesses them	 bringing Mabille back to life and executing the locals in gore sacrifices. After the death of her father	 Elvira (Emma Cohen) recalls that he has the Thor's Hammer amulet hidden in a well; together with Maurice	 they try to defeat the demoniac Alaric de Marnac and Mabille.<br /><br />Last weekend I bought a box of horror genre with five DVDs of Paul Naschy per US$ 9.98; despite of having no references	 I decided to take the chance. The first DVD with the uncut and restored version ""Horror Rises from the Tomb"" is a trash B (or C) movie that immediately made me recall Ed Wood. The ridiculous story is disclosed through awful screenplay	 direction	 performances	 cinematography	 decoration	 special effects and edition and with lots of naked women. The result is simply hilarious and I can guarantee that Ed Wood's style is back. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Not Available"	0.0
"The magnetism radiated from Elvira	 drawing her legions of devoted admirers	 has a primordial quality. With her lengthy	 well-toned figure	 large-bust	 innocuously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang	 the character of Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal. As an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling	 it is evident that the Elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one-liners and large chest. As initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her	 she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic yearning	 boyish sexual craving and the desire for non-threateningly lighthearted fun. She symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town. The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons. In the end	 however	 her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting	 her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents. Nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy	 only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense. Fortunately	 I have such ability and found the film to be a delightful charmer.<br /><br />Best Quote: Bob Redding: How's your head? Elvira: I haven't had any complaints."	1.0
"As a rule	 a Full Moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid a film. But because I've enjoyed Jeffrey Combs in other films	 I gave it a shot.<br /><br />It's not bad. Not great	 but that's something else. The film involves a struggle with a mystic (evil) ""brother"" who wants to dominate the worlds	 and the title character. Dr. Mordrid also has to deal with people	 and authorities in the mundane world	 which he does successfully.<br /><br />Possible spoilers follow.<br /><br />Dr. Mordrid can travel between ""dimensions	"" and does so to find a companion guarding a fortress; however	 the guard has been blinded. His eyes are ruined pits. So the wizard passes his hands across the other's eyes	 and hey	 presto! His eyes have been restored! This sort of healing apparently only works with eyes.<br /><br />Later	 Mordred and his ""brother"" animate a couple of animal skeletons in a museum to fight. Guess which one wins.<br /><br />However	 side from that	 the picture isn't at all bad	 though much like a comic book. Dr. Mordred's more ""human"" adventures are okay	 and Combs plays the role convincingly.<br /><br />I've seen lots worse."	1.0
"This movie was a mess. It had the absolute worst editing I have ever seen. It was almost like at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial	 and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the writers dream.<br /><br />Under the messy direction and editing	 there was a glimmer of something good. A good idea	 a compelling spark. But somewhere it went wrong.<br /><br />The story is about a quasi-psychic priest who is trying to solve a string of murders. The first thing that is hard to bite into is Richard Grieco as a priest. Well the part doesn't call for him to be a good priest and he succeeds rather well. The second problem is Dennis Hopper as the crazy bad guy. He always plays the crazy bad guy. Very ho hum.<br /><br />Oh	 a thought occured to me that maybe all the jumpy	 horrible editing and disconnected plot was trying to add a sense of the confusion the character (Grieco) was experiencing. And just to prove that it was contrived they rolled the credits backwords. Not a good sign for any movie.<br /><br />"	0.0
"Being born in the 1960's I grew up watching the TV ""Movies of the Week"" in the early 70's and loved the creepy movies that were routinely shown including ""Crowhaven Farm""	 ""Bad Ronald""	 ""Satan's School for Girls""	 ""Kolchak the Night Stalker""	 etc	 but this one is just plain dumb.This is obviously the writer's trying to capitalize on the horrific Manson murders from a few years earlier. The movie stars Dennis Weaver of ""McCloud"" and ""Duel"" fame as a father who takes his family camping on a beach. The family encounters some hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family. The reason for this is never explained	 and Weaver's pacifistic stance is hard to swallow. For God's sake	 call the police	 beat the hell of them or something	 just don't sit there and whine about it. The acting is pretty lame	 the story unbelievable	 etc. Susan Dey looks cute in a bikini but that's about it. Ignore this if it ever airs on TV."	0.0
"A great film this	 and a shame that it will receive little attention outside of arthouse circles and students who stay up until two in the morning to watch it on Channel Four.<br /><br />The plot is a simple one but works very effectively	 the blurring between child-like fantasy and hard-hitting nightmare is very well blurred. The budget looks pretty low	 but to the credit of those involved it doesn't show too often. It also hasn't dated that much either.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to tape this off the telly when it was on a few years ago	 and it has withstood half-a-dozen viewings. It's one of those films that won't appeal to all; though as usual	 those with a more thoughtful approach to cinema would get a lot out of this.<br /><br />Charlotte Buerke puts in a good performance as Anna	 the spoilt brat and it is a shame she seems to have gone from the acting scene. Cross is also very good	 carrying the stature of his character very well within the context of the picture.<br /><br />There are some genuinely (and I don't say that lightly) disturbing moments in this film	 both half-second shockers and more drawn-out tensions. Watch it with the lights out!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />"	1.0
"Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga	 which finally ended in 2005	 I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series. The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut	 furry woodland creatures	 etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.<br /><br />None of the action ever focused too long in one spot	 either. The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.<br /><br />Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally	 everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see.<br /><br />In the end	 this was simply a wonderful adventure tale	 more than anything else."	1.0
"A seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating. The premise seems simple enough: Yentl	 a girl interested in studying the Talmud	 wants to go to school. But only boys are allowed to study	 so after her father's death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in. She does and becomes close friends with Avigdor	 who is to be married to a beautiful woman named Hadass. Hadass' family learns Avigdor's brother committed suicide	 and the wedding is called off. Yentl	 now calling herself Anschel	 is then selected to marry Hadass. She does but it is never consummated. Yentl/Anschel and Avigdor go away for a few days	 and Yentl/Anschel reveals her secret to him. The movie ends with Avigdor returning to (and marrying?) Hadass	 and Yentl going to America to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise.<br /><br />The plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over 2 hours long	 but there are several things that ruin it. For starters	 there is the constant SINGING. (I can already hear the critics shouting.) Yes	 I know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers. But the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them. The songs become tedious after a while	 and there isn't as much dancing as one would expect. Many of the songs are forgettable	 with no real memorable lyrics	 and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voice-over. Only one song stands out from the rest	 ""Papa Can You Hear Me"". It is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so Streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes. Chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is	 so the songs really aren't necessary. <br /><br />Second	 Streisand's makeup	 which can be seen during her scenes as a man (the lipstick	 enhanced lashes	 and traces of blush are all obvious) makes it hard for the audience to believe in the Yentl/Anschel character	 that she is actually serious	 and fooling her new friends	 colleagues	 and even Hadass	 into believing she is a man. Yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing. There seems to be a contradiction	 as her character talks	 or rather sings	 of how she doesn't think she can pull it off	 but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men's clothing. This means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they can't see the other differences	 such as her actions	 which are clear giveaways. The facial differences alone cannot be included	 as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives or friends didn't have a beard or other facial hair. Nevertheless	 in the 1900s	 if a woman dressed as a man	 but wore as much makeup as Streisand's character did	 and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore men's clothing	 it would have been deemed unacceptable and caused an outrage. Chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town	 or even the country. Therefore the ""feminine"" makeup on Streisand does not lend to the character's credibility	 and only weakens the plot. If it was only applied to make Streisand look more beautiful	 it should have been scrapped. <br /><br />Thirdly	 when Yentl/Anschel herself reveals who she truly is toward the end	 we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as Streisand's and only when they learn the ""truth"" do they become a little wiser. By now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a custom-made vehicle for Streisand to fuel.<br /><br />Lastly	 there are those who are fans of Streisand who will find no fault with this film	 its plot	 or the songs. To those I must respectfully disagree. While she has excellent vocal and acting abilities	 I am not a ""fan"" of her style of singing. However	 I have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals. There are even some songs of hers that I like	 so I am not a ""hater"" nor have set out to bash her. I have written this review from an honest perspective	 from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie - several times even - and has noted the problems within. If Streisand was interested in creating a great or even believable film	 she could have done so here by not injecting her need to show off and prove how talented	 beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn. This movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities	 make her appear self-absorbed	 and thus turn the film into a laugh-fest unworthy of her fans or audience."	0.0
"Gorgeous Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast	 a television reporter who travels with her crew (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) to Solvang	 California	 to cover a Danish festival. The problem is that their accommodations have fallen through and all hotels in town are full. So they travel out of town to a remote location and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly Ernest Keller (a phenomenal Sydney Lassick). Wouldn't you know it	 Ernest and meek partner Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) are hiding a big secret in their cellar: pitiable	 deformed	 diaper-clad ""Junior"" (Stephen Furst	 in a remarkable performance) who ultimately terrorizes the girls.<br /><br />A deliciously unhinged Lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie. It builds slowly but surely to an intense confrontation / climax	 delivering the horror in small doses until the final half hour. The hotel and the foreboding cellar - large echoes of ""Psycho"" here - are great settings. Most of all	 the perverse plot involves incest and patricide	 allowing the movie to take on a truly dark quality. And yet it also becomes poignant as we realize Junior is no one-dimensionally evil bogeyman but as much a victim as the girls. The final shot is especially sad.<br /><br />""The Unseen"" is a solid little horror flick worthy of discovery.<br /><br />8/10"	1.0
"No	 there is another !<br /><br />Because every Star Wars fan had to have an opinion about I	 II & III and because that opinion was biased since we missed so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy	 I will state the good points of ""The Return of the Jedi"" and a few corresponding bad points of the prequel. Of course	 I loved the music	 the special effects	 the two droids	 but this has been overly debated elsewhere.<br /><br />What we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie : - A strong ecological concern - Anti-militarist positions - Fascinating insights about the Jedi Order and the Force - Cute creatures - Harrison Ford's smile - A killer scene : Near the ending	 when Vader looks alternatively at his son and at the Emperor. The lightning of the lethal bolts reflected on his Black helmet. And when he grabs and betrays his Master to save Luke	 thereby risking his own life ! Oh	 boy !<br /><br />What is wrong in the prequel INMHO : - the whole ""human factor"" element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing - The Force seems to be more about superpowers and somersaults	 than about wisdom - Too many Jedis at once and too many Light Sabers on the screen - The lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the coherence of the plot <br /><br />By the way	 if you enjoy the theory of the Force as explained by Obi Web (Obi Wen	 I mean) and Yoda	 then you should read a few books about Buddhism and the forms it took in Ancient Japan.<br /><br />The magic of Star Wars	 IMHO lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage from a master to his apprentice	 from a father to his son	 albeit the difficulties. ""De mon âme à ton âme""	 (from my soul to yours)	 as would write Bejard to the late Zen master T. Deshimaru."	1.0
"Roman Polanski has made many	 many movies that are unexceptional. His fame bewilders me. Nothing stands out as a high point except Chinatown (I haven't seen 'Knife in the Water' or 'Tess'). Any contribution he's made to film concluded more than twenty years ago; his work is just embarrassing	 safe and/or dull (The Pianist	 Frantic	 Oliver Twist	 The Ninth Gate	 Pirates).<br /><br />R's Baby must have signified the end of the establishment at the time it came out. It's lux-produced and fairly high concept for a 1968 'horror' movie (never show the baby). But this is just misconceived horror sap. Everything is arty to the point that the plot line becomes hopelessly clear very early (Um	 thanks for that finale-destroying title)	 and on a clear day you can see the twist ending coming for days. It did not sustain my interest. I find that whatever this movie might have been	 it is utterly derailed by the 1960's version of what femininity was. Farrow is such a chronic distracted	 helpless waif/housewife. Her frailty is oversold... she's irritating in the extreme. There's no real ideas in it... nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil.<br /><br />The Dakota is barely exploited for it eerie potential."	0.0

Sometimes horror movies are awesome because they are so stupid	 but this was just sad."	0.0
"That's the sound of Stan and Ollie spinning in their graves.<br /><br />I won't bother listing the fundamental flaws of this movie as they're so obvious they go without saying. Small things	 like this being ""The All New Adventures of Laurel and Hardy"" despite the stars being dead for over thirty years when it was made. Little things like that. <br /><br />A bad idea would be to have actors playing buffoons whom just happen to be called Laurel and Hardy. As bad as that is	 it might have worked. For a really bad idea	 try casting two actors to impersonate the duo. Okay	 they might claim to be nephews	 but the end result is the same.<br /><br />Bronson Pinchot can be funny. Okay	 forget his wacky foreigner ""Cousin Larry"" schtick in Perfect Strangers	 and look at him in True Romance. Here though	 he stinks. It's probably not all his fault	 and	 like the director and the support cast - all of who are better than the material - he was probably just desperate for money. There are those who claim Americans find it difficult to master an effective English accent. This cause is not helped here by Pinchot. What is Stan? Welsh? Iranian? Pakistani? Only in Stan's trademark yelp does he come close	 though as the yelp is overdone to the point of tedium that's nothing to write home about. Gailard Sartain does slightly better as Ollie	 though it's like saying what's worse - stepping in dog dirt or a kick in the knackers? <br /><br />Remember the originals with their split-second timing	 intuitive teamwork and innate loveability? Well that's absent altogether	 replaced with two stupid old men and jokes so mistimed you could park a bus through the gaps. Whereas the originals had plots that could be summed up in a couple of panels	 this one has some long-winded Mummy hokum (and what a lousy title!) that's mixed in with the boys' fraternity scenario. I can't claim to have seen every single one of Laurel and Hardy's 108 movies	 but I think it's a safe bet that even their nadir was leagues ahead of this.<br /><br />Maybe the major problem is that the originals were sort-of playing themselves	 or at least using their own accents. It at least felt natural and unforced	 as opposed to the contrived caricatures Pinchot and Sartain are given. And since when did Stan do malapropisms	 and so many at that? ""I was gonna give you a standing cremation""; ""I would like to marinate my friend."" Stop it! <br /><br />Only notable moment is a reference to Bozo the Clown	 the cartoon character who shared Larry Harmon's L & H comic. Harmon of course bought the name copyright (how disconcerting to see a ® after Laurel and Hardy) and was co-director and producer of this travesty. <br /><br />Questions abound. Would Stan and Ollie do fart gags if they were alive today? Would they glass mummies with broken bottles? Have Stan being smacked in the genitals with a spear and end on a big CGI-finale? Let's hope not.<br /><br />I did laugh once	 but I think that was just in disbelief at how terrible it all is. Why was this film made in the first place? Who did the makers think would like it? Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen	 an absolute abhorrence I grew sick of watching after just the first five minutes. About as much fun as having your head trapped in a vice while a red-hot poker and stinging nettles are forcibly inserted up your back passage."	0.0
"i would like to comment the series as a great effort. The story line although requiring a few improvements was pretty well	 especially in season 1. Season 2 however became more of a freak show	 and lost DA's original charm. Season one story line was more interesting	 a light side to the life at Jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing down the X-series. i was looking forward to new seasons	 in fact i still am. I hope the FOX guys and DA production crew realize that a lot of ppl still wait for DA to make a comeback. Even after 2 yrs of it being cancelled	 DA can make it big if worked on properly	 and i think a name like James Cameron should take on this challenge."	1.0
"As far as I can understand	 TIW WATCHER is the first work of a young director. My doubt is if this is the work of a regular guy who happens to love films or if this is the work of a cinema student	 since there is a reference to Oporto School of Arts in the final credits.<br /><br />Nevertheless	 director Ricardo Pinho demonstrates with this movie a total unawareness of some basic notions about cinema. What is a movie? How to tell a story? It doesn't matter	 for the novice director. One of the first things you learn in school when you're studying cinema is how to tell a story. You learn that	 just like in novels	 in movies you should also construct your story in three acts: the introduction	 the development and the conclusion. You learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax. You learn this is valid for a 3-hour-epic	 for the regular movie	 for a short film and even	 believe it or not	 for a 30-second commercial. You also learn there can be levels of subtleness in your approach to the academic structure and that	 ultimately	 you can even deconstruct it.<br /><br />In rough terms	 TIM WATCHER introduces us its main character and then	 the movie ends - the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in Jeunet's AMÉLIE. There are no second or third acts in TIM WATCHER. This is not a parody or an art film	 thus you can't even try to justify the disrespect for the academic structure. You are expecting to be told a story	 and it doesn't happen. Worst than that	 TIM WATCHER defines itself as a warning; and one with no real purpose. It doesn't make a point	 or at least	 not a valid one. Its point is childish	 with a sense of vengeance. The situations portrayed are utterly simple and its approach is Manichaean.<br /><br />I was expecting a lot more from this short. The movie opens with a rather good-looking credits sequence and you quickly realize you are watching something with better production values than the regular Portuguese short film. I don't know the budget for this movie	 but judging for the thanks-list in the end credits	 merit must go to the production team for such good connections in a country where's difficult to have doors opened to young filmmakers.<br /><br />TIM WATCHER seems to be an exercise in style	 color and carefully chosen plans	 combined with a fine score. That's all. There's nothing else. There's no plot. And that's a shame because it feels like a waste of production values. Hardly	 you can see in the regular Portuguese short such diversity of locations and so many available extras to enrich a story.<br /><br />As absurd as the comparison may sound	 I must refer the BMW shorts as a fine example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film severely conditioned to product placement and over-the-top stylish cinematography."	0.0
"Hallam Foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of Oedepus complex afterward.<br /><br />It is something like 95 minutes long but would be better in ten. There's like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops	 and habits in a church tower like Quasimodo (only he is much less sympathetic).<br /><br />There's a strange love story involved which doesn't have anything to do with anything. She happens to look like his mother	 yes so what? We know he misses his mother	 that's what the first ten minutes were about. They should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a O.K. short film. Now it's a portrait of a character who doesn't change. He is a guy that stuff happens to. The only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job.<br /><br />There's this whole Oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character. He paints his face	 dresses in women's clothing and wears a dead Badger on his head. A Badger! You've got to see the ending! He returns to his home with the badger on his head (and it is shot like a tacky Horror film) to kill his dad's new wife (which he had sex with in the beginning). And somehow they thought this wouldn't be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background. I've got to admit though	 I'm kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose. It feels like this MacKenzie director/guy/whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school. You are so smart! Thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories! You really dug! What a Wallraff! Okay so now I realized this film is based on some random book	 but anyway..<br /><br />Photowise it is boring. A lot of talking heads. Plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene	 you know cold and warm etc.. why? maybe ""Hallam Foe"" is both a feature and a test film for color blind people. Or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldn't be enough to tell us that he feels lonely	 so they increased blue so that we really get it.<br /><br />I'm not even gonna comment on the cliché indie-oh-how-how-how-cute drawings they have made in the presentation. And all the ""cute"" sex stuff going on. This whole film is an independent cliché. But I do recommend it. I laughed more than a few times. Though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine."	0.0
"I vaugely recall seeing this when I was 3 years old	 then my parents accidentally taped over all but a few seconds of it with some other cartoon. Then I was about 8 or 9 years old when I rediscovered it and since I was then able to comprehend things better	 I thought it was a good movie then. Fast forward to Just a few weeks ago (June 2006) when I re-re discovered it thanks to some internet articles/video clips and it's just not the same movie. I'm sure it's still good with the kids	 but to us 20-30 somethings it's definitely got ""Cult Status"" written all over it. It's a shame that the original production went through a painful process; if Fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today. Maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be	 but that's for Fox to decide. I'm rambling here	 I know. I Still think it's a great film	 but it could be better than great."	1.0
"Following a car accident	 a mad scientist(Jason Evers) keeps the head of his fiancee(Virgina Leith)alive. He then goes on the prowl looking for the perfect body to make her whole again.

"After seeing several movies of Villaronga	 I had a pretty clear opinion about him -- he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters	 forgetting about a rhythm of the movie. That is why	 though having good critics	 his movies never caught the broad audience attention. In ARo he follows the same line	 but really improved on the rhythm	 especially in the end of the movie. Frankly speaking	 I slept through the first part	 cause though the first part gives necessary information	 it is really slow. Nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by Villaronga.<br /><br />Recommended."	1.0
"I was interested to see the move thinking that it might be a diamond in the rough	 but the only thing I found was bad writing	 horrible directing (the shot sequences do not flow) even though the director might say that that is what he is going for	 it looks very uninspired and immature) the editing could have been done by anyone with 2 VCRs and the stock was low budget video. I would say that it wasn't even something as simple as mini digital video. <br /><br />There are some simple ways to fix a film with what the director has	 like through editing etc. But it is obvious that he just doesn't care. There is as much effort put in to this movie as a ham sandwich. It could be made better	 but that would mean extra work."	0.0
"I don't believe this was an acting challenge for Richard Harris. This was an uncomplicated plot	 yet interesting. It is a good movie to watch when you don't want to do a lot of thinking	 just want to be told a simple story. The Canadian scenery was breathtaking. The beautiful Fall shots alone made the picture worth seeing."	1.0
"Claire Denis's movies seem to fall into one of two categories: the violent and bloody or the quiet and intimate. ""L'Intrus"" definitely falls into the first category	 but it's not so awful as ""Trouble Every Day"" or ""J'ai pas sommeil.""<br /><br />Now	 ever since I saw ""Chocolat	"" I've made it a point to see every new movie Denis makes. And I have always been disappointed. ""L'Intrus"" was no exception. She has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as her first one. <br /><br />You get a lot of the Denis regulars: an older but still magnificent Béatrice Dalle who seems to be in the movie only to show off her full lips	 the gap between her teeth	 her ample cleavage	 and a couple of nice coats; the black guy from ""Trouble Every Day"" and ""J'ai pas sommeil	"" Grégoire Colin	 and that Lithuanian or Russian girl. Michel Subor's character was interesting enough	 but the camera lingered on him at such length that I got annoyed by that curly forelock of hair hanging over his forehead and was relieved when	 somewhere in Korea	 I think	 he finally got it cut. <br /><br />There was certainly some action--gruesome murders	 a man's search for a son--and there may even have been a plot	 but one viewing wasn't enough to figure it out	 and two viewings are	 I fear	 out of the question. For one thing	 the score was jarring and obtrusive (as in ""Beau Travail""). For another	 the seasons changed too abruptly	 leaving you even more confused about what was going on. Oh	 there were a few pretty shots	 and if you liked ""Friday Evening"" with its shots of the folds in heavy drapes and bedsheets	 you might appreciate the aesthetics of ""L'Intrus."" Otherwise	 steer clear. <br /><br />I saw this movie in French and it's possible I missed something crucial. But the dialogue in a Denis movie rarely amounts to more than five pages	 double spaced and with ample margins. In ""Chocolat"" the silence is sublime; in ""L'Intrus	"" it's just dull."	0.0
"This stirring western spins the tale of the famous rifle of the early west that was coveted by one and all. James Stewart is the cowboy who wins the prized Winchester in a shootout	 only to lose it in a robbery. The story details Stewart's pursuit of the rifle and a certain man through the film. The rifle changes hands time after time	 as though the owner is fated to lose it through violence. The picture has plenty of action and suspense as Stewart closes in on his quarry. A great cast supports Stewart here	 namely Stephen McNally	 Dan Duryea	 Millard Mitchell	 John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen. Shelley Winters seems miscast here and the purpose of her role is rather obscure. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson	 teen heartthrobs in later years	 have brief but good roles."	1.0
"For what it is	 ""Raising Victor Vargas"" is about as close to perfection as a film can get. Either sheer genius from a fledgling auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked (probably some of each)	 this simple little slice-of-urban-life ethnic first love flick fleshes out its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds. The film begins with a strong flavor of ""street"" but works its way into a Latino family affair and then focuses on a story which speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love another. In my experience	 never has so much been done with so little (cast of tyros	 novice director	 etc.). Praised by the critics but not for everyone	 ""Raising Victor Vargas"" is recommended for indie lovers and realists into simple tales rich in humanness. (A)"	1.0
"We first watched this film as part of a festival of new Argentine films in 2000 at the Walter Reade. Although we liked it	 we didn't think it was extraordinary. Watching it for a second time	 we found a different meaning in this look at life in Buenos Aires.<br /><br />The film takes place in one of the darkest days of Argentina	 as the DeLaRua administration was ending. The country was in turmoil after the economy	 which had flourished earlier in the 1990s	 under the artificially climate President Menen created. It was a time when bank accounts in dollars were frozen and people got themselves living a nightmare.<br /><br />The story begins just as Santamarina	 a bank employee	 is fired because the collapse of the economy. Instead of receiving sympathy from his wife	 she locks him out of the apartment and he	 for all practical purposes	 becomes a homeless man. He takes to the streets trying to make ends meet.<br /><br />The other story introduces us to Ariel	 a young Jew	 interviewing for a job in a Spanish company. It's almost a miracle he gets the job. His father	 Simon	 owns a small restaurant in the Jewish quarter of ""El Once"" in the center of the city. Things go from bad to worse	 when Ariel's mother dies suddenly. Only Estela	 the young woman who is in love with Ariel	 comes to help father and son.<br /><br />Santamarina	 who is a clean man	 has to resort to take showers wherever he can. He chooses a ladies' room in one of the subway stations. When the attendant	 Elsa	 finds him naked	 she becomes furious	 but she comes to her senses when she realizes the unhappy circumstances of this man who has seen better times. They become romantically involved	 and Santamarina in one of his trips through the street garbage	 finds an infant. Elsa	 while surprised	 wants to do the right thing. But Santamarina convinces her of the meaning of an innocent life in their lives will cement their love.<br /><br />Ariel	 who has met the gorgeous Laura at work	 begins a turbulent and heavy sexual affair with his beautiful co-worker	 who unknown to him	 is involved in a lesbian affair. Ariel who free lances by photographing weddings and other occasions	 feels a passion for Laura	 but he realizes what Estela has sacrificed in order to help his father and still loves him.<br /><br />Daniel Burman	 whose ""El Abrazo Partido"" we thought was excellent	 did wonders with this film. Things are put in its proper perspective after a second viewing recently and we must apologize for not having perceived it the first time around. If anything	 this second time	 the nuances of the screen play Mr. Burman and Emiliano Torres wrote	 make more sense because they reflect the turmoil of what the country was living during those dark days.<br /><br />Daniel Hendler	 who plays Ariel	 has collaborated with Mr. Burman before to surprising results. He is not 'movie star pretty'	 yet	 he is handsome. This actor projects a tremendous sincerity in his work. Enrique Pineyro is another magnificent surprise. His Santamarina is disarming. In spite of all the bad things that have fallen on him	 he keeps a rosy attitude toward everyone he meets. Stefania Sandrelli	 the interesting Italian actress	 makes a great contribution to the film with her Elsa. Hector Alterio	 one of the best Argentine actors plays the small part of Simon. The gorgeous Chiara Coselli is seen as Laura and Melina Petrielli appears as the noble Estela.<br /><br />""Esperando al mesias"" proves Daniel Burman is a voice to be reckoned with in the Argentine cinema."	1.0

"The TV guide calls this movie a mystery. What is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable trash level this film so perfectly represents. This is Bollywood at its best/worst	 I honestly cannot tell the difference. Nauseatingly sweet	 kitschy clichés on every level	 story-line	 situations	 dialog	 music and choreography. To put it bluntly	 you must be a retard to enjoy it. I watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity	 but there were times when I had to walk away from it	 because I could not take it any more. The only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses. <br /><br />"	0.0
"6/10 Acting	 not great but some good acting.<br /><br />4/10 Director	 makes some stupid decisions for this film.<br /><br />2/10 Writer	 story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws.<br /><br />4/10 Overall score for this movie.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this film	 it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much. Characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens ""storywise""	 not in good way. Because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards). It's always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there's too many tracks in this one. In the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialogs and musics"	0.0
"Dear me... Peter Sellers was one of the most oddly talented actors there has been. But his choice of films	 say	 after 1964	 was very unfortunate. He didn't seem to realize how to use his talents. He would have been better off working with more of the Kubricks of the film world than the people he did. Of his later films	 only ""The Optimists of Nine Elms"" and ""Being There"" have impressed me of those I have seen.<br /><br />That said	 the Boultings and Sellers had made a few films prior to this that hardly sound that bad - I have yet to see ""Carlton Browne"" and ""Heavens Above!"" - at least in the sense of using Sellers well to a degree. But	 ""There's a Girl in My Soup"" really is a poor film and a dire choice on Sellers' part in terms of character. In his films from 1955-64	 you can usually expect at least some very inventive twist and always an enigmatic conviction in his roles. Here	 you have Peter Sellers trying to play a typical romantic lead. It's almost Sellers playing a Niven cad without the joviality. He certainly does not convince	 try as he might	 or create an interesting character. He should have left such parts to masters of suavity such as Cary Grant	 and concentrated on those intriguing dramatic and comic roles that he was famed for.<br /><br />Hawn and Sellers really do not establish any genuine chemistry; this is no easy	 genial romance of the like perfected by William Powell and Myrna Loy. It is very artificial seeming	 all the way through - I know that it is part of Danvers' character that he is a dry procurer of ladies	 but he doesn't really change from that in a way that convinces. Sellers has a very grating way of playing ""charm"" as well... this character really has no depth	 and really does not gain the viewer's sympathy or interest. Sellers goes through the motions in a way one would not think possible when remembering the magnificence of his shifty	 iconoclastic performance in ""Lolita"".<br /><br />There really is nothing to say about the plot	 direction or characters	 as frankly they leave little or no impression. This is truly one of the most anaemic	 complacent	 misguided and lightly dull films I have ever seen. A nonentity of a ""vehicle"" for Sellers' undisputed talents.<br /><br />Rating:- * 1/2/*****"	0.0
"Matthau and Lemmon are at their very best in this one - everyone else in the movie are also great. The Dialogue is excellent and very	 very witty - and the scene where Lemmon's character attempts to clear out his sinuses in a restaurant have me rolling on the floor with laughter every time I see it. Anyone who happened to see the not so great sequel should not be turned away from the original. I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone - I just love it. And the fact the Jack Lemmon plays his character so straight forward with tragic overtones only adds to the hilariousness in my opinion. These two great guys made a string of movies together	 but this one is the best - no doubt."	1.0
"We all know what's like when we have a bad day at the office	 right? Well	 this Neil Simon comedy looks at what it's like when you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office. Sometimes	 it's just not worth going	 know what I mean? And	 sometimes	 it's just not worth doing something when it's already been done before	 in 1970	 with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis... and much better also.<br /><br />It's not that Steve Martin is a lousy comedian or wrong for the role as the harried and stressed advertising exec; quite to the contrary	 on both counts. And	 it's not that Goldie Hawn is equally inept either; her work has been consistently good	 if not great	 ever since I first saw her in TV's Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In of the 1960s.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that it's not about the hapless couple at all: it's really about New York and why everybody should come to New York to live and love their lives away in married bliss  sort of  in the greatest city in the world. That's if you're a New Yorker...<br /><br />Look	 the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere	 and included most of the situations and sight gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment. This 1999 version unfortunately goes off into gratuitous tangents specifically for an audience these days that expects or wants to see excess. For example	 not content with the star appeal of the main players	 there is a cameo (relatively long also) from Rudy Giuliani	 then mayor of New York	 as we all know. What  Giuliani bucking for President even then? Worse  a walking talking advertisement for the kinder face of New York.<br /><br />And then we have John Cleese	 reprising his role as Basil Fawlty  but this time	 as a prancing cross-dresser also  once again browbeating hotel staff	 sycophantically sucking up to rich customers and generally making himself look like the idiot he is	 in this role. And	 in the process	 doing great damage to the memory of Fawlty Towers	 arguably the best British comedy series	 bar none...<br /><br />Why was this 1999 movie made? In the 1970s	 New York was a dying city	 in many ways. It was almost literally bankrupt. So	 when made in 1970	 that was the city you saw: grim	 dark	 moody	 unsettling and not the place that the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in the Big Smoke (as it was then	 polluted and all). By 1999	 things had gotten better: glitz was back	 New York was thriving	 it was the Big Apple	 ready for you to bite into	 if you had the moxie...<br /><br />So	 naturally	 the couple in this second coming find that moxie within themselves and finally join the fabulous fray to continue the American dream of life	 liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Hence	 this movie is truly comic but not for reasons that the producers perhaps envisaged. As much as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in comedy	 this movie is a travesty of the much better one made with the great Jack Lemmon. If you've seen the latter	 then definitely don't bother with this one."	0.0
"I loved the first Little Mermaid. I know the songs	 I love the characters and I love the story. I can't say anything like that about The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea. It was terrible. Let's start with the story. The plot was a reversed copy of the first movie. Same situations	 except in reverse! Ariel wanted to live on land	 her daughter Melody (creative name) wants to live in the sea. Ariel was tricked by Ursula	 Melody is tricked by Ursula's sister	 Morgana. Ursula had a sister?? Not sure where that came from. Besides being a strange copy of the first movie	 this movies plot seemed tired and was uninteresting compared to the first movie. Now the characters: 1. Ariel- What happened to her??!! No longer the spunky	 headstrong teenager we all knew and loved from the first movie	 she has now ""grown up"" and her personality went down the drain. Her singing voice wasn't as strong either	 due to either Jodi Benson being a lot older	 or the songs being so terrible that her talent was wasted. 2. Prince Eric- While he didn't have a lot of personality in the first movie	 like all Disney princes	 somehow his new voice and his very few lines made him even more robotic. To top it off	 he just can't seem to defend himself	 and Ariel becomes the tough one of the two. 3. Sebastian- Say goodbye to the lovable crustacean from the first movie	 because a whiny	 aggravating little crab just took his place. He also had no good songs in this movie. You can almost forget the glory he earned from singing the incredible ""Under the Sea"" and ""Kiss the Girl"" from the first movie	 and it is very sad. 4. Flounder- They destroyed him!! He is not cute anymore	 his voice is terrible	 and he has kids now?? Who's the mother??? 5. Morgana- She appears to be Ursula's sister out for revenge against her mother	 who always picked Ursula over her. So she plans to get King Triton's trident to become the new ruler of the sea. Sound familiar? Anyway	 she's a very cliché villain and falls short of Ursula's greatness as a villain. She epically fails at witchcraft	 she's not very tough	 and not threatening at all. 6.Melody- Ariel and Eric's daughter. Ironic name because she	 unlike Ariel	 can't sing. Her voice is annoying	 her friends (a walrus and a penguin?? Really?!) are not funny or likable	 and she's exactly the same as Ariel	 in reverse and not as likable. Skip this one. Don't watch any Disney sequel except for Lion King 2. This movie butchered the classic that lives in all our pleasant memories. I will look back at this movie and just laugh."	0.0
"Armageddon PPV<br /><br />The last PPV of 2006<br /><br />Smackdown brand.<br /><br />Match Results Ahead********<br /><br />We are starting the show with The Inferno match. Kane v. MVP. This was an okay match. Nothing about wrestling here. This was about the visuals. Overall	 this was not bad. There were a few close spots here with Kane getting too close to the fire	 but in the end	 Kane won with ramming MVP into the fire back first.<br /><br />Nice opener. Let's continue.<br /><br />Teddy Long announces a new match for the tag team titles: London and Kendrick will defend against: Regal and Taylor	 The Hardyz	 and MNM IN A LADDER MATCH!!!! Let's get moving!<br /><br />Match two: Fatal four way ladder match. This was total carnage. Judging by three out of the four teams here	 you would expect chaos. The spots were amazing. A total spot-fest. One point Jeff went for Poetry in Motion and London moved and Jeff hit the ladder! Shortly afterword	 Jeff is set on the top rope with two ladders nearby as MNM were going to kill Jeff	 Matt makes the save and Jeff hits the ""see-saw"" shot to Joey Mercury! Mercury is hurt. His eye is shut quickly and is busted open hard way. Mercury is taken out of the match and Nitro is still there. He is going to fight alone for the titles! Regal and Taylor then grab London and suplex him face-first into the ladder! Jeff climbs the ladder and Nitro in a killer spot	 dropkicks through the ladder to nail Jeff! Awesome! In the end	 London and Kendrick retain the tag team titles. What a match!!!<br /><br />This was insane. I can't figure out why WWE did not announce this till now. The Buyrate would increase huge. I'm sure the replay value will be good though.<br /><br />Mercury has suffered a shattered nose and lacerations to the eye. He is at the hospital now. Get well kid.<br /><br />No way anything else here will top that.<br /><br />Next up: The Miz v. Boogeyman.(Ugh) This was a nothing match. Will the Boogeyman ever wrestle? The Miz sucks too. After a insane crowd	 this kills them dead. DUD.<br /><br />Chris Benoit v. Chavo. This was a strong match. I enjoyed it. Chavo hit a killer superplex at one point! Benoit hit EIGHT German suplexes too! Benoit wins with the sharpshooter. Good stuff.<br /><br />Helms v. Yang-Cruiserweight title championship match. This was a good match. Unfortunately	 the stupid fans did not care for this. WHY? Helms and Yang are very talented and wrestled well. I agree with JBL. He ranted to the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate this or get out. <br /><br />Mr. Kennedy v. The Undertaker-Last Ride match. Not too much here. This was a slug fest	 with a few exceptions. Kennedy at one point tossed Taker off the top of the stage to the floor. The spot was fine. Reaction was disappointing. The end spot was Taker tomb-stoned Kennedy on the hearse and won the match. Unreal. Kennedy needed this win. They both worker hard. Still	 Kennedy needed this win. Undertaker should have lost. Creative screwed up again.<br /><br />A stupid diva thing is next. I like women. Not this. At least Torrie was not here. That's refreshing. Judging from the crowd	 Layla should have won. The WWE wanted Ashley. Consider this your bathroom break. Next.<br /><br />Main Event: Cena & Batista v. Finlay & Booker T. This was also a nothing match. The focus was Cena v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Booker can't work well together. Finlay tries to make Cena look good. The finish was botched. Finlay hit Batista's knee with a chair shot and Batista no-sold the shot and finished the match. Lame. Not main event caliber at all.<br /><br />Overall	 Armageddon would have scored less	 but the ladder match WAS the main event here. That was enough money's worth right there. A few others were solid. <br /><br />The Last Word: A good PPV with the ladder match being the savior. Smackdown is not a bad show just is not compelling enough. Smackdown needs to stop letting Cena tag along. Let Smackdown stand on their own two legs. This show proves that Smackdown can."	1.0
"Recently I was looking for the newly issued Wide Screen DVD of FLY AWAY HOME and came upon interesting title that I had never heard of: GREY OWL. The fact that it was a Richard Attenborough Film caught my attention (he responsible for such fine films as GANDHI	 CHAPLIN	 and SHADOWLANDS). I noticed that the screenplay was by William Nicholson (author of SHADOWLANDS). This ""Special Edition"" was full of interesting sounding material and the price was just under $10.00 -- so I chanced it & bought it. WOW! What a beautiful film. Pierce Brosnan stars as Archie Grey Owl	 a real life trapper in the 1930s	 who came to love and respect the wild lands of Canada	 and worked to help protect them. Brosnan (who starred in a James Bond film) gives a shaded	 warm	 powerful performance as does Annie Galipeau as the young woman who loves and influences his feeling for the creatures of the land -- especially the beaver. A fine score by George Fenton (THE CRUCIBLE) and beautiful photograhy by Roger Pratt add greatly to the effectiveness of the film. AND the extras on this DVD are something else! Includes two shorts made in the 1930s with the real Grey Owl as well as audio commentary tracks by Attenborough and Producer Jake Eberts; 2 Featurettes; and many other fine additions PLUS options for those having access to a PC with DVD-ROM features. GREY OWL has been released directly to DVD in the United States -- a fact that Richard Attenborough attributes to Hollywood's lack of interest in distributing something that isn't loaded with a lot of violence and sex. This is a film that not only informs and entertains but leaves you with something to think about. I had a very warm feeling at the films conclusion -- and a whole new love and understanding for beavers! GREY OWL is a very fine film -- worth checking out! This is one I look forward to sharing with others."	1.0

"I saw this bomb when it hit theaters. I laughed the whole time. Why? Because the stupidity of it seemed to have made me go insane. I look back on it and realize there was not ONE funny thing in the whole movie. At leat nothing intentional. It IS awfully funny that Lizzie cn chew a piece of Nurplex and become a gigantic	 carnivorous demon...yet her itty-bitty little dress is perfectly intact	 despite the fact that she is now hundreds of times larger than she was when she first put it on. Or the kind of movie in which a man can be shocked with a defibulator and only fall unconcious	 and return to conciousness without ANY medical attention. And don't let me get started on the ridiculous fate of the ""villain"" that they decided they needed to create ""conflict."" Uh huh.<br /><br />To the person complaining about Disney only targetting kids-The raunchy parts of this film seems to disprove that statement. Do we really need Daryl Hannah accusing Jeff Bridges of having kinky video tapes? You do if you're Disney and you're out of ideas for making the movie appeal to the above-8 crowd without writing a more intelligent script! I am thoroughly convinced that Disney pays off the ratings board so it's movies can get away with murder and still get family-friendly ratings.<br /><br />What a waste of the DVD format."	0.0
"This is an abysmal piece of story-telling. It is about an hour into the movie before we have much idea of what it is supposed to be about; the characters often mumble inaudibly; actions frequently seem to have no relation to each other; nobody seems to be concerned about who actually murdered the girl; a pair of spooky kids go swimming in waters that seem threatening but nothing happens; the Irishman gets punched in the face by one of his buddies for no apparent reason ... to continue would be as boring as the movie itself. The only half-entertaining element is the landscape photography; but anyone could point a camera at the Australian outback a get memorable shots. Overall - dreary	 incoherent	 pretentious - and downright annoying for wasting so much of the viewer's time."	0.0

The movie opens with the beautiful son ""Stay Away"" and the scenery of the Grand Canyon gives the viewer hope of something special. Elvis gets in the picture and his talent is wasted big time	 especially on the rest of the featured songs. I sat through this movie twice	 just to make sure it is a piece of junk!!! 1 out of 10!!!"	0.0
"Relative to other Columbo movies	 this can only be rated a 1 (awful). I seriously do not understand what the other reviewers have seen in this appalling train-crash of a film. It was only through morbid fascination that I continued to watch it - to see what bizarre or inept decision the director would make next.<br /><br />Another reviewer suggested that it was Falk's only directorial outing because it interfered with his acting role. In fact	 I think the real reason lies with the studio bosses	 who must have been horrified when they saw what he had done with their money. It's a wonder they didn't murder HIM."	0.0
"I love this movie like no other. Another time I will try to explain its virtues to the uninitiated	 but for the moment let me quote a few of pieces the remarkable dialogue	 which	 please remember	 is all tongue in cheek. Aussies and Poms will understand	 everyone else-well?<br /><br />(title song lyric)""he can sink a beer	 he can pick a queer	 in his latest double-breasted Bondi gear.""<br /><br />(another song lyric) ""All pommies are bastards	 bastards	 or worse	 and England is the a**e-hole of the universe.""<br /><br />(during a television interview on an ""arty program""): Mr Mackenzie what artists have impressed you most since you've been in England? (Barry's response)Flamin' bull-artists!<br /><br />(while chatting up a naive young pom girl): Mr Mackenzie	 I suppose you have hordes of Aboriginal servants back in Australia? (Barry's response) Abos? I've never seen an Abo in me life. Mum does most of the solid yacca (ie hard work) round our place.<br /><br />This is just a taste of the hilarious farce of this bonser Aussie flick. If you can get a copy of it	 watch and enjoy."	1.0
"Human pot roast Joe Don Baker (MITCHELL) stars in this dull	 unremarkable `action' movie as Deputy Geronimo	 a fat	 gassy slob who sits around in a stupid looking cowboy suit	 listening to country music and eating too many donuts. Meanwhile	 a vaguely criminal guy named Palermo (played by the guy who owned the drill in Fulci's GATES OF HELL) stumbles into Joe Don's territory and shoots the sheriff in a poorly edited scene. Joe Don- slowly- gives chase and offs Palermo's brother after uttering his now legendary catch phrase `It's your move. Think you can take me? Well	 go ahead on'. For some reason Joe Don	 a Texas lawman	 must transport Palermo to Italy (`Mr. Palermo's been a major source of embarrassment to the Italian government	' says Mr. Wilson	 another vague character played by Bill McKinney	 who was in MASTER NINJA 1	 SHE FREAK	 and a lot of good Clint Eastwood movies). <br /><br />Anyhoo	 Joe Don's plane must land on the island of Malta	 where Palermo escapes with the help of a briefcase and a guy who looks like Jon Lovitz. And that's where the movie grinds to a halt. For the rest of the movie	 Joe Don looks for Palermo	 looses Palermo	 ends up in a jail cell	 is yelled at by the Malta chief of police	 and then is let go with a warning not to look for Palermo any more. Then Joe Don keeps looking for Palermo	 looses Palermo	 ends up in a jail cell	 is yelled at by the Malta chief of police	 and then is let go with a warning not to look for Palermo any more. Then Joe Don looks for Palermo	 looses Palermo	 ends up in a jail cell	 is yelled at by the Malta chief of police	 and then is let go with a warning not to look for Palermo any more. This is one aggravating movie.<br /><br />At one point Joe Don is thought to be dead at sea. All the other characters wonder if he's dead or not	 finally concluding that he is. But then he shows up (he was rescued by a poor family) and no one mentions the fact that he was missing at sea for several days. Even his cute	 Julia Louise-Dreyfuss-esque sidekick doesn't welcome him back. She does	 however	 offer to help him find Palermo	 so Joe Don looks for Palermo	 looses Palermo	 ends up in a jail cell	 is yelled at by the Malta chief of police	 and then let go with a warning not to look for Palermo any more.<br /><br />Highpoints include	 a bizarre carnival with strange colorful floats	 some sexy strippers	 a shoot out involving a kid dressed like Napoleon AND a cart of tomatoes	 a chase scene involving a guy dressed like a monk	 and any scene without Joe Don.

The flimsy plot isn't meant to be taken seriously - why else make Merlin a heavy when in most	 if not all	 of the other versions he is more a friend/mentor to Arthur - so if you start wondering aloud why Sir Lancelot who has been sold to historians as the epitome of chivalry and uprightness metamorphoses into a schoolyard bully you're not going to get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie.

"I have to be honest	 i was expecting a failure so bad	 because it really did sound like they were trying to milk the original movie to get money. But that wasn't the case with this pretty funny (sometimes odd) movie. I loved how they told the story of Timon and Pumba	 the story with Simba and him having trouble sleeping was funny. The jacuzzi bubble	 and when Pumba leaves	 the bubbles stop. It's all harmless fun	 good for kids and some adults. I think this movie will last for a while because it is rather good for a straight to Video and DVD movie. While the movie does seem a little odd and kind of trails off toward the end	 it works. 8 out of 10"	1.0

"In modern day Eastern Europe life is hard and for young women prostitution is one of the only career options and one taken	 reluctantly	 by Melania.

She has two pimps with differring emotional attachments to her and she is generally passed around like some piece of baggage with no feelings of her own.

Much of the time I had no idea what was supposed to be happening and very rarely did I care. People began leaving the screening almost before the last latecomers had arrived and I don't think I've ever seen so many people walk out.<br /><br />Images are important to the director - characters slowly emerge from or disappear into a dark screen	 we get long lingering shots of nothing in particular and one sex scene takes place in infra-red. In fact for such an unconventional film the sex scenes were remarkably ordinary; missionary positions between naked people in bed abounded and there were no drugs or related weirdness. But perhaps these days being ordinary is unconventional.<br /><br />On the whole	 almost entirely without merit.<br /><br />"	0.0
"""Like the first touch of pleasure and guilt	 like a spontaneous youthful flirt of fascination and fear	 like a climax of contrary emotions"" said one of the movie buffs after viewing LOVE AT THE TOP	 the misinterpreted title version of stylish director Michel Deville's LE MOUTON ENRAGE. <br /><br />Vincent Canby in New York Times	 however	 just after the 1974 premiere of the movie stated: ""LOVE AT THE TOP which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse	 is a 1973 French comedy that dimly recalls a number of nineteen-fifties English comedies about the rise and rise of cynical young men possessingand possessed byambition."" Yet	 the significant difference that he mentioned was the fact that LOVE AT THE TOP is not concerned with the English class system...(January 27	 1975)<br /><br />Having left the evaluations up to single individuals	 of course	 the test of time has done its just job. What may be said with certainty after more than 30 years is that we can hardly find such movies like LE MOUTON ENRAGE where decadence appears innocent	 where liaisons appear youthfully enthusiastic	 where feelings occur so manipulative. <br /><br />For Romy Schneider's fans	 it seems useless to point out that this film is a must see	 not only because she gives a unique performance (as she did in all of her roles) at the heyday of her career (9 years before her sudden death) but because she is particularly attractive here. It is not TRIO INFERNAL where the	 so to say	 'forced escape' from and the mockery of Romy's sweet image haunted for years by saccharine Sissi meets its most discouraging manifestation	 but a film where the brilliant actress is given a fair role. She plays Roberte	 a woman who becomes the object of lust for the story's lead	 playboy Nicolas Mallet (Jean Louis Trintignant). It is him who takes financial profits from lustful liaisons. This movie can boast truly memorable and unique shots of Romy and she is given some of her very best scenes. Romy's sex appeal is unforgettable here.<br /><br />Another strong point of the film is its execution of the content with a development of individual perception. Immoral as it may seem	 the director makes a perfect use of contrast: conventions vs pleasures	 innocence vs decadence	 genuine lust vs instrumental affair. Nicola owns most of the features that viewers may like or detest	 may find attractive or disgusting; yet	 his are the features the viewers must treat seriously	 more to say	 they are the ones we all must accept. That is why	 one is led to a peculiar	 gently wild	 erotically unique world of the main character. Although he sleeps with lots of women	 there are two women that represent a sort of contrary worlds for Nicola: Roberte Groult (Romy Schneider) and Marie-Paul (Jane Birkin). He manipulates them	 makes love to them	 cannot refrain from both desire for their bodies and desire for money; yet	 he perceives them differently. Yet	 despite all of this 'adult maturity	' he is emotionally like a little boy who plays with a toy-car on the table - a sort of 'detailed insight into male mind...' in a comedy-like way	 of course.<br /><br />Finally	 there are very good performances	 which makes LE MOUTON ENRAGE slightly underrated. Not only the aforementioned Romy Schneider does a brilliant job supplying the viewers with an extraordinary insight into her role	 but young Jane Birkin appears to be convincing in the role of young	 inexperienced streetwalker Marie Paul	 Jean Louis Trintignant makes it possible to see Nicola in the right way. This artistic merit lying in performances goes with terrific music by Camille Saint-Saëns	 the tune that will ring in your ears for long. Therefore	 apart from some flaws of the movie like dated colors	 slow action (sometimes)	 possible clichés (noticed by some viewers)	 the merits should be found significant. <br /><br />LE MOUTON ENRAGE	 in sum	 is a clear manifestation of contrary manipulative tools in life. It is worth seeing as a moment in Romy's career	 a prelude to strong eroticism	 a chain of contrary emotions	 of love and hatred	 appreciation and disgust compared to the first orgasm and the first angasm... But aren't we	 humans	 'viewers	' movie buffs built upon such contrasts?"	1.0
"After not having much luck at selling his screenplays to the new movie industry during the first decade of the 20th Century	 in 1908 playwright D.W. Griffith got the job that would make him a legend: he was hired by the Biograph Company as a director of movies. It wasn't really what Griffith had expected when he decided to enter the movie business	 but he accepted the job	 and in less than a year he became Biograph's most successful director thanks to his original approach to film-making and the wild inventive of his narrative. Many years later	 he would direct ""The Birth of a Nation"" in 1915	 the movie that would revolutionize film-making and make him one of cinema's first recognized authors; however	 a lot of what would make him a great filmmaker can be found in the many short films he made for Biograph Company in the early years of his career. 1909's ""The Sealed Room"" is one of those	 and also one of the few horror movies of that very first decade of the 20th Century.<br /><br />""The Sealed Room"" is a story set in the 16th Century in which a Count (Arhtur V. Johnson) has built a windowless room in his castle. It is a small yet nice and very cozy room	 as it is meant to be used to enjoy the love and company of his wife	 the Countess (Marion Leonard) in a more private way. However	 the Count doesn't know that his wife is not exactly faithful	 as she is infatuated with the Minstrel (Henry B. Walthall) at Court	 with whom she is having an affair. As soon as the Count gets busy with his own business	 the Countess calls the Minstrel and both lovers go to enjoy the Count's new room. When the Count returns	 he discovers she is missing and begins to suspect	 finally discovering the two lovers in his room; but instead of making a scene	 he prefers to remain hidden as he decides that there is a better punishment for his unfaithful wife: to seal the windowless room with the couple inside.<br /><br />Written by Griffiths' regular collaborator Frank E. Woods	 ""The Sealed Room"" takes elements from Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Cask of Amontillado"" and mainly Honoré De Balzac's ""La Grande Breteche"" to create a haunting Gothic melodrama based on the themes of treachery and sadism. Despite having a runtime of 11 minutes	 Woods' screenplay develops the story in a very good way	 and plays remarkably well with the horror elements of the story. While a melodrama at heart	 Woods focus on the character of the Count and his sadism creates one of the best horror characters of these early era. ""The Sealed Room"" is definitely a very simple and basic story	 but Woods handling of the dark and morbid thematic of its plot makes the story a very entertaining film that was very different than most Griffith's melodramas.<br /><br />In ""The Sealed Room""	 Griffith uses his talents to experiment with tension and suspense in a different way than his usual. While he often played with editing to create thrillers that excited his audience	 in this movie his focus was to create desperation and horror	 playing with the inherent feeling of claustrophobia that the source stories had. It is interesting how the story starts as another of his melodramas and slowly the pacing becomes faster as the horror themes begin to dominate the plot	 culminating in his great use of editing for the final scenes. Not being a movie where camera tricks are essential	 what shines the most in ""The Sealed Room"" is Griffith's talent to direct his actors	 as the legendary filmmaker manages to bring the best out of his cast with his usual natural style far removed from the staginess that was the norm in his day.<br /><br />As usual	 the cast was comprised of usual collaborators of Griffith	 starting with Arthur V. Johnson as the Count. Johnson gives a great performance and truly conveys the character's transition from loving husband to sadistic monster. His performance is not without a touch of overacting	 but actually that adds realism to the character's exaggerated personality. As the Countess	 Marion Leonard looks very good and is also very effective in her acting	 conveying a natural charm that makes hard not to sympathize with her in her treachery. Finally	 the legendary Henry B. Walthall appears as the handsome Minstrel	 and while far from being one of his best performances	 he manages to give a proficient acting that also adds a nice touch of comedy to the film. While not of real importance to the plot	 it's nice to see other members of Griffith's stock company in the background	 like his wife Linda Arvidson and a young Mary Pickford as nobles at Court.<br /><br />While not exactly a masterpiece	 ""The Sealed Room"" is a notable exercise of editing to create suspense and tension like Griffith used to do in those days. The movie has very good set design and while of a very low budget	 Griffith's care for details makes it look very convincing and works perfectly along with his directing style. The change of focus to horror makes it to stand out among other of his films from that era	 and Johnson's performance as the sadistic Count makes it worth a watch. While Griffith will always be remembered for his highly influential (and controversial) ""The Birth of a Nation""	 the early short films he made before it really give a good idea of the development of the techniques and the style that would make him a legend. Simple yet elegant	 ""The Sealed Room"" is a fun movie to watch and one of the few horrors of the first decade of the 20th Century. 7/10"	1.0
"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only lacks any acting skill	 but the script is incredibly shallow and lame. You actually hear serious dialogue that goes	 ""I love you more."" ""No	 I love YOU more."" I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour	 I couldn't take it anymore. Her ""southern girl charm"" just doesn't work and is really quite annoying; her attempts at slapstick humor fall flat and she delivers lines like she is reading the script right off the page.<br /><br />Poor Luke Wilson. Did he not read the script before agreeing to do this	 or did he fall for Papa Joe's (Jessica's dad and also the producer of the movie) promise of big profits? Hopefully he now knows better than to sign on to another movie like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate seeing the pained look on his face as he suffers through the bad dialogue.<br /><br />Also	 I think the previous commenter giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie somehow or hired by Papa Joe to give the movie a better rating. No one in their right mind would actually find this movie engaging.<br /><br />Jessica has lots of money	 right? Maybe buy some acting lessons?"	0.0
"When a film is independent and not rated	 such as the Hamiltons	 I was expecting out of the norm	 cut out your heart violence. I know that good movies don't always contain blood and violence	 but I read reviews	 I visited the website	 and I even convinced a few of my friends to pay $9.50 to see this god awful movie with me. When there is a festival called Horrorfest	 I am expecting horror	 not Dawsons Creek with incestuous undertones. My expectations were extremely low for this film	 yet the little expectations there was for the film were shot to hell once I saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first drop of blood come out of someones finger. There were too many plot holes and left too much to the imagination. I regret not seeing Happy Feet. I think there might have been more violence and gore in that movie than in the Hamiltons!"	0.0
"This is to the Zatoichi movies as the ""Star Trek"" movies were to ""Star Trek""--except that in this case every one of the originals was more entertaining and interesting than this big	 shiny re-do	 and also better made	 if substance is more important than surface. Had I never seen them	 I would have thought this good-looking but empty; since I had	 I thought its style inappropriate and its content insufficient. The idea of reviving the character in a bigger	 slicker production must have sounded good	 but there was no point in it	 other than the hope of making money; it's just a show	 which mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the character's world and wholly fails to take the character anywhere he hasn't been already (also	 the actor wasn't at his best). I'd been hoping to see Ichi at a late stage of life	 in a story that would see him out gracefully and draw some conclusion from his experience overall; this just rehashes bits and pieces from the other movies	 seasoned with more sex and sfx violence. Not the same experience at all."	0.0
"This flick was a blow to me. I guess little girls should aspire to be nothing more than swimsuit models	 home makers or mistresses	 since that seems to be all they'll ever be portrayed as anyway. It is truly saddening to see an artist's work and life being so unjustly misinterpretated. Inconcievably (or perhaps it should have been expected)	 Artemisia's entire character and all that she stands for	 had been reduced to a standard Hollywood	 female character; a pitiful	 physically flawless	 helpless little creature	 displaying none of the character traits that actually got her that place in history which was being mutilated here. Sadder yet	 was to see that a great part of the audience was too badly educated in the area to comprehend the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film	 and reality. To portray the artist as someone in love with her real-life rapist	 someone whom she in reality accused of raping her even when under torture	 just plain pisses me off. If the director had nothing more substantial to say she should have refrained from basing her story on a real person."	0.0

"This movie is incomprehendably bad. It begins with several random explosions and then cuts to a sock puppet of a T-Rex that talks (!) to the audience. It goes back and forth between sock puppetry and animation throughout	 probably because the film makers couldn't afford live actors. I'll spare you the long	 tiresome	 relentless plot that drags this pitiful film on for a brutal 85 minutes.<br /><br />One of my friends found this very rare video at a hobby shop somewhere that sells out of print b-movies	 and he bought it for the sole purpose of making fun of it	 but	 as it turns out	 our intervention was not neecessary. This film makes fun of itself better than we could.<br /><br />I thought that Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" was the cheesiest movie in existence	 but leave it to Japanamation/Lego cars/Sock puppets to outdo him. If you see this movie anywhere	 buy it without hesitation. It is very rare and worth many	 many good laughs."	0.0
"This woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling. So she goes to find out that her neighbor above her is a photographer. This movie could have had a great plot but then the plot drains of any hope. The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds	 someone is snorting heroin. If they took out the scenes where someone snorts heroin	 then this would be a pretty good movie. Every time I thought that a scene was going somewhere	 someone inhaled the white powder. It was really lame to have that much drug use in one movie. It pulled attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer. The lesbian stuff didn't bother me.

"I am of ""the Christopher Reeve Generation"" it is fair to say that he was the best actor to play Superman yet	 but that doesn't stop me from enjoying other actors in the role	 and George Reeves makes a pretty good bid to knock Chris off the top	 though he just barely falls short. That doesn't stop me from enjoying this film	 it has a lot going for it. It has all that a movie needs	 a plot with beginning	 middle	 and end	 plus all those parts are intelligently written. The film is edgy both in acting and storyline	 something a film-noir but with tights. The story is both exciting and meaningful	 this is a movie with a message that isn't too preachy. I am still amazed this was shot over 12 days	 oh the glory days of Hollywood	 when we didn't have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie would fall into development hell... The film is polished and expertly made	 directed by Lee ""Roll'em"" Sholem	 best known for directing with both speed and efficiency. It never lets the constraints of technology slow it down	 in fact there is some creative things done to create the effect of flight	 including putting a camera on a boom on a truck and shooting high and traveling fast to make it look like we are seeing it from Superman's point of view	 also a few closeups of George in process work	 and a long shot of an animated Superman. <br /><br />This is now available on DVD as an extra feature on the first season of the George Reeves Television series. A DVD worth owning in its own right	 the inclusion of the film as its original whole	 is icing on the cake.<br /><br />Give Blood Today God Bless!"	1.0
"I had the pleasure of attending a screening of The Pacific and Eddy last weekend at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. This film had caught my attention a little while back when I stumbled across an article about it in Jalouse magazine. Seemed interesting at the time	 but nothing too exciting. Anyhow	 I saw it on the festival program and decided to check it out. All I can say is that I was speechless when the ending credits began to roll. This is one of the most beautiful and refreshing films that I have seen in some time. The photography	 art direction	 acting	 and especially directing	 were seamless and impeccable. Nothing is 'spelled out' for you in this film and actually makes you think. Something that a vast majority of films today do the exact opposite. The dialogue is carefully crafted and	 although this script is not wall to wall chatter	 the characters words are very deliberate and meaningful.<br /><br />It's definitely one of those films that deserves a second viewing and the more you see it	 the more things you notice. It's a very layered and intelligent film. Not sure when or where it's playing again	 but a definite must see for film enthusiasts."	1.0
"This movie surely has one of the strangest themes in history -- right up there with Ed Wood's impassioned defense of cross-dressing in ""Glen or Glenda?""<br /><br />The subject: playing bridge. The Park Avenue set plays it; the Bohemians play it. The Russians -- who speak very questionable ""Russian"" and have most unconvincing accents when they speak English -- play it at the restaurant where they work.<br /><br />If one isn't interested in bridge	 one -- even despite the great cast -- isn't likely to be much interested in this bizarre movie.<br /><br />Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are fine. (Well --Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghost writer -- as Lukas is an unlikely Russian.) But they are all sunk by the fetishistic script."	0.0

"The original ""Cube"" is a fantastic B-movie rich with paranoia	 meaty characterization	 and fine over-the-top performances. It's creepy	 cryptic	 and cool. And it stands perfectly well	 on its own	 without a stupid sequel like ""Cube Zero."" <br /><br />This third (!) film in the Cube series is part retread (most of the booby traps are sadly recycled)	 part aberration. It takes the bold step of explaining what the cube is - something that was never revealed in the first movie - but	 since said explanation is bland	 I'd rather it was kept a secret. There are some potentially interesting references to the society that exists outside of the cube	 but they never develop beyond hints about some kind of political-religious totalitarian state. So	 what little social commentary there is feels flat and unfocused.<br /><br />What works? Basically nothing. The acting is purely amateur hour	 the pacing is slow (how much of this movie consists of two nerds watching a screen?)	 and the gore effects	 while revolting	 fail to convince. In short	 ""Cube Zero"" reminded me of a ""Cube"" fan-fic	 a sloppy and sophomoric clone of a good movie that definitely did not need a sequel."	0.0
"I'm not at all picky about horror movies	 and I'm willing to watch pretty much any of them. That doesn't mean that I'm willing to re-watch many of them	 or that I won't have criticism for them.

In fact	 I think this movie would make an excellent double-bill with Session 9.<br /><br />I should specify	 before I get to my comments	 that I watched this alone. I started watching it before going to bed	 and got about 15 minutes in before I realized that it was too effective	 so I saved the rest of it for the morning.

This is much more important	 as it both sets the tone	 as well as explains much of the acting that permeates the movie.<br /><br />The couple is not doing well. The wife has distanced herself from the relationship	 and the husband is doing what he can to try to bring her back. While some of the comments have complained about their acting - one specified that they act more like a father and daughter than husband and wife	 and that's legitimate. He's trying to give her more direction. It's a role that men sometimes take on.<br /><br />There are a variety of scares in the film	 and most are fairly non-violent	 though grotesque in some ways. The story itself feels very straightforward for most of the film	 and takes an odd turn near the end. While the turn is not absurd	 it is certainly not what you expected from the way things had been progressing.<br /><br />Moody	 atmospheric	 and very well done for something that appears to have been shot on video."	1.0
"This was a painful example of a cheap	 boring and unoriginal show produced by Australian TV stations to fulfil local content quotas. The writing was truly terrible and I'm not surprised that the writers are those responsible for the worst Australian film in recent memory the Honerable Wally Norman.<br /><br />Nothing about this TV series was funny - ever - not even mildly amusing. It was just tired and BAD and	 worst of all	 it really thought it was funny. It was simply embarrassing to watch.<br /><br />There is something very suss about this show being given 10 out of 10 on IMDb. Try to find a (real) review by a (real) Australian viewer of the show (there weren't many) and it is impossible. Or crazy. There are loafs of bread that are funnier than this show. <br /><br />Avoid the show at all cost and if it does come out on DVD	 remember that the laughter THAT deserves was unintentional."	0.0
"This documentary explores a story covered in Pilger's latest book ""Freedom Next Time""	 which was published in 2006. It reveals the shocking expulsion of the natives of Diego Garcia	 one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean.<br /><br />The islanders are technically British citizens	 as Diego Garcia is a British colony	 much like Mauritius	 the nearby island to where the natives were exiled	 used to be. But the British government has ignored their pleas to return to their homeland	 as the island is now a military base for the United States army	 who have used it as a basis for the bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan.<br /><br />As usual	 Pilger's coverage is shocking	 especially as he documents the treatment and the current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders. His interviews all round are excellent	 and his cornering of a Parliament representative where he uses the Government's own information to pin him down	 ranks as one of his best.<br /><br />Pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of recently released documents that fully illuminate the British conspiracy to evict the natives. The weaving of this footage with the interviews	 and the islanders music	 really heightens the film's impact.<br /><br />It is not easy viewing	 but ""Stealing a Nation"" is John Pilger at his best. Recommended."	1.0

"I rented this film in DVD form without knowing anything at all about it	 part of a winter marathon of watching a film every night. After several awful American action adventure films (Ballistic	 Daredevil	 Cradle of Life) Zhu Warriors struck me as brilliantly original filmmaking. The story is complete nonsense	 but I found the film's sincerity	 good- heartedness and complete lack of irony refreshing	 and the film looks spectacular. Sure	 the special effects are not technically as flawless as those produced by Hollywood	 but the filmmakers wisely are more interested in color	 composition and movement than realism and so many of the shots are breathtaking. In one shot	 two of the superhuman characters stand on craggy spires of rock	 a huge moon rising before them	 the image perfectly balanced by the three elements. In another	 a princess-warrior spires through the heavens behind her glowing sword like a heat-seeking missile. And the colors explode from shot to shot	 used to express emotion rather than to represent reality.<br /><br />The characters have the same simplicity and directness of comic book characters	 offering no great depth in themselves but referring to archtypes that resonate more deeply. Physically	 several of the actors are astonishingly beautiful. They play their roles straight up	 without irony or guile	 and so are believable.<br /><br />Most strange of all	 despite the clumsiness of plot and thin characterizations	 I found myself very near tears at the end	 moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original	 good-hearted vision of the director.<br /><br />"	1.0
"This- and not a certain slightly overrated Southern Soap Opera-was the greatest epic to come out of Hollywoods greatest year	 1939.I will not not restate the obvious-Cary Grant	Victor McLaglen( who WAS a Bengal Lancer)	 and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. give superb comic performances.However	 I want to note two other	 less understood elements of this masterpiece. The Magnificent final battle sequence	 as the wonderful Sam Jaffe climbs laboriously up to the pinnacle of the temple to blow his bugle and warn the regiment	 is simply grand. It never fails to enthrall me. Yet another underrated element in the film is Eduardo Ciannelli's performance as the Guru. This is no Fu Manchu caricature	 but an well drawn	 articulate	 historically informed ( ""Have you ever heard of Changruputra Maurya?He defeated the armies left in India by Alexander The Great"")villain. Indeed	 one can see parallels between this mystical	 evil nationalist and a certain well known figure of the thirties( A German	 not an Indian). Gunga Din	 anti-Nazi tract? Not quite. But still	 a tremendous	 funny	 moving epic."	1.0
"The most agile fat guy in martial arts does it again. An early Sammo film that has him imitating his character's hero	 Bruce Lee	 Sammo is amazingly Lee like in his actions and fighting. The way he slips into Bruce's style and then back to his own	 more familiar kung fu is a joy to watch and shows how accomplished and adaptable he is at his art. Throw in a bit of slapstick humour so beloved of this type of flick and this a movie that has it all - comedy (some unintentional	 like the fake black guy)	 action and some incredible fight scenes.<br /><br />A great beer and buddies movie that is worth an hour and a half of anyone's time."	1.0
"Composed	 elegant Carol (marvelously played by the beautiful Rebecca Brooke)	 her nice husband Eddie (likable David Houseman)	 Carol's wacky	 constantly eating best gal pal Anna (delightfully essayed with infectious comic zeal by the adorable Chris Jordan)	 and Anna's hunky	 amorous husband Pete (a typically fine Eric Edwards) are a quartet of liberated swingers who enjoy having frequent group sex with each other. Their usual routine gets disrupted when Carol's lonely	 repressed	 but still alluring widow mother Jennifer (a superbly moving performance by the lovely Jennifer Welles) drops by for a visit. Pretty soon Jennifer loosens up and becomes a willing participant in the swingers' blithely pleasurable and uninhibited carnal lifestyle	 with everyone except Carol eager to seduce her. Writer/director Joe Sarno concocts a sharp	 engrossing and perceptive examination of suburban angst and the limitations of the whole wild'n'easy 70's sexual revolution; Sarno turns traditional middle class mores on their heads and further spices things up with a bold and provocative mother/daughter incest subplot. Moreover	 Sarno elicits uniformly first-rate acting from the bang-up cast: Welles and Brooke are both exceptional	 with excellent support from Edwards	 Jordan	 Houseman	 Arlana Blue as flaky New Age sex therapist Shandara	 and Erica Eaton as saucy neighbor Mrs. Fields. Better still	 all the women are extremely hot and enticing; Welles in particular seriously steams up the screen with her exquisitely voluptuous figure and smoldering erotic presence. The sex scenes are really sizzling and fairly explicit	 but never raunchy or tedious. Stephen Colwell's bright	 polished cinematography and Jack Justis' bouncy	 melodic acoustic folk score are both on the money solid and effective. Recommended viewing for Sarno fans."	1.0
"Take one look at the cover of this movie	 and you know right away that you are not about to watch a landmark film. This is cheese filmmaking in every respect	 but it does have its moments. Despite the look of utter trash that the movie gives	 the story is actually interesting at some points	 although it is undeniably pulled along mainly by the cheerleading squads' shower scenes and sex scenes with numerous personality-free boyfriends. The acting is awful and the director did little more than point and shoot	 which is why the extensive amount of nudity was needed to keep the audience's attention.<br /><br />In The Nutty Professor	 a hopelessly geeky professor discovers a potion that can turn him into a cool and stylish womanizer	 whereas in The Invisible Maniac	 a mentally damaged professor discovers a potion that can make him invisible	 allowing him to spy on (and kill	 for some reason) his students. Boring fodder. Don't expect any kind of mental stimulation from this	 and prepare yourself for shrill and enormously overdone maniacal laughter which gets real annoying real quick..."	0.0
"Who wrote this? Some guy named John Cohen. I guess this was the first screenplay he's ever worked on. Someone should've told him you're supposed to write dialog that sounds like something someone actually might say.<br /><br />And who directed this? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerry Marshall. My the nut has fallen far from the tree. Someone might have wanted to let him know that you can	 in fact	 shoot a scene in a cab in New York	 and it will look real	 and you won't have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason. Might have also wanted to let him know he should stay away from Jessica Simpson	 but hopefully he's learned that lesson now.<br /><br />And Jessica Simpson... naturally she can't act. Hell	 she makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn	 and yet she's starring in this movie. OH wait	 it was produced by her father. Okay	 that's why she got the part. That's really the only reason I can think of.<br /><br />So should I be surprised it's bad? No. Should I be amazed at how bad it is? I think a lot of people would if they saw as much of it as I did. I mean you expect a movie starring Jessica Simpson to be bad	 but this... it's not just bad	 it's the complete opposite of a classic film. Think of a great Woody Allen movie	 this film is as bad as that film is good. It's the Anti-Annie Hall.<br /><br />I am so glad I didn't pay to see it	 I stopped watching ten minutes in cus I couldn't go on. No doubt I would've walked out of the theater sooner. In fact I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it per theater actually stayed and watched the whole thing. The film starts out laughably bad	 and then goes to the point of being so bad it becomes a kind of Chinese water torture. And then	 around when the first act is ending	 you realize it'll only get worse	 and that's when you either need to leave	 or kill yourself.<br /><br />In conclusion	 this film goes under the category of being so bad it should be used in place of water boarding at Guantanamo Bay. Although some prefer the water boarding."	0.0
"This movie was horrible. I swear they didn't even write a script they just kinda winged it through out the whole movie. Ice-T was annoying as hell. *SPOILERS Phht more like reasons not to watch it* They sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes. he coulda been long gone. The ground was hard it would of been close to impossible to to track him with out dogs. And when ICE-T is on that Hill and uses that Spaz-15 Assault SHOTGUN like its a sniper rifle (and then cuts down a tree with eight shells?? It would take 1000's of shells to cut down a tree that size.) Shotguns and hand guns are considered to be inaccurate at 100yards. And they even saw the reflection. What reflected the light?? I didn't see a scope on that thing. Also when he got shot in the gut and kept going	 that was retarded he would of bled to death right there. PlusThe ending where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the guys barrel. It wouldn't blow up and kill him. The bullet would still fire kill Ice T but mess up the barrel."	0.0
"This is not a boring movie	 the audience might stay on its chair fascinated by this selfish character	 Miles Berkowitz	 both film-maker and actor here. The storyline is simple : after a divorce and ten years of a hollywoodian non-career	 the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera. The first question is about how true is all that : what is written	 what came by chance ? Both answers	 ""yes"" or ""no"" portrays M.Berkowitz as a low average human beeing. If you look for a self-fiction about love like this one	 I recommand you to read some independant comic books : Chester Brown	 Joe Matt...<br /><br />Beside of this	 I felt quite disappointed to hear so much against my country	 France. I know american people usually say that the french are arrogant (that might be true then)	 etc.	 and for sure the french (and the whole world) have lots of griefs against america	 but why so much hate ? Don't think I couldn't like this movie only because of that anyhow."	0.0
"Next to ""Star Wars"" and ""The Wizard of Oz	"" this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. It's a true shame it's not as well-known as the former films (maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or sci-fi settings	 and that it's British	 meaning a smaller market for films) but its wonderful to know that it's deserved that reputation.<br /><br />Like all great family films	 one can be a child	 an adult	 or even a teenager to enjoy this film (I'm currently 18)	 but one must appreciate classic films first. I absolutely adore this film. It has an extraordinary music score by Miklos Rozsa (perhaps my favorite classic film score) that rivals any John Williams ""Star Wars"" score	 a fast but not flashy pace	 beautiful sets	 dialog	 and use of color (both the sets and cinematography won Oscars)	 and state-of-the-art Oscar-winning special effects (for the time	 and some are still stunning). And	 of course	 June Duprez's sultry looks as the Princess rivals that of Catherine Zeta-Jones' (she even looks like Jones in a way!).<br /><br />In conclusion	 this is one of my all-time favorite movie (next to ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"") and it truly deserves more attention. It is a true adventure of enchantment throughout	 and	 along with ""Robin Hood	"" it's my desert island film that I could watch over and over again without getting annoyed.<br /><br />Stars: **** (excellent)"	1.0
"Well	 I'll be honest: It is not exactly a Sholay. But you cant get a Sholay every week. In fact	 you could see distinct signatures of ""not without my Daughter""(Sally Field	 1991) in this movie. However	 as most ""inspired"" movies go	 this one was a well-inspired one	 well handled and well done. Nana Patekar	 as usual	 tends to overdo his hysterics	 but all others are commendable. Specially so about Dipti Naval: Saw her after a long time	 but she hasn't lost any of her grace. In fact	 she has performed much better that when I last saw her. Another one of the Bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age?<br /><br />All in all	 a nice watch."	1.0
"Dreamgirls	 despite its fistful of Tony wins in an incredibly weak year on Broadway	 has never been what one would call a jewel in the crown of stage musicals. However	 that is not to say that in the right cinematic hands it could not be fleshed out and polished into something worthwhile on-screen. Unfortunately	 what transfers to the screen is basically a slavishly faithful version of the stage hit with all of its inherent weaknesses intact. First	 the score has never been one of the strong points of this production and the film does not change that factor. There are lots of songs (perhaps too many?)	 but few of them are especially memorable. The closest any come to catchy tunes are the title song and One Night Only - the much acclaimed And I Am Telling You That I Am Not Going is less a great song than it is a dramatic set piece for the character of Effie (Jennifer Hudson). The film is slick and technically well-produced	 but the story and characters are surprisingly thin and lacking in any resonance. There is some interest in the opening moments	 watching Jamie Foxx's Svengali-like manager manipulate his acts to the top	 but that takes a back seat in the latter portion of the film	 when the story conveniently tries to cast him as a villain	 despite his having been right from a business stand-point for a good majority of the film. Beyonce Knowles is lovely and sings her songs perfectly well	 but is stuck with a character who is basically all surface glitz. Anika Noni Rose as the third member of the Dreamgirls trio literally has nothing to do for the entire film. Eddie Murphy acquits himself well as a singer obviously based on James Brown	 but the role is not especially meaty and ultimately has little impact. Foxx would seem ideal casting	 but he seems oddly withdrawn and bored. The film's biggest selling point is surely former American Idol contestant/Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson in the central role of Effie White	 the temperamental singer who gets booted from the group and makes a triumphant closing act return. For me	 Effie has always been a big problem in both the show and the movie. The film obviously wants you to feel sorry for her and rather ham-handedly takes her side	 but I have never been sure that this character deserves that kind of devotion. From the start	 Effie conducts herself for the most part like an obnoxious	 egotistical	 self-centered diva	 who is more interested in what everyone else can do for her rather than having much vested interest in the group of which she is a part. When she is booted from the group for her unprofessionalism and bad attitude	 the charges are more than well-founded	 but the stage show/film seem to think Effie should be cut unlimited slack simply because she has a great voice. Even though the film tries to soften some of Effie's harder edges to make her more likable	 the charges still stand. Her story becomes more manipulative by suggesting she should have our further sympathy because she is an unwed mother struggling to raise her daughter - using the implication that (much like the talent card) motherhood immediately makes any behavior excusable. Indeed the only big effort the film makes to show Effie's mothering is to tell us about it and then include a scene where she barks at her daughter in the unemployment office	 insists that the girl has ""no father"" and then refuse to look for gainful employment to support them since singing is all she knows. In the hands of a skillful actress	 the gaps could perhaps have been remedied with technique and charisma. Unfortunately	 Hudson is not that actress. She sings well	 but the dialog-driven moments do not come naturally to her nor do high emotional moments. Effie's signature moment (the aforementioned And I Am Telling You... number) is well-sung by Hudson	 but emotionally flat in the acting department. Effie is supposed to expressing her rage and desperation at her predicament	 but Hudson comes off as a cabaret performer belting out a hot number. All in all	 not quite the emotional highlight one expects. The latter portion of the film is basically a predictable melange of events that maneuver Foxx into Hudson's earlier position and allow her to strut back in and lord it over everyone. Foxx's criminal offenses in the film are undoubtedly par for the course of many struggling record producers	 but the film's seeming implication that he has it coming because he helped usher in the disco era is rather ridiculous	 not to mention pretentious and condescending	 particularly coming from a film with all of the depth of a puddle. The end result is a faithful rendition of the stage hit	 drained of emotion	 energy or anything that can be described as dynamic."	0.0

"The name of Nick Stahl	 the young cast and the attractive cover of the VHS made me buy and watch this flick	 expecting to see a good teen slash movie. What a crap! The full of clichés screenplay	 the dialogs and the performances are awful	 dreadful	 very bad	 terrible	 horrendous  summarizing	 a complete waste of time. There is no horror	 black humor	 only an absolutely boring story	 with shameful plot points. The film begins with six characters	 indeed three couples	 together like a group of friends	 but indeed very nasty persons that seems to be enemies	 playing a ridiculous senseless game called ""Taboo""	 and with each one of them writing yes or no for certain taboo issues. That is it: no previous development of the characters	 the viewer does not know who they are	 their motives and relationship. Then	 there is an ellipsis to one year later	 and the same group is gathered together in a New Years Eve party	 insulting each other in a very sordid way. But the plot and the twists are so ridiculous	 predictable	 mediocre and unbelievable that do not deserve any additional line in my review. One advice only: do not waste your time or money on this garbage	 you will certainly regret. My vote is one (awful).<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Taboo  Jogando Com o Assassino"" (""Taboo  Playing With the Killer"")"	0.0

"It is no wonder this movie won 4 prices	 it is a movie that lingers to any soul	 it isn't a wonder why it took Paul Reiser 20 years to finally give in and talk to Peter Falk about his idea. I can understand every part of it	 this is a movie that will make you cry just a tear	 or thousands.<br /><br />Story: 10/10 When Sam kleinman gets a letter from his wife about her leaving him to find something else his son and him take out on a road trip to find her	 and while they do that they find something lost	 Friendship	 family	 and affection for each other. At the beginning you know whats going to happen	 but none soever the story is not that easy to figure out from beginning to end	 it is a ride between a father and his son	 and a husband and his wife. It is no wonder it took Paul Reiser 20 years to write this beautiful romance/comedy.<br /><br />Actors: 10/10 Well you cant say anything else that what i about to say	 hey it is with Peter Falk in it	 he is a legend everything he does in movies are magic	 when you use Peter Falk in a romance/comedy what do you think you get? A perfect outcome	 it is no wonder this movie is that perfect and won that many prices. As the son Paul Reiser does an excellent job	 although he isn't a great actor always that doesn't mean that this didn't work actually Peter Falk and Paul Reiser plays the perfect Father and Son	 the rest of the cast is good enough but you don't see them as much so just say they do what they shall to get this to shine even more. <br /><br />Music: 10/10 It doesn't always work when using music sometimes it just doesn't fit but that is not the thing in this movie	 the music is perfect in tune	 it makes the movie even more compelling. This part of the movie will shine off as good as the other parts	 a great soundtrack for a Romance/Comedy thats for sure.<br /><br />Overall: 10/10 There are so many Romance/Comedy movies out on tapes	 DVDs	 Blu-ray and what not	 but this movie is one of the special ones. it doesn't happen everyday that you can create a story like this	 it takes years thinking about this and the fact is that actually what it took to make it	 a great piece that should be bought and kept into the human soul	 see it when you get old and see it with your father at a old age	 i think then this movie will spark like no other ever made."	1.0

When will people wake up and see that u will never ever find the real truth about 2pac and Biggie... Its all covered up and buried deep down.<br /><br />Second	 I'm not against neither 2pac or Biggie I love them both but 2pac and Lil Kim DID get embarrassed in this movie for sure...<br /><br />Next	 for all of ya that are saying that the movie is awesome and cant see the truth	 either u are too blind too see it because u think u know something about BIG or you don't know anything about him at all and u love this Hollywood teenage movies. Use your mind and see though the clouds... There is a lot of it you could say when it gets to this topic	 I did not say 60% of what I have to say because its a very wide topic but for the movie I can only say that it could have been a little bit	 I mean a much better done. But anyways I'm just some person giving her opinion....No hard feelings...<br /><br />Look	 I love hip hop and I live for it but after seeing this movie every person with a little intelligence could see that this is not how someone is suppose to live. With all do respect for 2pac and BIG	 like all the other artists who are making for a living like this should turn the other page because u are ruining the youth....Bringing the wrong message to the children and that is: not going to school but living from the streets	 hustling and just grabbing for the paper....<br /><br />The true hip hop is suppose to be about love and intelligence	 be smart and all.<br /><br />OK I know that many of you will think that I'm crazy	 but this is just my point of view. Look I am maybe wrong about something and Im not saying this is a completely bad movie because even if I'm in hip hop for 17	 18 years I still don't know anything bout 2pac or Biggie no matter how many articles I read or how much I support them and listen to their music...Like most of you all out there. Only people who were really close to them and the killers know the truth behind all this.<br /><br />And for the end I just wanna say for all of ya Biggie and Tupac fans and family	 this two men were and will be the greatest of all time	 no matter how they lived their lives but PLEASE IN THE FUTURE TRY TO BE BETTER	 LEARN AND LOVE EACH OTHER	 THINK GOOD EVEN FOR THE ONES THAT Don't LIKE YOU	 BECAUSE AT THE END...ITS NOT ABOUT HOW MANY MONEY OR FAME U COULD GET AND HOW FAST U COULD GET TO THE TOP	 ITS ABOUT ACCOMPLISHING YOUR SELF TO THE FULLEST AND FEEDING YOUR SOUL	 YOUR BODY AND MIND...BECAUSE IF U MANAGE TO DO THAT	 YOU WILL BE LIVING A LIFE EVEN AFTER DEATH!!!!

"The original movie	 Man From Snowy River	 is one of the best I've seen	 nearly perfect. A Lady and the Tramp storyline in two senses--rich girl/poor boy	 and ability vs. bloodline. The sequel	 however	 is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original but also a ridiculous	 overblown Disneyfied mess best summarized as ""Rambo Meets the Black Stallion."" Without the charm of The Black Stallion. The young hero comes back from a 3-year absence	 and suddenly he's Superman on horseback; in the original	 good film	 he was real and believable	 but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel. I've hardly been as disappointed in a movie	 and at times this thing made me quite angry--they missed hardly a cliché. Brazen audience manipulation--do studio heads think that all you have to do with a horse-loving audience is put pretty horses in front of them	 to make them happy? A mess of a movie."	0.0
"As an impressionable 10 year old	 I liked the ""love conquers all"" philosophy of the 70s sitcom ""Bridget Loves Bernie."" I did understand the controversy	 which was about the romantic complications between a Jewish cab driver (David Birney) and an Irish Catholic school teacher (Meredith Baxter) and both sets of parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernie's parents; Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget's parents) who have issues with the young couple's interfaith marriage.<br /><br />Looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences	 I am amazed that the show was even a success for one	 albeit	 highly-rated season. Created by veteran TV writer Bernard Slade	 who a few years after the show's cancellation would write the successful play ""Same Time	 Next Year""	 ""Bridget Loves Bernie"" was a very light	 superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weight.<br /><br />There was no denying the real-life chemistry between Birney and Baxter. But	 in later years	 both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects (Birney in his short-lived role in ""St. Elsewhere"" and Baxter in ""Family"" and ""Family Ties""). Here	 they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much gritter comic edge	 which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subject.<br /><br />The show aired Saturday nights between two CBS powerhouses: ""All in the Family"" and ""Mary Tyler Moore"". Both of those shows were smart	 funny and had enough of an edge (more so on the former that the latter) that kept my interest in the situation and the characters. ""Bridget Loves Bernie"" was not very smart and only had some occasional chuckles.<br /><br />This was another example of a show that really was not as good as I remembered."	0.0
"""Cut"" is a film about some film students making a film. It's very much in the ""Scream"" mold	 an ironic	 self-referential horror flick which	 for me at least	 falls down because for all its irony	 it's still just a bad horror film	 same as the films its referring to.<br /><br />But it was not without its charms. Well	 one charm anyway. Molly Ringwald was fantastic as the spoilt	 bitchy American actress hating every minute of working with the amateur Australian film crew. She was so convincing that its tempting to believe it wasn't an act	 although everyone involved with ""Cut"" says she was lovely to work with. :-)<br /><br />Seriously	 every scene of her pouting	 sulking or snapping was great. Everyone else	 however	 wavered between being OK and being terribly wooden.<br /><br />Anyway	 ""Cut"" has some laughs	 a few buckets of gore (some of it surprisingly gruesome)	 and ultimately is.. just another bad horror film."	0.0
"This is just the best movie of all times! Sorry	 Hollywood!

What makes this masterpiece of Danelia so special? It's difficult to say	 as it is difficult to describe what the beauty is... But the fact is that you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure as it was the first time.

"Beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature. Forbidden Lie$(2007) is simply a better (cinematic) version of Norma Khouri's book Forbidden Love	 and THAT was a best-seller. An onion-peeling of literary fraud and of a pretty woman	 Lie$ is the very best in editorialised reality TV.<br /><br />Cleverly edited and colourful	 Broinowski's storytelling is chaptered by moving silhouettes of Norma Khouri meaningfully blowing smoke. I disagree (with Variety) that it's overlong; instead my one slight problem was with the episodic nature of its key players commenting on others' just-recorded testimonials. On a single watching your sense of narrative becomes mired.....so I watched it twice.<br /><br />This Oscar-worthy effort is at once genuinely funny	 upsetting	 and totally engrossing as it documents one lie after another. The apparent con unfolded in the Australian State of Queensland via very personal swindles of Khouri's friends and fans(!). Clearly these friends are now ""turned""	 the funniest on-camera line belonging to Khouri's QLD neighbour Rachel Richardson who speaks her disillusionment in flat	 no-nonsense colloquialisms: ""I think it's a load of sh!t. Personally"".<br /><br />We need to learn from their experience	 hence my belief in spoilers. Any perennial lie-spinner caught out in a lie will just say anything to buy time to tell another lie. <br /><br />There's some breathtaking footage of Khouri cackling derisively at duping this very documentarian	 who instead presses her (con)""Artist"" repeatedly for corroboration.<br /><br />Since being busted by Sydney Morning Herald journalists Caroline Overington and David Knox a year after publication	 Khouri has been on the run	 but was tempted back to the director to supposedly clear her name. She absconded supposedly because a) she's either terrified of her sly	 more-Italian-sounding-than-Greek husband	 or b) because she needed her passport/visas to clear her name. <br /><br />Unlikely.<br /><br />A more plausible reason was that the FBI regained her trail in Queensland before she again skipped overseas (one guess: No	 not Jordan). According to a closing card	 Khouri is ""still under investigation by the FBI"" in 2007.<br /><br />I guessed audiences might just give Khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need for utmost secrecy and subterfuge. Instead	 the audiences I sat with slowly became just as disillusioned as the duped people on the screen. Once they caught on	 there was plenty counter-derision and catcalls; earlier	 stressed sighs had emanated from audiencemembers who just didn't know how to take Khouri's evolving contradictions.<br /><br />The filmmaker gets props for so beautifully spanning this convoluted tale from beginning to end	 not leaving anything out--not even her own self-sacrifice.<br /><br />Anna opens her film with a sympathetic book narration by Khouri herself. The putated reason for authoring it is retold very believably at first--key to how a lifelong liar operates: in half-truths. Khouri is nevertheless a very pretty and smart 35yr-old with rather disarming charm	 and surprisingly	 worked-out biceps.<br /><br />Gradually we're introduced to less-and-less-adulating Aussie journos	 publishers and fans who at first bought the extent of Khouri's honour-killing accusations hook	 line and sinker. Later we see their more rueful reactions	 quite self-controlled and matter-of-fact	 if some perhaps a little bitter.<br /><br />It was Jordanian (anti-)honour-killing activists who took deepest umbrage at Khouri's fallacies because its pot-stirring forced them to reduce the pace of change. Honour-killings do happen in Jordan; it's just their prevalence that's at odds with Khouri's book--plus 72 other ""facts"". In 2003 these activists faxed (Australian) Random House with 73 painstakingly-checked objections.<br /><br />The publishing houses across 4 continents who'd jumped at the chance to publish first-time author Khouri never tried to check any facts. Leaving any corroborration to a disclaimer in their author contract	 they too were fair game. So a massive hot-topic fraud was as easy to perpetrate upon the world as typing it up in Internet cafes.<br /><br />Later still we're shocked to discover that the ""factual errors"" extend to Khouri's bio as well. For one thing	 she's not only not a 35yr-old virgin (her defence is that she merely didn't disabuse people of their assumptions)	 but she has a slickster husband and 2 teenagers! Sometimes she's just too fast-talking in her American accent. She also seems too-comfortable with cellphone technology and Western clothes. I realise observations like these might sound prejudicial to the very Jordanian women who don't need any Western paternalism from me	 but when even cultural cues don't jibe in addition to Khouri's ""facts""	 you've got to start questioning your source.<br /><br />At some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion. She makes an admirable effort to hold Khouri to account	 in person	 in Jordan. The last third is consumed with a fact-finding trip back to Amman	 where one ""fact"" after another falls. Eventually Broinowski forces her (con)""Artist"" to admit the decade-discrepancy in her story	 and it's after this that Khouri records her derisive secret confession into her own digital camera. Secret	 because in it Khouri's ""American security guard"" Jeremy is heard to have an Australian accent: he's an actor! (We never find out how Anna uncovered it.) <br /><br />So this becomes the filmmaker's triumph	 as she never flags in her tone or commitment. Her on-camera revelations lead her audience to learn from the mistakes of others given such a litany of reasonable doubt	 FBI documents--and Khouri's most shocking initial crime.<br /><br />Anna Broinowski (watch-list her now) is even clever enough to use the one artistic device (key players cross-commenting on footage) to kill two birds--making her audiences want to drink from the same well again.<br /><br />In fact	 despite her deceptively demure approach	 she made me re-confirm that Overington and Knox really DID win their 2004 Walkleys in Investigate Journalism for their ""Norma Khouri Investigation"".<br /><br />Broinowski MADE ME LOOK.(10/10)"	1.0
"I don't know why people always want deeper meaning in movies or else consider them worthless.<br /><br />What about just being entertained? Something at which Morgan Freeman excels. He gets a chance to show off a bit. Paz Vega	 his co-star	 gets a career boost and Brad Silberling gets a name to draw people into watching his movie.<br /><br />I thought it was a good movie. Some humor	 some pathos	 some bittersweetness but nothing over the top. I got an especial kick out of Jim Parsons as the receptionist at a construction company. When he looks at Freeman adoringly and says	 ""You make me want to be a woman."" He's just hilarious. The fight scene between Ms. Vega her ex-husband and his girlfriend is wonderful too.<br /><br />In short	 it's a cute	 charming film that will make you smile. You could do much	 much worse."	1.0
"While Urban Cowboy did not ooze with the same testosterone you might find at a rodeo	 it did provide an accurate glimpse of that day and age	 in urban Texas. I also think that to truly critique this movie	 one would have to have lived in the time and relative place that it was made. There was good music	 fun times and	 yes	 a few ""rough and tumbles"" at the honky tonk roadhouses. The relationship of Bud and Sissy	 like ""two ships passing in the night""	 was well conceived. When Pam tore up the note that Sissy had written to Bud	 it echoed the tragedy of many true life romances. The entire story was well thought out. I thought the cast and crew did an excellent job. I thought the screen play was well written and directed. Scott Glenn should have received an Oscar for best supporting actor."	1.0
"Very low-budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in Central Park	 and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm. Although released by RKO	 this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution. The cast and crew	 with a few exceptions--among them a young and uncredited Jack Lord	 director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner--are comprised of complete unknowns	 and it shows. The performances are universally sub-par and wouldn't pass muster in a high school training film	 the direction is stodgy and choppy and	 as mentioned previously	 there's no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors. However	 despite the film's many shortcomings	 it does have a few good points. The location shooting in New York City	 and the film's ultra-low budget	 gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior ""The Naked City""	 a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled	 and some of the investigating procedures are clever. Otherwise	 it's not much to write home about. It is worth a look	 however	 for a glimpse at the seamier sections of New York City in the early 1950s	 and old-car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of '30s and '40s cars in the streets.<br /><br />."	0.0
"""Home Room"" like ""Zero Day"" and ""Elephant""	 was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings. But unlike the other two films	 ""Home Room"" focuses on two survivors (not the shooters or those killed) in the aftermath of a shooting. Making it less exploitive and more useful because little effort is wasted in asking questions for which there are no answers.<br /><br />Don't give up on this little film during the first 20 minutes	 it is supposed to set up the real story but plays like a rejected ""Hill Street Blues"" episode. It is lame but bear with it	 at least it pads the running length enough to get the film classified as a feature. I recommend skipping this entirely and just jumping ahead to the hospital scenes-there is nothing here that you can't pick up from the remainder of the film.<br /><br />Like a lot of good little films this was creatively a one-man show as Paul F. Ryan was both the writer and the director. While this arrangement does not guarantee a good film	 it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution that is often lacking in big budget dramatic features. Because the script of ""Home Room"" is its real strength it is fortunate that the writer also executed the production and insured that his vision made it onto the screen.<br /><br />Ryan takes a huge chance with the ending which tests the limits of the average viewer's sentimentality tolerance. He runs it right up to the edge but against all logic leaves you crying instead of cringing. Why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey	 the song (Sarah McLaughlin's ""Sweet Surrender"") he goes out on	 and the amazing editing of the final minute.<br /><br />The other strength of the film is the casting of Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Deanna) as the main protagonists. Although Phillips plays her standard alienated surly teen and Christensen her intelligent daughter of a good family	 they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before. The family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to Ryan. What is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie Alicia to the lone shooter. If they ever re-cut and trim the film this side story should be condensed.<br /><br />A story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and Ryan could have easily steered this film into cliché and predictability. But instead his script has them engaging in a fascinating and convincing sparring match	 slowly chipping away at each other and sharing moments of vulnerability	 only to retreat back inside themselves. Deanna's ""I'm dying inside"" line just tears you apart-I can't think of a moment in any other film that I felt as intensely as that one. She desperately needs a connection that Alicia just as desperately resists. Deanna only makes progress when she retreats. The viewer keeps expecting the group hug that never seems to happen.<br /><br />Ultimately this not only generates a lot of suspense but leaves you admiring both characters and the two actresses who brought them to life.<br /><br />Then again	 what do I know? I'm only a child."	1.0
"<br /><br />Artisticly shot	 actors portray exactly their role. You get a real feeling watching Lucienne ascend from poverty to the most beautiful girl around. A sense of tragedy to triumph to tragedy again. All in all I have seen this film at least 10 times. And can VERY well say that Prix De Beute' (the Beauty Prize	 Miss Europe) is a MAJOR favorite in my silent film collection. The expressiveness of Louise Brooks is perfect and I recommend this film to ANYONE who appreciates artistic beauty coupled with a tragic story line."	1.0
"This movie sucks ass. Something about a heatwave in some European country	 complete trash. There's nothing going for this movie whatsoever. maybe 30 seconds of sex but that's it. There is a very annoying chick who hitches rides with people and really pisses me off. This movie is complete rash and you shouldn't subject yourself to watching it. I regret it it's very boring. I would rate it zero but i can't. No body in their right mind should see this. i'm sure you'll regret it completely i did. How could they think up something this bad. Even Mystery men was better. MYSTERY MEN. That sucks. That movie wasn't worth being made. complete waste of time. The characters in this are very hard to understand and i good very very very bored."	0.0
"Rather than move linearly from beginning to end	 this story line of a gay couple impacted by AIDS ""orbits"" in time around their ""perfect day."" The film is organized as a life remembered in asynchronous fragments rather than in a sequential flow as one directly experienced.<br /><br />The narration has its lyrical moments	 particularly in describing the impact of loss anticipated or experienced. The dialog unfortunately lacks such grace. The script frequently compels the actors to say startlingly stupid or insensitive things that seem utterly out of character at the moment. On their second accidental encounter	 clearly smitten with each other	 sensitive Phillip encourages a reluctant Guy to tell him about his difficult week. But the moment Guy begins to open up	 Phillip	 an English Major	 blurts out ""You're not a Crisis Fairy	 are you?"" Later	 watching his lover's naked	 chiseled body stride across the bedroom toward him	 our young Shakespeare in love begins to render the beauty of the moment in words	 ""The way you cut through space....I can't even describe it""--but lacks the verbal skills to complete his thought. This kind of drivel continues through the AIDS Hospice scenes	 bejeweled with lines like	 ""What made me think death would be all neat and tied up with ribbons?"" and ""You make Florence Nightingale look like Nurse Ratchet."" <br /><br />The film often suffers from a bruising lack of subtlety. Unlikable characters are far more jarring and steamroller-flattened than they need to be. Phillip's thoroughly annoying friends--an arrogant trust fund brat and a whining	 needy dweeb--maintain a running caustic diatribe about every one crossing their path. Such patter could offer a writer a wealth of opportunities for clever social commentary	 but sadly	 their remarks are merely unpleasant	 ungraced by wit or insight. It's hard to know if our scriptwriter intentionally crafted intellectually limited characters or if he was simply running his tether's perimeter.<br /><br />The plot may be what most appeals to and resonates with those who praise this film. It does seriously explore 1980's US middle class gay life: first encounters	 courting	 coupling	 nesting	 the complexity of open relationships	 friction and fracturing	 dissolution	 physical abuse	 rapprochement	 forgiveness	 terminal illness	 death and survival. Leads Phelan and Spirtas give fair to good performances rendering complex characters over time. Their fetching good looks help explain both the chemistry that held these two together through insensitivity and selfishness as well as the chemistry that helped some some viewers overlook this film's painful weaknesses. The decision to chop the plot arc into tidbits and present them in out-of-sequence flashbacks added complexity without any evident dramatic utility	 and in several cases left the sequence and thus the implications of a given event unclear.<br /><br />Could I recommend the film? To sticklers for literary and technical quality	 absolutely not! For easy going viewers in serious need of an AIDS survivor catharsis or in the mood for a guilty-pleasure tearjerker with a little eye candy thrown in	 maybe. But better written alternatives exploring the impact of AIDS on relationships of that era include: Philadelphia	 And the band played on	 Longtime companion	 Angels in America	 An early frost	 Parting glances	 Love! Valour! Compassion! and even Jeffrey."	0.0

"Millie is a sap. She marries a rich guy named Maitland and they have a child. She then catches him cheating on her and divorces him...but lets him keep the kid she claims to love. Back then in the early 1930s	 she would have been entitled to hefty spousal and child support but lets the guy off amazingly easy...with no support...what a sap! Later	 when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good	 he turns out to ALSO be a cheat! Wow	 does she have a hard time picking men.<br /><br />As a result of these bad relationships	 Millie changes. Now she's a wild party girl--doing everything she can to distract herself from her hard luck. Suddenly	 many years pass. Millie's daughter who she left early on in the film is now 17 and oddly fashions haven't changed one bit. An old friend of Millie's (yes	 it's another evil man!) is now pretending to be the daughter's friend	 but he has lecherous designs on her. Millie promises him that if he touches the girl	 she'll kill him. Take a wild guess what happens next! <br /><br />Overall	 the film is a confusing and often bizarre mess--a bit like ""Madam X"" but much	 much less focused. So often Millie's motivations and actions seem to make little sense. And	 the film seems to have a little of everything tossed into it--so long as it substantiates the notion that all men are pigs.

"while being one of the ""stars"" of this film doesn't necessarily give me sage insight	 i do know quite a bit of what was first there...and what ended up on the screen. i remember seeing the original cut of ""incoming freshman"" and being very pleased. it was funny	 sexy	 raunchy	 all the main requirements of a drive-in film. you have to remember this was shot and released before all the rest...animal house	 porky's	 etc...so in its own way	 this flick was truly ahead of its time. for whatever reasons	 the film was given to the main distributors who editing out half the original film	 and then edited in (should i say ""shuffled?"")

"This movie introduces quite an array of characters and their relationships in the first half-hour or so. None of them generate any interest or positive response.

To me the action isn't worth recounting. Not that the story was that bad	 I guess you could say I had some problems with the script--i.e. I thought it stunk. A look at the credits will show you that there's a pretty strong cast here	 used to no avail.

"Everything a musical comedy should be. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) doesn't miss a step	 and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) doesn't miss a note. Scenes with them together are very good	 showing how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven plot. Sinatra's ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" is an indication of his then and future best. Kelly's ""Mexican Hat Dance"" with a young Mexican girl is delightful. Kelly certainly earned his nomination as Best Actor. And there is a bushel of truly funny lines	 like: ""You think the navy takes dopes?""; ""You think anybody sings a sailor to sleep?""; and	 ""We got in a little trouble	 we picked up a little kid.""

"Just saw the World Preem of Fido at the Toronto International Film Festival and thoroughly enjoyed it. Here we have a welcome reworking of a genre widely thought to have been pioneered (certainly 'fleshed out' extensively and successfully) by George Romero. But this is a Canadian film by a Canadian Director and it's a Comedy! And	 YES	 I actually think it is better than 'Shawn of the Dead'. Thoroughly believable and	 perhaps even more importantly	 enjoyable performances by Dylan Baker	 Carrie-Anne Moss and young actor K'Sun Ray	 whom I suspect we'll be seeing a lot more of in future features. However	 I must confess that I most enjoyed the delicious turn by Tim Blake Nelson as neighbour Mr. Theopolis	 essentially playing a willing animated version of Victor Van Dort from the Corpse Bride (or	 for those who've seen the film	 wouldn't that read even better here as the Corpse Pride?) and	 of course	 Scotch actor Billy Connolly in his least animated	 yet somehow deeply moving role as the titular character. Just think	 he would not have gotten this role had it not been for Peter Stormare's commitments to Prison Break (as was revealed in the Q&A following Thursday night's screening). I can't help but speculate that the Screenwriters must have drawn a lot of inspiration from Day Of The Dead's Zombie 'Bub'.I am not keen on ever revealing plot details during a Comment and I won't start now. Suffice it to say that Fido is NOT one of those dour	 graphically gory Zombie films you can rely on from Romero. Rather it is a film that will have you constantly chuckling and	 although (and I did have to think back carefully to be sure) there is a fair dose of blood-letting and violence	 the delectable humour	 so well enhanced by the surreal milieu created by Director Currie and his co-screenwriters	 goes a long way towards making this seem like a feature that ought to be rated PG-13. I urge you to go see this little Canuck gem. I'll certainly be buying the DVD once it emerges hopefully by next Summer."	1.0
"I got this film from a private collector and was very curious about it. It had a 7	8 in IMDb (9 votes only) and some external comments were pleasant. But I have to say that it is a very usual and uninteresting giallo. Yes	 great cinematography	 the film is well directed	 but it never freaked me out. It starts well	 but although it not bored me at all	 the story is so ordinary and the things that occur so normal	 that I didn't like it very much.<br /><br />You can make a few laughs. And you can see some little tits. But if you like the kind of giallos I like (bizarre	 surreal	 nonsenseful	 gory	 atmospheric	 brutal murders...) you won't appreciate much this film.<br /><br />I give it a 4 for the good directing and editing	 and the final twists	 that make the film entertaining.

From the opening scenes in the horn factory	 to the car motor running from the back seat of the car	 to Ollie answering the phone and being accidentally pushed out the window by Stan	 I think this was perhaps their best latter day film.

Jimmy Finnlayson	 their long time foil	 in his last appearance with the boys	 showing up as the Doctor is super! quote: "" I said goat milk "" his reply to Stan asking him how do you milk a ghost!

"I was really stunned how much a film	 that's over 60 years old could impress me. It is nearly two hours long	 there are absolutely no stars in it	 there are subtitles but nevertheless it is interesting and exciting to watch. What impressed me mostly was the realism of the film. You could nearly feel the coldness of the ice	 because you could see that the storms are real. This is a relief in a CGI-world like ourdays. I wondered how much work this must have been for van Dyke. I read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it. Now who wants to talk about 'Titanic' anymore? It's a great film with a great message and I would recommend it to future directors to see how great and realistic movies can be if they are only directed with realism instead of visual effects."	1.0
"Dolph Lundgren stars as a former cop/boxer who searches Boston's kinky scene to find out who killed his brother	who was well thought of in the community	 however along the way he learns how his brother enjoyed kinky sex and that a serial killer is to blame. Dolph Lundgren is very good in this movie	 in fact on the basis of his performance here	 one would forget Lundgren's rise to fame involved action roles. That said the material gives Lundgren nothing to work with	 in fact	 Lundgren is completely left out to dry in a dreary thriller which is both predictable and incomprehensible. Co-Star Danielle Brett is also good	 in fact the film works best when it centers around the chemistry of Lundgren and Brett	 indeed had the film taken the time to explore their relationship the film would've been fairly decent. However the movie is lackluster	 the action is non-existent	 the plot not given enough exploration (Too much boring B.S around Lundgren's investigation of his brother's employer) and the film is needlessly gory and ridiculous. Once again	 Lundgren is actually really good (As is newcomer Danielle Brett) but the film just lumbers from one sequence to the next	 which makes this movie particularly disappointing. If anything else though	 it shows how underrated Lundgren is	 as an actor.<br /><br />*1/2 Out Of 4-(Poor)"	0.0

Charlton Heston as the guilt-ridden Sam Burgade in his felling somehow responsible for killing Provo's wife and then having to face the fact that the same thing can very well happen to his daughter Susan is perfect in the role of the aging and retired sheriff. Charles Coburn as the vengeful half breed Zach Provo is also at his best as the obsessed with hatred and murder escaped convict.<br /><br />The man who escaped with Provo are really not interest in his personal affairs but have no choice	 in that he knows the territory like the back of his hand	 but to go along with him. It's only the thought of them having their way with Susan	 when Provo gives them the green light	 as well as the buried $30	000.00 in gold coins that keeps them from breaking up and going their own way.<br /><br />Also going along with Burgade is Susan's boyfriend Hal Brickman	 Chris Mitchum	 who proves in the end that he's as good as Burgade is	 who felt that he just didn't have it in him	 in both tracking down the escaped criminals as well as using common sense	 which in this case Burgade lacks	 in doing it.<br /><br />***SPOILERS**** The unbelievably brutal and blood splattered showdown between Burgade and Provo is almost too much to sit through. Provo who's hatred of Burgade bordered on out right insanity wanted him to suffer a slow and excruciating death. it was that hatred that Bugrade took advantage of and	 after taking some half dozen bullets	 thus ended up putting the crazed and blood thirsty	 as well as mindless	 lunatic away for good!"	1.0
"Did you ever wonder how far one movie could go? <br /><br />Schizophreniac relentlessly explores the world of the extreme with Harry Russo. <br /><br />Harry is an aggravated writer	 killer and drug addict scumbag who will stop at nothing to destroy those who stand between him and insanity. Driven by the demonic voices of his ventriloquist dummy rubberneck	 Harry begins his killing spree. <br /><br />From director Ron Atkins comes the 1st installment of the vilest story ever to be filmed<br /><br />The only other movie I have seen similar to this would happen to be the 2nd installment entitled Schizophreniac Necromaniac<br /><br />This is a really low budget film and will not be for everyone	 but if you are looking for something disturbing	 different and horrific then this would make a fine choice.<br /><br />DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING LIKE MODERN DAY HORROR (Such as Scream)<br /><br />Viewer discretion is advised"	1.0
"I can watch a good gory film now and then. I've seen some pretty sick stuff. However	 this is one of the few films that I found to be grotesque in a way that was just plain repulsive and revolting. I like gore films when they are fun. I like wen they are a lot of creativity behind them. The gore in this film is not creative. It is sick. It is repugnant. It is completely unpleasant. Because of this	 this film is certainly not entertaining. The film is a horror film	 but it lacks scares. So pretty much the only reason why one would watch this film is for the gore	 but that is the most unappealing and ugly aspect of the whole film	 and that's saying a lot. The acting is terrible	 the plot makes no sense	 and the music is really annoying and WAY too electronic sounding. It all took me right out of the film. Pretty much the whole film is one big long depressing ordeal. There's this guy that has a freak accident in a shuttle and awakens in a hospital to find that his skin is dissolving and melting off. I guess that after that he goes out and eats human flesh in order to slow down the melting process. There's some weird subplot involving an old couple getting chased by a dog	 some dismembered head floating down a stream	 and an ending involving a man being electrocuted. There were times where I tried really hard to enjoy it	 but the only scene in the whole film that I thought was even entertaining was the scene early on in which a nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion. If you like ugly	 nasty	 ad unappealing horror films	 this one is for you."	0.0
"Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He is a true actor. He captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary. Mary is such a beautiful woman. It's her love that makes Rob Roy the legend	 but it's his passion that makes her love undying. They need each other. Tim Roth as the evil Cunningham is perfect; in one way or another	 upon watching the movie	 you will find Cunningham disgusting. The Scotland scenery is beautiful. The environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well. If you like history	 romance	 passion and love	 you'll enjoy Rob Roy. There is violence and blood	 but it's unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told; no gratuitous violence. And you do have to listen carefully if you're not used to a Scottish accent. One important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes. It's their skill as actors that attracts you	 they don't rely on marquee names	 popularity or sex symbol appeal. This is something special."	1.0
"I was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work	 honestly. Some people were looking for a plot??? OK	 when this video came out over a decade ago	 I watched it for what it was: a collection of music videos. It's not a movie. It doesn't have a plot	 nor a central storyline. It's a rather artistic anthology of mostly long-form videos	 all of them rather smartly or creatively done. Michael Jackson may be considered a freak these days	 but	 after all	 this was the man who gave us Thriller (considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time) and set trends with Billie Jean and Beat It. With Moonwalker	 he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to create some vividly entertaining stuff	 incorporating claymation	 special effects	 live performance footage	 and even self-parody (the ""Badder"" sequence). And for those wondering what Joe Pesci was doing there	 this video came out just a tad before he became a household name	 and was one of his most memorable appearances on film. And	 IMHO	 I think the Smooth Criminal sequence (the choreographed section) beats anything else Michael Jackson did up to that point!"	1.0
"This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen	 (yes it's even worse than Dungeons and Dragons and any film starring Kevin Costner.)<br /><br />Chris Rock looked very uncomfortable throughout this whole film	 and his supporting actors didn't even look like they were trying to act. Chris Rock is a wonderful stand-up comedian	 but he just can't transfer his talent to this film	 which probably only has two strained laughs in the whole picture.<br /><br />If you haven't watched this film yet	 avoid it like the plague. Go do something constructive and more interesting like watching the weather channel or watching paint dry on a brick wall.<br /><br />For Chris' efforts I give it a 2/10!<br /><br />"	0.0
"Watching ""The Fox and the Child"" was an intoxicating experience. The lush visuals	 integrity of point of view	 and utter beauty of the setting and characters left me in a swoon of pleasure.<br /><br />The plot is uncomplicated. Deceptively simple. Within the container of that simplicity a world unfolds that draws you in and leaves you breathless.<br /><br />I laughed. I wept. I learned.<br /><br />This is a movie you can trust yourself to -- give yourself over to. Dare I say it is an act of love intended for any innocent heart. It reaches to the heart of the viewer--of any age--and reveals the world through new eyes	 as if seen from the heart.<br /><br />Adi Da Samraj once said that true Art draws the viewer beyond point of view into ecstatic participation in Reality. I feel I have been privileged to watch--no	 to participate in--this film	 a work of true Art."	1.0
"The second alternate Gundam universe tale (G-Gundam being the first)	 Gundam Wing is yet another different view into the Gundam verse. The familiar elements are found but Gundam Wing is actually different then its counterparts. The biggest being the Gundams are nothing more than terrorists combating one lone organization. In truth	 the series doesn't really become a show about war until episode 7 but in truth the real conflict	 the Eve Wars	 don't happen until the later episodes. <br /><br />The greatest positives of this series are it's characters. All the main characters are fleshed out throughout the 49 episode run and you can really sympathize with each of the roles their put in. Another great plus is the fantastic character and mecha design of the series. The designs put some of it's other Gundam counterparts to shame. <br /><br />One of the biggest criticism of this series is how many die hard UC fans claim rip off of the original UC saga. Why Gundam Wing gets this rap when the more apparent UC clone of Gundam Seed is out there is beyond me. True there are many moments lifted but their told in new ways and there are distinct differences as well.<br /><br />Take for example	 the usual comparison of Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. Throughout the series	 Zechs is more the outcast in the Alliance and in ways OZ as well	 while the Red Comet was shining symbol of Zeon. Another big difference is the fact Zechs loses a lot soldiers under his command hence the other nickname he's given in the early episodes: ""Killer of his own men."" Char isn't given this label. <br /><br />The problems with this series isn't the philosophy mumbo jumbo but two problems. The first is the reused animation footage of the Gundams attacks. Sure it's fun seeing Heavy Arms attack tanks	 MS	 and planes the first time. But on it's fourth re-use scenes like this do get old. <br /><br />The second problem is that the entire series is supposed to take place during an entire year. If you really think about all the events springing in the series	 a lot happens in just one lone year. <br /><br />But I guess you can easily dismiss this fact when ignoring the intro's first lines every so often. As it ranks	 this is probably the best of the Alternate universe Gundam tales and a great introduction into the Gundam world. After all	 this was the very first Gundam anime to air in the US television."	1.0
"I rented ""New Best Friend"" hoping for a movie similar to enjoyable teen thrillers such as ""Gossip"" and ""The Curve"". Instead	 ""New Best Friend"" is much more like ""The In Crowd""	 in which there are no thrills and the acting is incredibly phony. ""New Best Friend"" is boring	 and the events during the movie are the same. Skip this movie...it's a waste of time."	0.0
"After a promising first 25 minutes that makes you feel all warm inside	 you're pretty convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy. Then the movie takes a turn for the worse. <br /><br />The warm feeling might still be there	 but as others has said: The plot becomes so unbelievable and artificial that it's almost unbearable to watch. <br /><br />The movie gets sped up	 and you get the impression that you're either fast forwarding through it	 or that the producers decided to fit it in less than 1h40m and had to cut a lot of scenes out.<br /><br />Realism isn't a goal onto itself	 but as a viewer	 I'm pretty convinced that this comedy isn't intentionally unrealistic	 it just happens to be.<br /><br />On the plus side	 this movie has a couple of nice interiors	 and despite the bad script	 I think that the actors performances are mainly good. If I could rate the first 25 minutes only	 I'd probably give it an eight. As it is now	 it gets a four. ...And that's being nice! <br /><br />If you're a sucker for romantic comedies you'll probably have a great time anyways. If not	 I'd recommend that you watch something else."	0.0
"This movie is most possibly the worst movie I have ever see in my entire life! The plot is ridiculous and the whole ""Little Man"" crap is just so stupid. The entire movie is unrealistic and dumb. Let's face it	 It's just a ""Black Comedy"". This is just a pointless horrible piece that should have never made it to theaters. The jokes are not funny and the acting is horrendous. Please	 I beg of to you save your money than see this worthless piece of crap. I had to endure sitting through Little Man for an hour and a half wishing my eyes would bleed. I am disgusted that something like this would even be thought of! Who writes this crap? The actors have NO talent what so ever	 how do these people get into Hollywood? They are making money off this junk!"	0.0
"This isn't as violent as I was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effective.<br /><br />There are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know who's side a particular character is on.<br /><br />The plot is pacey with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the workings of the Triad gang it follows.<br /><br />The violence when it comes is brutal	 no guns or martial art scenes with special effects	 this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the Triad is a violent criminal organisation.<br /><br />The ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable."	1.0
"The movie was a suspenseful	 and somewhat dark	 look at the severe results of a genuinely human mistake. Connery and Fishburne work very well together in this thriller about murder and redemption. Keep your boots on for the strange turnaround at the end of the movie...you'd never expect it!"	1.0
"A man brings his new wife to his home where his former wife died of an ""accident"". His new wife has just been released from an institution and is also VERY rich! All of the sudden she starts hearing noises and seeing skulls all over the place. Is she going crazy again or is the first wife coming back from the dead? <br /><br />You've probably guessed the ending so I won't spell it out. I saw this many times on Saturday afternoon TV as a kid. Back then	 I liked it but I WAS young. Seeing it now I realize how bad it is. It's horribly acted	 badly written	 very dull (even at an hour) and has a huge cast of FIVE people (one being the director)! Still it does have some good things about it. <br /><br />The music is kinda creepy and the setting itself with the huge empty house and pond nearby is nicely atmospheric. There also are a few scary moments (I jumped a little when she saw the first skull) and a somewhat effective ending. All in all it's definitely NOT a good movie...but not a total disaster either. It does have a small cult following. I give it a 2.<br /><br />Also try to avoid the Elite DVD Drive-in edition of it (it's paired with ""Attack of the Giant Leeches""). It's in TERRIBLE shape with jumps and scratches all over. It didn't even look this bad on TV!"	0.0
"I hope the viewer who regards 'Dream Machine' as one of Corey Haim's finest and the ""best movies of the century"" was kidding. Undetected sarcasm on my part? I sincerely hope so.<br /><br />'The Dream Machine' marks the first of a long line of mediocre capers that would plague the rest of Corey Haim's career (except 'Prayer of the Rollerboys' which was surprisingly decent). Here	 Haim plays nonchalant college boy	 Bernie	 who supposes that a cool car will attract his dream girl's attention. Lucky for Bernie	 a rich woman aiming to get back at her cheating husband	 hastily decides to reward her faithful piano tuner--Bernie--with a gift: a slick Porsche Turbo. However	 unbeknownst to the woman	 and unfortunate for Bernie	 is that her dead husband was murdered and his body was hidden in the trunk. Now	 being that in this movie	 bodies don't seem to decay or possess a rather foul funk	 Bernie is unaware of this. In fact	 the oblivious boy has no idea that something suspicious is afoot despite several odd circumstances that arise. In particular	 a grizzly man follows him around	 desperate to get hold of that body relatively undetected.<br /><br />This is a low-grade action fizzle as many of Haim's films like this are (see The Double O Kid). Despite being part action	 part romantic comedy	 this movie fails to offer the viewer much of anything of interest for at least the first forty-five minutes in which the filmmakers take more than enough time to show the immediate problem (i.e. Bernie being in possession of a car and a dead body	 and a hit-man finding out that the Porsche is going to be hard to find). After which	 and thanks to poor acting by Haim (I loved this kid	 too	 but it's not exactly sacrilegious to admit the times when he obviously couldn't act well) and the lack of real immediacy and emergency between Bernie and the villain that makes much of the events unconvincing and as a result	 inappreciable. To add injury to insult	 the soundtrack was unbelievably laughable and sounded more like self-evident songs you would hear in Team America (see the 'date' montage).<br /><br />Loyal Corey Haim fans	 however	 should not be disappointed to see their boy in abundance. However	 others understanding that Haim's career probably peaked when he was 14 or 15 and never recovered	 might expect mediocrity	 as will viewers just looking for early 90s b-comedy fluff to pass the time."	0.0
"I just saw this film @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Fans of Hal Hartley will not be disappointed!! And if you are not familiar with this director's oeuvre ... doesn't matter. This film can definitely stand all on its own. I have to go the second screening ... it was amazing I need to see it again -- and fast!! <br /><br />This film is very funny. It's dialogue is very smart	 and the performance of Parker Posey is outstanding as she stars in the title role of Fay Grim. Fay Grim is the latest feature revisiting the world and characters introduced in the film Henry Fool (2000). Visually	 the most salient stylistic feature employs the habitual use of the canted (or dutch) angle	 which can be often seen in past Hartley works appearing in various shorts	 available in the Possible Films: short works by Hal Hartley 1994-2004 collection	 and in The Girl from Monday (2005).<br /><br />I viewed this film most aptly on Sept 11th. Textually	 Fay Grim's adventure in this story is backdropped against the changed world after September 11	 2001. Without going into major spoilers	 I view this work	 and story-world as a bravely political and original portrait of geo-politics that is rarely	 if ever	 foregrounded in mainstream fictional cinema post-911 heretofore (cf. Syrianna: of side note - Mark Cuban Exec. Prod in both these films ... most interesting	 to say the least). <br /><br />Lastly	 for those closely attached to the characters of Henry Fool	 Simone	 Fay and Henry this film is hilariously self-conscious and self-referential. That being said	 the character of Fay Grimm starts off in the film	 exactly where she was when Henry Fool ended	 but by the end of the film ... Fay's knowledge and experience has total changed and expanded over the course of the narrative. What can be in store for the future of Fay and the Fool family ... ?? I can't wait for the third part in this story!"	1.0
"THE SOPRANOS (1999-2007)<br /><br />Number 1 - Television Show of all Time <br /><br />Everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldn't go past a pilot episode. The Sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time. <br /><br />James Gandolfini plays the enigmatic New Jersey crime boss	 Tony Soprano	 accompanied by a stellar cast. Edie Falco is superb as the worrying	 loving upper-middle class mother; Tony Sirico is tremendous as a superstitious	 greying consiglieri who is often very funny. <br /><br />While the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of Italian-Americans as mafiosi	 and to an extent this is undeniable	 I can see so many positives from the show. The portrayal of strong family values	 friendships	 love and compassion; could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters? Yes. Furthermore	 other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism	 social inequality and injustice	 homosexuality	 drugs etc. This is no shallow	 dull show about tough guys and violence. It has so much more. Many of the issues we see on the show are very real. <br /><br />The writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters' lives	 which makes the whole thing more interesting.<br /><br />Credit must go to David Chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to James Gandolfini	 for envisioning	 television's most complex and enigmatic character. <br /><br />Simply exceptional.<br /><br />10/10"	1.0

"I loved the episode but seems to me there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting punished for effectively being an accomplice after the fact. While I like when a episode of Columbo has an unpredictable twist like this one	 its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode	 along with the uncovering of the murderer.<br /><br />The interplay between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is priceless. At one point	 Gordon	 playing a famous writer	 makes some comment about being flattered by the famous Lt. Columbo	 making a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the detective's real life fame as a crime-solver. This is one of the best of many great Columbo installments."	1.0
"A spoiler.<br /><br />What three words can guarantee you a terrible film? Cheap Canadian Production. THE BRAIN fits those words perfectly. Terrible script	 idiotic acting and hilarious special effects make this a must for every BAD movie fan. The horror is hilarious. The post production team looks like it gave up. What makes THE BRAIN admirable is in the second half	 it actually tries to be good! Can a bit of ingenuity and consistency save what is already a joke?<br /><br />It's around Christmas time. A mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever. The day later	 a rebel teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis.<br /><br />If a cop 's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it	 who would you believe? What begins as funny turns dull and tiring toward the end when THE BRAIN tries to be serious. A child cannot be frightened by the scary moments. THE BRAIN is too funny a concept to try and be gritty. The Psychological Research Institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! Our ugly villain and its cohorts get credit for pulling some of the worst acting I have seen. Viewer discretion advised heavily."	0.0
"Paulie sounds like the most saccharine	 lachrymose and sentimental garbage you could ever find	 yet it's actually much better than you might expect. The daftness of the plot could so easily have set the tone for the whole film	 but actually in most other departments the film is charming.<br /><br />In case you're wondering	 Paulie is a parrot. Bought for a little girl with speech difficulties	 Paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her. He even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons	 and eventually becomes a super-intelligent speaker himself. However	 Paulie is sent away by the little girl's mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from N.Y.C to L.A to be re-united with her.<br /><br />So	 why does this awful-sounding film succeed relatively well? Firstly	 it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects. Secondly (and far more significantly) it has the courage to embrace its ludicrous premise and tells a genuinely moving	 often humourous story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the storyline. Thirdly	 it has several surprisingly strong performances	 including Jay Mohr as a wily crook	 Gena Rowlands as a kind old lady	 and Cheech Marin (yes	 the dope-smoking Cheech Marin!) as a musical immigrant. It might not be a classic	 but Paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages."	1.0
"This film is an attempt to present Jared Diamonds theory of ""Guns	 Germs and Steel""	 explaining how Europeans have dominated much of the globe.<br /><br />The version I saw of this documentary came on 2 discs covering 3 hours. I think the information could have been presented in 20 minutes. There are completely useless scenes of: Professor Jared Diamond watching birds through binoculars	 Professor Jared Diamond failing to use a bow and arrow properly	 Professor Jared Diamond firing a muzzle-loader badly. Was this documentary supposed to make a hero out of ""Professor Jared diamond?"". This part of the documentary was so bad	 it could have been a spoof. The worst was when Diamond is shown breaking down and weeping when touring the malaria ward in an African hospital. None of this helps me understand his theory of ""Guns	 Germs and Steel."" BTW	 ""Guns	 Germs and Steel"" is said about 100 times. ""Can the Europeans guns	 germs and steel get them out of this dire situation? Stay tuned and find out!"" When he finally gets down to business	 his theory is equal parts interesting and utterly boring. Europeans conquered the natives peoples of other lands	 because they had guns and fine blades against stone and wooden weapons. Do I really need a professor to convince me of this? The parts of his theory that explain how the Europeans came to have the advantages that allow the conquest are interesting	 but the coverage is paper-thin.<br /><br />In the end	 I think the documentary was only trying to convince me that non-Europeans are as capable as Europeans. If I'm not a racist	 I already know this. If I'm a racist	 Jared Diamond is not going to convince me with his bumbling use of native implements.<br /><br />I don't think adults are the intended audience for this documentary. Kids may enjoy this more than I	 though. I have read that the book from which this documentary is much better than the documentary."	0.0
"Here is the example of a film that was not well received when it was made	 but whose standing seems to be raising in time. 'The Tenant' is quite an interesting work by Polanski	 one of the first of his European exile. It is set in Paris	 and as in so many other exile films the city	 its streets	 the Seine and especially the building where the action takes place play an important role. It is just that Polanski chooses his principal character not to be an American (as in 'Frantic' for example) but a Pole	 as himself was when going West. There is actually a lot of personal commentary in this film	 made at what must have been a time of crisis in the director's life	 and the fact that he decided to play the lead role (and does it masterfully) may also be seen as some kind of exorcism.<br /><br />It's in a way a circular story. The hero named Trelkovsky rents an apartment in old Parisian building	 inhabited by what seem to be first a well assorted team of grumpy old or just ridiculous neighbors. The previous tenant tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the window of the flat	 and Trelkovsky has just the time to visit her in the hospital before she dies and meet there her young and beautiful friend Stella (a spectacled Isabelle Adjani in her first role after Truffaut's 'L'histoire d'Adele H.'). Soon the neighbors do not seem to be what they are	 it's a conspiracy to make him crazy	 or to make him enter the life and role of the dead girl. He fights	 tries to run	 enters the game and ends by entering the circle and slowly becoming her. The circle is closed.<br /><br />It's not the most believable story we may have seen or heard	 but the strength of the film does not reside in the story but in the details of the psychology	 in the slow degradation of the mental state of the hero	 in the permanent balancing game between reality and delusion. To a certain extent it is not what happens on the screen that matters	 but how it happens	 reminding the classical 'Knife in the Water' made more than a decade before	 at the end of the Polish period of Polanski. There are many details that are never explained	 but then this is how mystery films must be and this is actually how life is sometimes. The feeling of claustrophobia slowly contaminates the viewer. Unfortunately some of the graphical details in the last part of the film are not too well executed and the English spoken dialogs (the film was made in English) almost neutralize the overall atmosphere. However	 waiting for the final punch scene is very worth the patience.<br /><br />It's not the best film that Polanski made	 yet has many good parts	 it shows the hand and the style of the director	 and was a significant step in the building of his career."	1.0
"The documentary presents an original theory about ""Guns	 Germs and Steel"". The series graphically portray several episodes strongly supporting the theory	 and defend the theory against common criticism.<br /><br />I was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about lack of new information in these series. They say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school. Indeed	 it does. In fact	 I greatly enjoyed the original look at the information which I have known since middle school and the unexpected analysis.<br /><br />So	 if you like knowing WHY things work	 if you have taken apart the telephone trying to determine how it worked	 if you have gone to the farm to see how farm works and how cows are milked	 you will enjoy this series. A definite recommendation."	1.0
"This is an incredible comeback from movie director mastermind	 Tsui Hark. It is one of a few movies that deserves to come a face to face match to Steven Chow's Shaolin Soccer. From the moment the movie started	there was astronishing backdrops at every edge which were<br /><br />deplicted with superb style. If you are a science fiction or chinese martial arts ""geek""	 you'll love the excessive amounts of many 3D effects and realistic computer generated weapons. There	 comes a fine performance(as always) from Ekin Cheung who plays ""Sky King"". He teams up with Louis Koo(Red) who i was very impressed by his flexible ""wing"" which deflected incoming attacks. The fighting movements of these actors were proficient in every way. Not only is the action superb but the has a somewhat complex storyline. Many Criticisers of this movie complain of the lack of story/theme or just ""shoved in random bits of debrise"" and even describe as ""The Legend of Poo"". However	 the viewer cannot rely on watching Dragon Ballz and other similar Manga Cartoons to understand this movie. Others who are famarialy with ""Wu Xia"" movies will have a better appoach. In due respect. there can be one weakness that could be foreseen. The blow that was deliveried to the enemy at the very last fight scene could of been more substantially and devastiingly made.In spite of all this	 its a must see."	1.0
"If Hollywood is to be believed	 being in the the Navy is nothing but a bludge. Though the sailors may complain in chorus about the monotony of the ocean	 it seems that their oceanic duties are completely non-existent	 and somehow Fred Astaire finds enough free time during the day to offer dancing classes to a fleet of would-be romantics. Such is the world of Astaire and Rogers. Mark Sandrich's previous film	 'Top Hat (1935)	' completely ignored the Great Depression that was then bringing America to its knees	 and presented audiences with a glittering world of the rich and famous; it was the film's optimistic outlook on life that perhaps contributed to its success. Likewise	 here Sandrich deliberately forgets that the life of a Naval officer is difficult and draining	 and instead substitutes the duties of a sailor with an assortment of catchy lightweight musical numbers.<br /><br />""Bake"" Baker (Astaire) and Sherry Martin (Rogers) are two former dance partners whose romantic relationship fell apart after the latter rejected a marriage proposal. After Bake returns from several years of duty in the Navy	 he finds Sherry as dance hostess in an unsophisticated San Francisco ballroom. While the two former lovers alternately attempt to woo and rebuff each other	 Sherry's plain	 music-teacher sister (Harriet Hilliard	 looking really quite pretty) receives a complete makeover and tries to charm superficial sailor Bilge ""Bilgey"" Smith (Randolph Scott). There are plenty of the usual screwball comedy shenanigans	 a few moments of mistaken identity	 and even a hilarious trained monkey that steals every scene it's in. Particularly amusing is the scene in which Bake sabotages a performer's audition in order to create a window for his estranged girl; unluckily for both of them	 it is an unfortunate Sherry who drinks the bicarbonate of soda and loses her ability to sing.<br /><br />'Follow the Fleet (1936)' was the fifth winning collaboration between Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers	 and the third (of five) in which Sandrich directed the pair. Irving Berlin provided the film's music and lyrics	 and each musical number is enjoyably lighthearted and entertaining	 even if they aren't quite as memorable as those in 'Top Hat (1935)	' 'Swing Time (1936)' or 'Shall We Dance (1937).' Astaire attempts to break free from his typical rich-man-about-town persona	 without much success	 but it's hard to imagine the performer without the boyish carefree charm that could only accompany being considerably wealthy. The side-plot of the romance between Connie and Bilge works well with the antics of the two main stars	 and Harriet Hilliard (wearing a brunette wig to avoid clashing with Ginger's blonde hair) has a couple of emotional solo numbers	 including ""Get Thee Behind Me Satan	"" which was originally written for 'Top Hat.'"	1.0
"This film should have never been made. Honestly	 I must admit that before I saw it I had some serious doubts. The director is not a great actress	 though she did a lot of movies in Holland	 and the young woman who took the main part is a TV-personality with a constant smile on the face and not much self-criticism. The actor who played the other main part I recently saw in Bride Flight and although that film is better	 he did not convince me than. To start with the the story	 I have not read the novel it is based upon	 but the script that underlays the film is something that might have been done with in mind kids having a birthday party on a rainy Sunday afternoon	 not someone of the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie. Something really disturbing were the overdubbed dialogues	 it was most of the time spoken out loud. My regards go to the cameraman	 at least he tried to make something out of it. It is a pity that the film is edited lousy	 if not	 some scenes were certainly more credible."	0.0
"It seems that it is becoming fashionable to rip ""Basic Instinct 2	"" to the point that a significant part of the audience (including critics) found it terrible even before it was released. It seems even more fashionable to trash Sharon Stone wholike all of usis now fourteen years older	 andunlike most of usstill looks wonderful. First comments on this movie were so vicious that I had to see for myself. In my opinion	 this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film	 but is not as bad as most comments pretend. Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven	 neither Henry Bean and Leora Barish are Joe Eszterhas. ""Basic Instinct 2"" is just an entertaining	 average thriller	 and besides the addition of Jerry Goldsmith original score	 keeps little resemblance to its predecessor. Even Stone gives her character a different dimension	 creating a lustful	 devilish Catherine Trimell	 who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. She is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her leisure. Unfortunately	 she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick. She became too successful	 too much of a main icon	 and like all those actors who have reached that level	 her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by Hollywood audiences.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is outstanding	 giving performances that are far better than the material deserves. David Morrissey is a much better actor and by far more interesting than Michael Douglas: his acting is flawless	 giving a dense	 complex dimension to an otherwise one dimensional character. Since he has more screen time and is the axis of the movie	 he can keep your attention from beginning to end.<br /><br />I am not recommending ""Basic Instinct 2"" as a great movie; I am just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that agendas other than the movie itself are shaping the opinion of most spectators."	1.0
I thought the children in the show did a very good job. I especially enjoyed the performance of the Emma character. Well done! The stunts were pretty good for a low budget show. I was able to follow the movie and enjoy it without having to look at my watch every 5 minutes.I enjoyed the scenes with the tooth fairy and the burning of her. The ghostly apparitions of the children's souls being released was also good. Another good point of the movie is that it kept moving along. There wasn't a lot of slow scenes. The adult leads were also believable and therefore helped to keep the show entertaining. All in all an enjoyable night of movie watching.	1.0
"It ran 8 seasons	 but it's first	 in early 1959	 and it's last	 in the autumn of 1965	 were shorter than seasons 2-7. CBS chief William Paley canceled Rawhide's production after watching the 1st show of season 8	 in September	 1965	 because he disliked the series without Eric Fleming as Gil Favor	 who had departed after season 7. The last new episode aired in November	 1965. The lone 1966 CBS broadcast	 on January 4	 1966	 was a rerun. <br /><br />I have often wondered why Rawhide didn't switch to color filming for it's last season? Most of the big westerns of the 1960s had gone over to color by 1965. CBS was broadcasting in color that autumn	 for many of their sitcoms	 but westerns like Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained in black and white. Gunsmoke was the last western (and last prime time network series to switch to color) on September 17	 1966	 for the episode Snap Decision."	1.0
"This movie does have some great noirish/neorealist visuals	 and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of Hollywood's sugar-coating	 which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some of the scenes go on for much too long (the wedding	 especially)	 and I found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialog to be more fit for the stage than for the silver screen.<br /><br />The dialog was particularly distracting	 and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on. Most of the characters were either Italian-Americans or Italian immigrants living in New York in the twenties and thirties	 but their dialog sounded like they were practicing lines for a Shakespeare play while they mixed cement and laid bricks. Toward the end I was laughing	 and not because the filmmakers wanted me to. I guess the stilted poetry could be defended by saying that the characters would have been speaking Italian	 and the dialog is a literal translation of how they would really talk. But it absolutely did not work for me.<br /><br />Another line of dialog made me laugh for a different reason: the main character's son	 born and raised in New York in the 1920's	 suddenly picks up a lovely lilting British accent. I'm only guessing this had something to do with the fact that the movie was made in England.<br /><br />I give this movie an 'A' for effort and intention	 but a considerably lower grade for execution."	0.0
"Another Priyadarshan/Vohra flick another movie that was seen for TP rather than actual desire	 the only reason i did see this movie was the fact that the regulars were not there in this movie (Akshay Paresh and many others)	 but needless to say i had low expectations from this movie.<br /><br />I was happy with the casting in general except	 Rajpal Yadav who once again annoys to no limit	 he does however extract some laughs	 but these were those standard slapstick non-original jokes	 in fact this whole movie is like playing the dhol	 I mean it takes hardly any talent to make loud noise	 or even play the odd good beat on the dhol for a small time does it?? Its only those who can carry different beats in a nice sequential manner	 for an extended period who are considered great.<br /><br />Which brings us to the other instrument	 the Dumroo hardly requires any talent	 it has no variations	 and it may be enjoyable for a while the monkey dances (hmm sounds like Rajpal Yadav	 good analogy)	 but its not a instrument that will entertain you for long or even get you dancing like the Dhol does.<br /><br />This movie was like the dhol and the dumroo being played	 sometimes the Dhol was played sometimes the dumroo	 sometimes both together	 but mostly the Dumroo played alone and the monkey danced. And like any 24 year old sooner than later I got bored.<br /><br />The movie has some good Dhol (good) moments but after a while all i heard was the annoying Dumroo (entertaining initially	 then tolerable then irritating)	 the large ordinary parts really ensure this movie is mainly good for a few funny clips on ""MERE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA"" (if you haven't watched it watch it on Filmy	 it comes in the evenings and is really quite funny).<br /><br />This movie had its moments	 the actors did a fine job	 except Rajpal Yadav (who can act though	 I've seen him in Main Meri Patni ) who annoys more than entertains	 I've said it many time and I'll say it again I really think Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a fine career ahead of them in the multi-star comedies especially.<br /><br />Some scenes were really funny such as the aborted attempts to impress the girls father	 the zany attempts to woo the girl and take her away from each other.<br /><br />But after this was over there was a failed attempt to make this movie into much more with a mystery added	 this mean that once the girl was in	 the following 45-60 mins was increasingly torturous	 the climax was ""SO BAD ITS ALMOST GOOD CATEGORY""	 I mean what were they thinking if you had to have tense ending at least make some attempt to make it palatable.<br /><br />The movie is also extremely predictable	 there's hardly a scene you cant predict and you wont be breaking into spontaneous burst of laughter here	 its more like you see it coming and almost start laughing before the gag.<br /><br />The movie follows a gradual decline throughout the movies except for the odd bump	 down or up	 and then rapidly tumbles downhill once they have made friends with the girl.<br /><br />Most of the really bad scenes were towards the end	 one the movie tries to be more than a run of the mill comedy	 also many of the jokes were very very stale and reeked of repetition	 THE LAST 10-15 WAS ESPECIALLY DISTATEFULL AND COMPLETELY SPOILS THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />I didn't find Tanushree Datta quite the siren she was to play	 and her acting talent is in serious question	 especially in view of her non-appealing looks	 if you cant be a HOT and cant act how much time can you survive.<br /><br />Technically also this movie was weak	 with the constant female gaze and shoddy lighting and camera-work.<br /><br />The songs except the title track were no good either	 when the songs played in the 2nd half I could feel the collective gasp from the audience.<br /><br />In all a movie that's just ordinary merely because of the cast	 and the very low expectations.<br /><br />Avoiding it wont be a bad idea.<br /><br />And if it has to be watched watching it on TV for free or a very cheap matinée or something is a must	 if you pay full multiplex rates you will feel disappointed.<br /><br />-s lots of stale jokes	 RAJPAL YADAV	 LAST 45 MINS AND LAST 15 MINS ESPECIALLY	 bad technically	 bad songs.<br /><br />+/-s tries to be more than what it was	 not the regular cast (I'm happier for it)	 Tanushree Datta.<br /><br />+s some good scenes towards the beginning	title song	 good acting and cast except RY.<br /><br />total 4.5/10 (I'm trying to be objective here	 i don't like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie did meet my very low expectations	 so I'm giving it the benefit of all doubts	 on absolute terms this movie was not more than a 4)"	0.0

What a shame	 and shame on th network for not giving this show a full seasons chance. This was an excellent show to watch with a great cast.

ba ba ba boring...... this is next to battlefield earth in science fiction slumberness. genie francis (aka general hospital's laura) has a small role as a reporter and that in itself should tell you that this movie must be bad.... there is ben kingsley (an academy award winning actor) in this stinker and a few others decent actors. You have to wonder what possessed them to decide to do this awful movie. The music dramatically goes up and down like it's a major dramatic story. Even if you pay attention the plot is impossible to follow. The effects are mediocre as well and seem really dated. All of the actors speak in a monotone voice and have no realism to their dialogue. I could go on and on on how this is a bad movie. At least with Battlefield Earth it's so bad it's funny but this is just b o r i n g. Avoid unless you want to be lulled to sleep.	0.0
"Two old buddies are sent to Japan to get back results of a genetic research containing videotape	 which is stolen by the black suited ninjas at the beginning of the movie. First they just have to learn some ninja skill	 because ""only ninja can beat the ninja.""<br /><br />Sakura killers tries hard to be enjoyable ninja-flick but fails that badly. The whole movie is just so hollow and predictable that is hard to say anything good about it: Same plot has been seen in different variations dozens of times before	 characters are too briefly drawn	 direction is dull and script doesn't offer anything surprising	 even in the ending scene	 which by itself reduced movie's (trash)value.<br /><br />Even 80's ninja-flick-fan	 who understands the esthetic of trash-movies	 is hard to find this movie even barely enjoyable. It simply doesn't offer anything new to viewer	 neither in visual level nor in plot. Shurikens are thrown and katanas are swinging	 but it's not enough to lead the movie direction it meant to be and recurred similar fighting scenes numbs even the most calloused viewer after the first 30 minutes.<br /><br />It's hard to recommend movie to anyone. Even Franco Nero's clumsy performance in ""Enter the Ninja"" falls behind Sakura killer's American-ninjas. Even in visual level movie doesn't have any balls and it's waste of time to try to find any great fighting scenes in this movie: There isn't any. In all	 one of the most futile ninja-flicks	 I've ever seen. Doesn't interest even in curiosity. Trust me on this one.<br /><br />½ out of 10."	0.0
"""The Good Earth"" is a great movie that you don't hear much about anymore. There are a lot of big disasters and events	 but it is also a non-passionate love story. All of this happens in a little over two hours	 which is short by today's standards. The special effects and costumes are very good for the time period.<br /><br />I am surprised that Luise Rainer received an Oscar for such a limiting role.

"Holly addresses the issue of child sexploitation that is rampant all over the world (some 2 million children are trafficked every year) and does so sensitively and without manipulation--a tall order that the team at Priority Films does with great success. American actor Ron Livington stars in the film alongside newcomer Thuy Nguyen	 a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly	 and together they bring to screen what is commonplace to the people at the notorious k11 redlight district in Cambodia. Although it tackles a heavy topic	 the film holds on to moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters up close	 keeping the two-hour film from being one that is too difficult to watch. I am glad a film like this is bringing the world's attention to the problem. Child prostitution needs to be stopped and this is a very good first step. It's GREAT and a film EVERYONE must see."	1.0
"Well	 I just ordered this on my pay-per-view at home because I was bored and needed a laugh. I have to admit	 I did chuckle a few times	 but I don't even remember what parts they were at. I don't understand why this movie was made. It claims to be a comedy but seriousuly	 I don't find a singing penis	 or a naked 70 year old woman very funny. This movie was trying to fit itself into the 'gross-out' comedies of recent years such as American Pie and Road Trip	 but it just failed miserably. It was way to much gross-out then it was comedy. Also	 why on earth did Cameron Diaz attach her name to this movie?!?! The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I thought it was sexy and enjoyable and well-done. Besides that	 avoid this movie. 3/10"	0.0
"Mesmerizing	 breathtaking and horrifying	 this hauntingly beautiful film is the ""Apocalypse Now"" without fiction. Slow in pace	 quiet in mood	 it gives good glimpses of the poisoned patches of Earth that may well be signs of an inevitable doom.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind -- the nature is plagued and we are the disease. Greed	 the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress	 has turned us into something like cancer	 on its way to consume the host and die with it...<br /><br />Manufactured Landscapes is quite an unforgettable viewing experience - at least I'll never regard my toaster and iron the same way again."	1.0
"Although the casting for this film was admirable	 particularly Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott	 the quality of the writing was so poor that it would be impossible for any actor or director to make this film worth watching.<br /><br />My wife and I decided that the reason we watched the entire film was that it was like a train wreck	 and it was almost impossible to turn away. It may have been that we ""hoped"" that the message would eventually make itself apparent	 and that we would be able to glean some meaning from this effort. Unfortunately	 this did not happen.<br /><br />Of course the audience may have been able to ""make sense"" of this convoluted tale	 a credit to the ingenuity of the human brain to make sense of the absurd. The writers	 however	 did NOTHING to facilitate this innate need we seem to have for finding meaning.<br /><br />It was apparent that those involved were simply going through the motions of their respective crafts	 and that any intrinsic passion for the characters or the story was either secondary or non-existent.<br /><br />Unfortunately	 made-for-TV movies have seemed to devolve over the years. Whereas communicating a message to the audience may to have been the primary interest of the writers in the past	 present-day writers and producers seem condescending to their audience	 concentrating primarily on manipulating us to ""stay-tuned"" through the incessant advertising which seems to be the only reason movies such as Surrender	 Dorothy are made."	0.0
"After viewing this film	 I felt the compelling need to vent a bit of my frustration. Selma Blair is a fabulous	 currently underrated actress and Max Beesley was rather charming in ""Kill Me Later"". The story	 while not exactly original	 certainly showed some promise. None of that mattered though...at all.<br /><br />I don't know what her deal is	 but director Dana Lustig has virtually no talent whatsoever as a director. She slowed footage down	 sped footage up	 reversed footage	 used awkward camera angles	 used annoying color filters	 made a zillion quick cuts	 jumped back and forth in the timeline and topped it all off with an obnoxious ""modern"" soundtrack of blaring junk. I can't remember the last time I saw such an incompetent job of directing a film. Her ego must be huge to toss out the acting and story and put her direction front and center for the audience members to take notice of. It is crammed down their throats.<br /><br />There are a couple of good scenes in ""Kill Me Later"" which show what could have and should have been. Unfortunately	 just when things would start to show promise	 Ms. Lustig would dig into her bag of film school tricks and jumble things up again. It's a shame because Blair and Beesley had good chemistry and you could tell that the film really had a good heart. 3/10"	0.0

"Once when I was in college and we had an international fair	 the Russian section had a Soviet-era poster saying ""Ne boltay!""	 meaning ""Don't gossip!"". I ""translated"" it for the ""generation"" of TV watchers as ""Don't be Gladys Kravitz!""

In this case	 the perpetually witless soldier overhears something about bombing and immediately assumes that the Axis Powers have attacked the United States. So	 he tells it to someone	 who tells someone else	 who tells someone else	 and it continues. As in ""The Russians Are Coming	 the Russians Are Coming""	 the story gets blown more and more out of proportion each time	 so that when it gets back to Snafu...well	 you know what I mean! Yes	 it's mostly WWII propaganda - complete with a derogatory term for the Japanese - but I have to say that the Pvt. Snafu shorts were actually quite funny. Of course	 since they had Dr. Seuss writing and Mel Blanc providing the voices	 it's no surprise that these came out rather cool. Worth seeing."	1.0
"Trudy Lintz (Rene Russo) was one very fortunate lady many years ago. She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money. Her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on her property grounds. Trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children. They dressed in clothes and had many amenities. One day	 she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla. Knowing nothing about the large apes	 she relies on her husband's medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorilla's life. Once out of danger	 Trudy decides she will raise the gorilla	 also	 as one of her children. This works well for years and Buddy	 the gorilla	 is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home. But	 Buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous. Will Trudy be able to keep Buddy under control? For those who love animals	 Buddy is a must-see movie. Based on a true story	 Trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore. Of course	 Buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one	 in the film	 but he is very close to seeming totally real. Russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice. The costumes are exemplary	 as befitting the earlier era of the story	 and the settings and production values outstanding. But	 most importantly	 animals are here in abundance	 not only Buddy	 but the adorable chimps	 the ducks	 the rabbits	 and so forth. For those who want to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven	 here on earth	 this is a great movie choice. All animal lovers	 and even those who just want to watch a great family film	 will go ""ape"" over Buddy."	1.0

"Checking the spoiler alert just in case.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most horrendous movies I have ever seen	 Mazes and Monsters felt like I wasted 101 minutes of my life. The only redeeming quality of the movie were scenes that tried to be serious	 but just ended up being funny since they were so bad. Evil Dead anyone?

"I love Seth Green. His appearances on THat 70s' Show is always worth watching but last night	 I felt the show needed to overhauled. Four single young guys inherit a New York City apartment that most of us would die for. The grandmother must have been an heiress to have such space in the first place. So I felt the need for realism should have been brought out. Anyway the plot about four best friends getting this apartment was not believable. I would have been thrilled if they had to move in with one of their parents which would have provided great humor and dysfunctional about the show's set up. There did not seem to be much humor in it. I am only watching it because it falls before My Name is Earl on a winning Thursday night. I think they should go back	 scrap this series	 and start over. We need more family involved series. How about Seth and his friends move in with his wacky parents in the suburbs after a fire burns their place down. THey could have Dabney Coleman play the father and Christine Estabrook	 play the mother and dysfunctional siblings.

"I must admit - the only reason I bought this movie was because I am a big fan of Gackt and a *huge* fan of Hyde. I was expecting a good movie with a lot of shots that were	 shall we say	 pleasing to the feminine eye but a slightly cheesy story. I mean	 the synopsis sounded really out there. And now that I have just finished watching it - I feel the need to tell the world of its brilliance! Hyde and Gackt both gave heart-wrenching performances	 and my eyes are still hot from the crying that lasted throughout the last half of the movie. You get sucked into the story	 and you really feel for the characters by the end. The element of vampirism - which I love	 but is very easy to overdo or to ruin a movie with - is subtly mixed into the storyline as to make it something merely exotic	 normal to this setting	 rather than a random unnecessary addition to the story. I ranked it at a 9 out of 10 at first...and then I went back and tried to think of why I wasn't giving it that last point. Came up with nothing. So a ten out of ten it is.

FearNet is a site that shows scary horror movies.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful from all the actors. I hated the story. The story was stupid. The movie starts out with a man with a scroll with a signia stamped onto it. He breaks the seal and certain disasters happen. The water turns to blood	 the oceans die out	 the moon turns red	 etc. <br /><br />The female character was annoying as well. A lot of the stuff she did didn't make sense. Like when she sees a piece of paper with a date on it. Coincidentally	 it's the date she's expected to give birth to her baby and she starts freaking out about it and starts researching it and asking religious people what it all means.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert* <br /><br />The two worst things happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that God told him to murder his parents and the end where Demi Moore dies after giving birth to her baby and transferring her soul into it.<br /><br />Here's what happens. The mentally retarded person gets shot and killed and the apocalypse begins. Demi Moore gets into a hospital in the middle of a massive earthquake and gives birth to her child. She touches her child's head	 transferring her soul into the child and then dies. Then	 the apocalypse stops.<br /><br />Why does God all of a sudden have a change of heart? He gets furious when the Governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man then he's all about forgiveness once a lone woman transfers her soul into her baby? <br /><br />*End Spoiler* <br /><br />The movie is pretty stupid. It's another religious end of the world propaganda piece. The acting from Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and everybody else is excellent. That's about all there is.<br /><br />I give this movie 2 stars out of 10. Good acting with a lot of nonsense!"	0.0
"1st watched 11/07/2004 - 1 out of 10(Dir-Jon Keeyes): Over-the-top rehash of 70's supposed horror flicks like Friday the 13th(versions 1 thru whatever ). I can't think of much redeeming here except(or can I think of anything?) The story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program one year after some kids were slayed in the woods as an 'homage' to this	 supposedly. But	 lo and behold	 one of the stupid people	 have connections to the actual event because her sister was one of the ones murdered(again	 how stupid is this that she would even be a part of this). Guess what? The murderer is at it again and we're tipped off from the very beginning who it is(so there goes any mystery whatsoever). And besides all this	 where are the 'cops' and why doesn't someone call them. I can't believe this movie was financed by someone and made. You would think that by now the American people would be judged a little higher	 at least in their movie-going experience	 but not so by this filmmaker."	0.0
"Caught part of GEORGE 2 on TV recently	 but couldn't get myself to watch it through to the end. Just awful! I can't even remember the plot. All I know is that George and Ursula were not the George and Ursula of the first movie	 which was bad enough. There's a lot of scrambling around	 but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy	 it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes. Having the original voice of Ape the Ape back was not nearly enough to make me warm up to this. GEORGE 2 is probably the single worst sequel I have ever seen	 and that is saying something. Jeez	 because of IMDb's 10 lines rule	 I have to keep typing when I have nothing more to say about this crapulastic made-for-TV sequel. Disney	 hang your head in shame."	0.0
"I first saw this movie 3 years ago	 and it was introduced by then Disney chief Eisner and the real Jim Morris.<br /><br />About a month ago	 it came back on TV	 and this time I taped it. Since then I must've watched it at least three times.<br /><br />This is a wonderful	 inspirational	 feel good movie that is intelligently written and believably acted by everyone concerned. It resists going for every sentimental trick in the book	 as well as all of the other clichés.<br /><br />It is refreshing to see a movie where the kids aren't jerks and have a whole slew of behavioral issues	 and the jocks aren't portrayed as testosterone driven muscleheads.<br /><br />These are just normal people who have dreams like you and I.<br /><br />In my opinion	 Hollywood as gone the other extreme to what they term ""gritty realism""	 making movies where everyone curses	 and has problems with aggression.<br /><br />This movie is about a man who has a dream	 and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue that dream. The people in Big Lake TX seem so personable that I want to move there.<br /><br />As I said b4	 the film doesn't try to go overboard with sentimentality. Dennis Quaid	 as usual	 never disappoints. I've watched him from the late 70's	 and he is so underrated.<br /><br />But this movie has excellent performances from EVERYONE concerned	 and kudos to the writers.<br /><br />A gem in the movie is near the end when Jim is practicing in the dugout before the big game	 and his wife calls out to him from the stands. He rushes over and reaches out to his family. The look on the faces of the three other pitchers sitting on the bench in the dugout is priceless.<br /><br />If you're looking for a change of pace	 then pick this movie up."	1.0
one of the worst films i have seen to date. Pathetic action scene and really bad acting also do not help. The only good point is Gary busey's parts but this does not lift the film very much. it lives up to its B film ranking and passes the test with flying colours. A waste of my money although i found entertaining to begin with its gets annoying after a few watches. i do not recommend this film unless you watch it for free or its a gift. ( a gift you can ask for the receipt and send back for a complete refund).<br /><br />Really BAd.<br /><br />1/10.	0.0
"I love this film and it is such a wonderful example of a family jeopardy	 a romantic love story	 and a very sad story plot. Everything was just so perfect and excellent about this film. It was such a great mixture of actors and actresses and with some laughs and a lot of cries this film deserves to get plenty of awards. With the mention of beautiful scenario	 and although I would relate this film to The Notebook and The Family Stone	 it was sort of much more cunning	 sad	 and brilliant than those films. The Evening tells of a love story between an old woman dreaming back to her younger years	 and her two daughters stay by her side while she is not well. The story dating back is so strongly told and wonderful I was sitting on the edge of my seat. You really get to know all the characters and by the end	 I was wanting to watch it all over again. This is a amazingly sad and vividly acted and plotted movie that is really one of a kind and should be seen by all for how wonderful it really is. All the performances are astonishing and the film captures your attention from the very beginning and never lets go. I loved it	 and am so glad that I watched it for it was truly an astonishing film..."	1.0
"<br /><br />I have to admit to enjoying bad movies. I love them I watch all of them. Horror especially. My friends and I all gather after a hard week at school and work	 rent some crazy tapes	 order a pizza and have a blast. One of the ones we got at Hollywood Video	 was this one	 Zombie Bloodbath. This one had a great box	 so I was expecting less than usual.<br /><br />The story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above-ground layers bulldozed	 and the other underground layers are simply covered up. The inhabitants of this neighborhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave. This wakes up some zombies.<br /><br />From this point on	 it's chunk-city. The gore effects and action never stop until the end credits roll.<br /><br />OK	 it's not great art	 but this one	 with it's in-joke dialogue and over-the-top gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening. Actually	 it was one of the best ""party tapes"" I have ever had the pleasure of watching. And you could tell it was done on no money	 with a bunch of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies	 and the Director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has a cameo) and it is just a wild trip."	1.0
"This is just a joke of a movie	they lost me already at the opening scene (Spoilerwarning) dangerous creature kills other creature in his cage	this is watched by a scientist that works there on a monitor and guess what she does	well lets go in to the cage to check the stuff out	omg how dumb do those writers think human beings are come on thats the same like jumping in a fish tank with a great white shark because it ate your goldfish...Pretty useless and even more dumber.And i will not even talk about the cast because they aren't worth the effort. why they didn't fired the guy that wrote that immediately is a mystery to me.....And this kinda dumbness continues the entire movie. Only good thing where the cgi that is better then average for these kinda low-budget movies.<br /><br />If these kinda things don't bother you go see it	but be warned if your IQ is above 60 you will probably hate it."	0.0
Indian cinema typifies cops of two broad categories: they are either the honest type or the bad guys. The honest guys always shout at the top of their voice and fight the system while the bad cops enjoy for most part but suffer at the end.<br /><br />This movie at least breaks this usual formula and gives a refreshing view of cops and their lives. The direction takes an inside look at the life of a young ambitious cop who. The music is interesting and the editing is a trend setter as far as Indian cinema goes.<br /><br />The movie is slow at times and the dilemma which Anbu faces when it comes to Maya is overplayed at times. But I would still give this one 9/10 simply because it has many firsts to its credit.	1.0
"Like a lot of series pilots	 Dark Angel's opener shows a mixture of great potential and a slight problem finding its own feet. Not that this is unusual in any way	 but there is a feeling that it could have worked better if the story was tightened and focused a little more. In today's world where something has to catch on instantly or face cancellation	 the series did itself a bit of a disservice by not coming out at least halfway focused	 with all guns blazing.<br /><br />The ninety-minute pilot really feels like two episodes glued together	 and both episodes have a problem with focus. In the first half	 we are introduced to Max and filled in on what drives her. We also get a few interesting routines with Max using her abilities to win bets	 interacting with a PI	 or sorting out co-workers' domestic problems. The problem here is that this is nothing out of the ordinary for any human being with a normal set of genes	 on television or otherwise.<br /><br />It's when we hit the second half that we get a story with a purpose and focus. Throughout the two halves	 Max finds herself the focus of attention from a pirate journalist who feels it is mission in life to save the world by exposing one dirty dealer at a time. In the second half	 the repercussions catch up with him	 and Max reluctantly cleans up the resulting mess. This sets up the premise for the entire rest of the series	 and it works	 but it doesn't quite click if you get my meaning. It's like most of the pieces are there	 but a couple that make a complete image have been left out. Perhaps they get filled in with later episodes	 but that's beside the point. The fact is that the contents of this episode could easily have been told with twenty-eight less minutes.<br /><br />The last of the negatives is that a lot of the support cast are totally unendearing. Original Cindy in particular is an annoyance	 and I doubt that changed during the next twenty episodes. While the acting isn't as bad as daytime soap	 it isn't of such quality that I'd commend it. Jessica Alba is not the worst actor in the world	 but she does come up short in terms of being convincing when the story needs it least.<br /><br />The good news is that the premise and the production values are all top-notch. In fact	 this series was considered quite expensive to produce	 and it is quite unfortunate that it was cancelled in order to be replaced by another show that didn't last a whole season. Especially when there was ample time for both shows - they could have simply cancelled one of the pieces of disingenious garbage they flog under the banner of reality TV. The fact is that we need more shows like Dark Angel	 where imagination rather than overhype	 are used to draw the attention.<br /><br />In all	 I gave the Dark Angel pilot a seven out of ten. It never rises above the level of throwaway television	 and it never got a chance to live up to the potential it shows within its own running time. But the potential is there	 and that's often all that matters where pilots are concerned."	1.0
"HUSBANDS BEWARE is a remake of the Shemp classic BRIDELESS GROOM. The film's new cooking scene at the beginning of the film is great. The stooges are always funny when they cook. However after the first few minutes of cooking footage	 we cut to original footage of BRIDELESS GROOM. One thing I noticed about these 1953 to 1956 remakes are that they do fit with the new story. They do an insert shot if the old story line doesn't match.<br /><br />HUSBANDS BEWARE does have a new ending	 but I won't give it away to those who want to be surprised.<br /><br /> **** out of 4 stars."	1.0
"In spite of its impressive cast and crew pedigree Gingerbread Man crumbles early and often. The plot is unrealistically convoluted	 the actors sport bad accents and director Robert Altman's participation amounts to collecting a pay check. Once again he has assembled an impressive cast (Like Woody Allen	 everyone wants to work with Altman)that this time around to the letter is miscast. But that's only part of the problem.<br /><br />Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder a high powered Georgia lawyer who in the film's heavy handed opening scenes manages to get himself preposterously seduced by a mysterious catering company waitress who convinces him she is in grave danger from an ex-husband and a loony dad. With red flags everywhere the astute lawyer plods on even managing to get his children in harms way. Fights of gun and fist follow along with a requisite car chase and if that's not enough there's a hurricane thrown in for the ridiculous finale.<br /><br />Branagh plays MacGruder with a mealy and unconvincing Southern accent. Running around in a trench coat in all kinds of weather he's blind to the obvious in order to keep the story going. Hipster Bob Downey Jr. is every bit as bad as a P.I. but with a little more emphasis on the bad accent. Robert Duvall as the old man is Boo Radely all growed up en crazier than a bed bug serving some thick slices of ham but at least his twang is plausible. The female leads (Embeth Davidtz	 Darryl Hannah	 Famkhee Jansen)are lean leggy and unemotive. Even the celebrity lawyers doing cameos (Vernon Jordan) are wooden with the few throw away lines they have.<br /><br />In addition to paying little attention to his actors	 Altman's mise en scene dripping with Spanish moss is murky and shapeless	 his action scenes comic book. It lacks his offbeat touches and observations (he does inform the viewer that the Stars and Bars still wave in Georgia)that make a well done Altman so unique. Unfortunately	 Gingerbread Man is Altman at his worst	 even if the pay is the same."	0.0
"This particular episode of Smallville is probably the best episode to air since reunion. This is for many reasons. For example	 it takes the series back to some of it's roots. It welcomes back Lionel from a supposedly long absence	 with the Luthorcorp plaza office in Metropolis. This room hasn't been in smallville for a very long time	 and seeing it again brings back many memories from the smallville's past. Not to mention	 Lionels conversations with Lex are always admirable.<br /><br />Another pleasant return is	 well uv guessed it	 is Bart Allen(aka Impulse)	 AC(aka Aquaman) and Victor Stone(aka Cyborg). Not only does Steven Deknight reunite the former justice leaguers	 he blends them in with the Smallville formula in such a unique way	 that it almost feels like it is a feature length movie.<br /><br />From there you get the basic story	 Green Arrow forms the league	 attempts to blow up 33.1	 Bart gets captured	 Clark saves him	 and the facility is blown to kingdom com. All is good and graceful	 with a good mix of stealth	 action	 pace and suspense. Oh	 and Cyborg has some cool new upgrades true to the justice league character :).<br /><br />The music is probably what makes this episode work so well. If you remember correctly	 the first episode Steven Deknight directed was Agless from Season 4. This was a mediocre episode	 but something felt out of place. maybe it was the music	 or the acting	 or the fact clark sais at the end ""we didn't find you	 you found us""	 kind of made people lose faith in the formula. But thankfully Steve Deknight redeemed himself in this Justice episode.<br /><br />I had a few quivvles about Justice that made it fall short of the full 10. First of all	 the far too cheesy exit of the justice league from the Ridge facility expolsion. I mean it would have been soo much cooler if say Green Arrow and Cyborg took off on Oliver's bike (rememeber from the arrow episode). Clark and Impulse should have obviously ran	 and aquaman should have swam via another route. But that was soo incredibly cheesy	 it nocked off 2 points from the full 10.<br /><br />Secondly	 another cheesy moment	 not as bad as the first	 but when Green Arrow sais ""let's go save the world"". That made me cringe. All in all	 judging by the acting performances	 music	 direction and production values	 the pros do outweigh the cons	 and this is still one of the best episodes in smallville history	 and maybe the 2nd best episode in season 6.<br /><br />7 Out of 10..."	1.0
"It's difficult to not have a liking for Israeli director Eytan Fox and for his movies	 which describe the life in the middle east and the inherent problems gay people can have in these regions. Besides he also gave voice to the young generations	 and to the remarkable part of them	 who really need PEACE and who want to take no further notice of a war that for too much time marked the existences of people	 both in Israel both in Palestine. These reasons	 in my opinion	 are sufficient to consider Fox a noteworthy director	 even when his feeling for the melodrama is a tad out of control. However the fans of his movies (that he realized on team with Gal Uchovsky	 his producer	 co-screenwriter and also life companion) seem to not being vexed by this	 since his new feature	 THE BUBBLE (HA-BUAH)	 is having the same success of the previous YOSSI & JAGGER and WALK ON THE WATER. Announced as a contemporary gay version of ""Romeo & Juliet""	 set in the present day Tel Aviv instead of Verona and with two men (one Israeli and the other Palestinian) at the place of the two Shakespearean young lovers	 the film actually is quite different from that or	 better	 it's also something else. In fact the bubble of the title is the world apart in which the leading man	 Noam	 played by the Fox regular Ohad Knoller (Yossi in YOSSI & JAGGER	 but I must confess I miss Jagger	 the astonishing Yehuda Levi!) and his two co-tenants	 a guy and a girl	 chose to live. Around thirty-years-old	 restless	 witty and firm (despite the protagonist just spent a period as national service in a checkpoint on the frontier with the Palestine) to live a life that won't be only made of war. The two guys are gay and along with the girl they have established a trio in which they brotherly love and support each other. Their lives are destined to change when Noam falls in love with Ashraf (the TV star Yousef 'Joe' Sweid) a young Palestinian who came to live in Tel Aviv. The laws so far in force among the group are neglected	 but not the will to aid one friend. Still it won't be easy for Noam and his friends	 'cause Ashraf is clandestine in Israel and in the meantime his family	 who lives in Palestine and doesn't know he's gay	 is looking forward to settle his wedding with a very beautiful girl	 who is a relative of Ashraf's beloved sister bridegroom-to-be	 who he is also a terrorist and he will have a strong liability in the development of the plot	 with consequences not just for the two men. Because the prejudices against the homosexuality and the peace (interesting dualism	 if not automatic) are stubborn and so the tragedy is unavoidable. Even if the film focus on the obstacles the relationship between Noam and Ashraf meets with	 it doesn't the overlook the other characters	 which turn out well written (for example Golan	 the boyfriend of Yelli	 Noam's fellow tenant	 introduced as a lively boor	 and then disclosed as a sweeter and more open minded person) and aptly performed (besides the two leads	 we mustn't disregard the funny Zohar Liba and the lovely Daniela Virtzer	 the girl of the gang; moreover LATE MARRIAGE's star Lior Ashkenazi appears as himself in a cameo). It also melds the gloomy tones with the more brilliant ones	 even if the director can't do without a melodramatic conclusion. I watched this movie more than a month ago and in the meantime I often thought about it	 proof that Fox and his pal have a knack to strike home."	1.0
"Passport to Pimlico is a real treat for all fans of British cinema. Not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy	 but it is a cinematic flashback to a bygone age	 with attitudes and scenarios sadly now only a memory in British life.<br /><br />Stanley Holloway plays Pimlico resident Arthur Pemberton	 who after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb	 discovers a wealth of medieval treasure belonging to the 14th Century Duke of Burgundy that has been buried deep underneath their little suburban street these last 600 years.<br /><br />Accompanying the treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by King Edward IV of England (which has never been officially rescinded) to state that that particular London street had been declared Burgandian soil	 which means that in the eyes of international law	 Pemberton and the other local residents are no longer British subjects but natives of Burgundy and their tiny street an independent country in it's own right and a law unto itself.<br /><br />This sets the war-battered and impoverished residents up in good stead as they believe themselves to be outside of English law and jurisdiction	 so in an act of drunken defiance they burn their ration books	 destroy and ignore their clothing coupons	 flagrantly disregard British licencing laws etc	 declaring themselves fully independent from Britain.<br /><br />However	 what then happens is ever spiv	 black marketeer and dishonest crook follows suit and crosses the 'border' into Burgundy as a refuge from the law and post-war restrictions to sell their dodgy goods	 and half of London's consumers follow them in order to dodge the ration	 making their quiet happy little haven	 a den of thieves and a rather crowded one at that.<br /><br />Appealing to Whitehall for assistance	 they are told that due to developments this is ""now a matter of foreign policy	 which His Majesty's Government is reluctant to become involved"" which leaves the residents high and dry. They do however declare the area a legal frontier and as such set up a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road	 mainly to monitor smuggling than to ensure any safety for the residents of Pimlico.<br /><br />Eventually the border is closed altogether starting a major siege	 with the Bugundian residents slowly running out of water and food	 but never the less fighting on in true British style. As one Bugundian resident quotes	 ""we're English and we always were English	 and it's just because we are English	 we are fighting so hard to be Bugundians"" <br /><br />A sentiment that is soon echoed throughout the capital as when the rest of London learn of the poor Bugundians plight they all feel compelled to chip in and help them	 by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire blockades.<br /><br />Will Whitehall	 who has fought off so may invaders throughout the centuries finally be brought to it's knees by this new batch of foreigners	 especially as these ones are English!!!! <br /><br />Great tale	 and great fun throughout. Not to be missed."	1.0
"What exactly was going on during World War 11 in New Zealand when American forces were there?<br /><br />This awful story of 4 sisters was really pathetic to view. Can you imagine casting Joan Fontaine as the older sister to Sandra Dee? Fontaine looked more like her mother. Even funnier was that Fontaine becomes pregnant in the film.<br /><br />Piper Laurie and Paul Newman who showed such great on screen chemistry 4 years later in ""The Hustler	"" have no scenes together in this film. Laurie plays another sister who goes off to Wellington to tramp around there	 despite the fact that she is married. Woe to her when her husband comes back from the war.<br /><br />Jean Simmons is widowed and finds romance with a much subdued Paul Newman. There is even romance for the young Miss Dee here.<br /><br />The picture has little to no meaning. Are they trying to say that all is fair in love and war? If they are	 they did a poor job in selling this.<br /><br />The conflict of interest with Newman and Simmons is quickly disposed of. That is what should have been quickly done to this terribly disappointing film of 1957."	0.0

"Arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons. A good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and to help out with the horses during the stable scene just recently passed away. If you look fast you can see Frank Graham during the restaurant scene in the background while Dudley Moore and Jill Eikenberry are in conversation. Frank was a champion equestrian and will be missed by all who knew him.<br /><br />Secondly though	 I actually knew a real life Arthur Bach. He was not quite as wealthy as Arthur	 but spent 47 years of his life basically as a kid. His parents tightly controlled his purse strings	 but his rent and utilities were paid for in a basement apartment in Greenwich Village. He spent a good deal of his time getting himself intoxicated on various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself	 just like Dudley Moore does. <br /><br />The wonder with Arthur is why anyone would bother with him wealth of not. But that's the other half of the equation. My friend was a most charming person when you got to know him. In fact it was almost a compulsion to be charming. He couldn't buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the vendor. He spent his life being a perfect party guest. The term wastrel which was in common use in the 19th century would apply to him.<br /><br />And that's what Dudley Moore is	 a wastrel. Unlike my friend Moore has John Gielgud to clean up after him. That's a full time job as we see demonstrated in Arthur. My friend also never found a Liza Minnelli	 a male Liza Minnelli in fact because he was gay. Still Moore's portrayal of Arthur Bach is deadly accurate and so real for me.<br /><br />Arthur	 20th century wastrel	 is being forced to marry another trust fund baby in Jill Eikenberry. Since he won't work for a living	 the threat of being cut off is quite real for him. He only has his butler Hobson played by John Gielgud and chauffeur Bitterman played by Ted Post to pour his troubles out to. We should all have such troubles.<br /><br />John Gielgud in his nearly century of life certainly did better work than in Arthur on film and in fact Gielgud is more prominently known for his stage performances. Yet 1981 was a year of sentiment at Oscar time. The Academy gave Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn Oscars for On Golden Pond and Gielgud the Best Supporting Actor Award essentially for the work of a lifetime. That man was amazing	 still at his craft almost to the end.<br /><br />So to Frank Graham who worked in the film and to Jackie Weiss	 a genuine real life Arthur	 I dedicate this review."	1.0
"I completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie. For instance	 the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it then how could ""Hollywood"" just throw in a token gay character in the movie. And besides there was two gay characters and I thought they reflected each other great. One was normal and the other was more feminine but it wasn't over the top. And Diane Keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the decency to actual watch the entire film they would have seen that her character developed through out the film by interacting with the other characters. For instance when she and Adam went to look at the car that Sara crashed in the junkyard you could see the maternal side of her come out and later in the film you saw that she too was invincible. But I guess if you're too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad. But if you're more open-minded and I don't know actually have some inkling of what is good then you'll enjoy this film."	1.0
"If this had been done earlier in the Zatoichi series it could have been one of the best. It is good enough	 as most of them are	 but the plot and the characters seem too complicated for the series at this point. The situation is unusually intriguing: the farmers in the province have two champions	 a benevolent boss (for once) and a philosopher-samurai who starts a sort of Grange; both run afoul of the usual local gangsters	 who want the crops to fail because it increases their gambling revenues and their chances to snap up some land; their chief or powerful ally is a seeming puritan who is death on drinking and gambling but secretly indulges his own perverse appetites. (He also resembles Dracula	 as the villains in the later Zatoichi movies tend increasingly to do.) These characters have enough meaning so that they deserved to be set against Zatoichi as he was drawn originally	 but by now he has lost many of his nuances	 and the changes in some of the characters	 such as the good boss and the angry sister of a man Zatoichi has killed	 need more time then the movie has to give	 so that the story seems choppy	 as if some scenes were missing. Other than that	 the movie shows the virtues of most of the others in the series: good acting	 sometimes lyrical photography	 the creation of a vivid	 believable	 and uniquely recognizable landscape (the absence of which is obvious in the occasional episode where the director just misses it)	 and a technical quality that of its nature disguises itself: the imaginatively varied use of limited sets so their limitations seem not to exist. And of course there is the keynote actor	 whose presence	 as much as his performance	 makes it all work. This must be one of the best-sustained series in movie history."	1.0

Lerner is suitably over the top in this	 but Zelda repeats lines of dialog over and over again. That gets annoying fast. But not as annoying as the two girls who are watching the movie within a movie.As a horror film this one fails	 it's too busy trying to be clever	 trying to impart a message and seems to forget a slasher film must evoke a sense of tension	 or at least a jump or two.

Unfortunately that's a VERY small portion of the movie.<br /><br />The story is screamingly obvious and have been done many times before--and much better too. The subplots are	 to put in nicely	 badly handled. The love triangle between The Kid	 Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I actually became insulted. His wife beating father is needed for the story	 but the scenes are so badly handled (in acting and direction) that I couldn't believe it. The script is terrible--lousy dialogue and some truly painful ""comedy"" routines. And there's tons of misogyny here--The Kid's mother getting beaten; The Kid hitting Appolonia and (for no reason) Appolonia strips and goes topless to swim in a dirty river. Also Williams' and Princes' characters treat women in a horrible manner constantly.<br /><br />The acting is where this movie REALLY fails. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful--but no actor. And Prince is (easily) the WORST actor I've ever seen. His blank face and wooden dialogue delivery are so bad I couldn't believe it. This movie only comes to life during the concert scenes but there aren't really that many. The ""dramatic"" scenes are so badly acted and handled that they make this movie a chore to sit through. They should have just made this a concert film. I give this a 2--only for the music."	0.0
"Cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it's not the run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi flick. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what's going on. The close-up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive. The sci-fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie. The technology used in the movie isn't overly impressive	 however	 the director makes good use of the props. <br /><br />The character development is intentionally shallow. The main character	 Jeremy Northam	 decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage. It's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it's the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end."	1.0
"I'm not entirely sure Rob Schmidt qualifies as a ""Master"" in the genre of horror	 since he previously just directed one horror film called ""Wrong Turn"" and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre	 but fact is that he made with ""Right to Die"" one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the ""Masters of Horror"" franchise. There was a similar underdog story in season one	 when William Malone made on of the best episodes with ""The Fair Haired Child"" even though his other long feature films ""Fear Dot Com"" and ""House on Haunted Hill"" sucked pretty badly.<br /><br />The story of ""Right to Die"" cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia	 but thankfully also features multiple old-fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance	 murderous conspiracies	 pitch black humor and comic book styled violence. Whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband's continuous adultery	 the Addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident. Cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife Abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially. Whilst Cliff and his sleazy attorney (Corbin Bernsen of ""The Dentist"") want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor	 Abbey's mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on Cliff. Meanwhile Abbey's hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in Cliff's surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices. After a few victims	 Cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well. ""Right to Die"" is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff I always hoped to see from a TV-series concept like ""Masters of Horror"". It's violent and gory with a sick & twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences. The euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well	 yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons. The atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling. Actresses Julia Anderson and Robin Sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks	 which is always a welcome plus	 and Corbin Bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean-spirited and egocentric bastard. Great ""MoH"" episode; definitely one of the highlights of both seasons."	1.0
"Thankfully as a student I have been able to watch ""Diagnosis Murder"" for a number of years now. It is basically about a doctor who solves murders with the help of his LAPD son	 a young doctor and a pathologist. DM provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment. What made it different from the many other cop shows and worth watching many times over was its cast and quality of writing. The main cast gave good performances and Dick Van Dyke's entertainer roots shone through with the use of magic	 dance and humor. The best aspects of DM was the fast pace	 witty scripts and of course the toe tapping score. Sadly it has been unfairly compared to ""Murder	 She Wrote"". DM is far superior boasting more difficult mysteries to solve and more variety. Now it is gone TV is a worse place. Gone are the days of feelgood	 family friendly cop shows. Now there is just depressing 'gritty' ones."	1.0
"This is one powerful film. The first time I saw it	 the Scottish accents made it tough for me to understand a lot and that ruined the viewing experience. I gave up on it but then acquired the DVD	 used the English subtitles when I needed them	 and really got into this movie	 discovering just how good it is. It is excellent.<br /><br />The widescreen picture makes it spectacular in parts	 with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded me of Braveheart	 an involving tale of good versus evil. Here	 it's Liam Neeson (good) vs. Tim Roth (evil). Both do their jobs well.<br /><br />Few actors come across as despicable as Roth. Man	 you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant	 irritating puss. (He is so nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone else's here). Neeson is a man's man and a solid hero figure as Gibson was in Braveheart. Jessica Lange is strong in here as the female lead. The movie draws you in and gets you totally involved	 so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this."	1.0
"This ""film"" attempts to follow the genre of low budget	 hand-held camera flicks that have proved to be very effective and successful.<br /><br />This one	 fails	 and HOW.<br /><br />It's amazing how many so called ""awards"" this piece of garbage has got plastered on the cover..... it makes you wonder what these critics were on when they actually submitted this....<br /><br />Words fail to describe just how absolutely appalling this movie really is. Seriously	 it's THAT BAD.<br /><br />I watched it in 20 minutes flat	 on almost continual fast forward.<br /><br />From rubbish lighting to dreadful directing	 grainy visuals to muffled sound	 and of course not forgetting the ABYSMAL acting	 this was one completely and utterly pathetic piece of so-called film making.<br /><br />It seriously	 has NO redeeming qualities - whatsoever. Save your cash and watch a decent low budget horror flick	 there are plenty out there - Dead End	 The Blair Witch	 REC	 to name but a few.<br /><br />AVOID this rubbish at all costs. DO NOT waste your money or time on this piece of trash pretending to be an actual film.<br /><br />Take heed of all the other comments! You've been warned!"	0.0
"Admittedly	 I didn't have high expectations of ""Corky Romano."" But then again	 who did? However	 I felt it deserved the benefit of the doubt. I had no high hopes of ""Joe Dirt"" either--another recent comedy starring an SNL cast member--and I ended up being pleasantly surprised. But this film is just as bad as it looks in the previews. Chris Kattan is actually a talented comic actor--contrary to what you might think after watching this movie--with great energy. He's been in many hilarious SNL skits	 and I think he's one of the most talented cast members on SNL as of now. In this case	 he's given a lame	 pointless script and he tries to remedy each scene with his incessant mugging. Throughout each scene	 he attempts a lame Jerry Lewis act and fails miserably. Jerry Lewis knew how to pull off this type of physical comedy	 not to mention he worked with much better writing. Kattan simply looks like some ignorant fool with ADHD who had one too many Cafe Lattes. He doesn't even wait for the punchline; he assumes we'll all laugh once he starts jumping around like an ape on crack. In one scene	 he ends up in a tugging match with a dog who has a package of cocaine in his mouth. The package explodes and the cocaine splashes all over him. He comes back to the job	 strung out on coke. Now	 how are we supposed to laugh at the fact that he's acting hyper and on-edge	 when he's doing the same thing throughout the whole film? <br /><br />As for the rest of the cast members...Vanessa Shaw is really hot	 Peter Berg is wasted in a thankless role and so is Chris Penn. Peter Falk is also wasted	 though he has a few funny lines that I'm pretty sure he improvised. I hope Falk gets a decent movie someday soon. That's too much talent too waste on a clunker like ""Corky Romano."" I didn't like Falk's last movie ""Made"" all that much either	 but at least he had a decent role. <br /><br />I chuckled a few times	 but I could not get a single laugh. Each gag is performed with no sense of timing or delivery. And it's made worse by Kattan's hammy acting. And there are certain gags that are streneously dragged out. For example	 when Kattan is about to fart in his two brothers' faces. He stands there for 2 or 3 minutes	 trying to get out a fart and when he finally he does it's a little tiny one. It's bad enough when you have a gag that's funny and drag it out	 but when you have a lame gag and you drag it out it's a hell of a lot worse. And another example of this is when he tries to translate what those two Asian men are saying during a drug bust. I can go on and on about what's wrong with this so-called comedy	 but I'm not gonna waste my time. Like I said earlier	 if you predicted bad things from the trailers--you predicted right. <br /><br />My score: 3 (out of 10)"	0.0
"Being from a small town in Illinois myself	 I can instantly relate to this movie. Considering the era it was made in	 the townsfolk look uncomfortably like a lot of people I grew up with. Yes the plot is so-so. And yes	 the Acting is not going to get nominated for an Oscar anytime soon. But that isn't the point. The point is to suspend reality and just have FUN. And this movie has Fun aplenty. From the greedy	uncaring banker to the well meaning	but dimwitted deputy	 this movie was made to poke fun at the SciFi genre and small town living at it's best. Who can't smile at the sight of the Enforcer Drone or the Vern Droid? and I LOVED the FarmZoid. Wish I had one when I was growing up. Overall	 considering the technology they had available at the time	 this is a pleasant romp into one's childhood	 when you could sit back on a Saturday afternoon	 Popcorn in hand	 and laugh at the foibles of small town living. This is a movie I would watch again and again	 if for no other reason than to poke fun at myself and my small town ways."	1.0
"Stilted	 stagy	 strange and opaque	 if visually striking ... a wannabe-erotic fantasy. Really boring	 way too much male nudity (including father-son incest)	 and just a sort of shameless pointlessness. I will confess	 however	 that certain passages of dialogue	 taken on their own terms	 do have a lulling	 haunting quality."	0.0
"Well	 when before I saw this film I really wasn't sure whether it would be my cup of tea...how wrong I was! I thought that this was one of the best films I've watched for a very long time	 a real family classic. The story of a young evacuee and his new 'foster' dad	 this film ticks all the boxes. I've not read the book (maybe that's a good thing & meant I enjoyed the film more) but with regards to the story	 I really can't think of any bad points	 hence scoring it 10 out of 10 (and I hardly ever think anything warrants top marks!). By the time William proclaimed 'I CAN RIDE MY BIKE	 DAD!' I was sobbing my heart out (anyone who's seen it will understand	 I'm sure). Really heartwarming	 and definitely recommended."	1.0
"Ah	 the infamous ""Guinea Pig"" series...I honestly have to say that I've been disappointed as a whole by this entire series (""He Never Dies""	""Mermaid in a Manhole""	 and ""Flower of Flesh and Blood"" being the exceptions...and even those aren't great by any means...)	 but ""Devil's Experiment"" just plain blows. There is nothing realistic-looking going on here	 other than the climactic (or perhaps anti-climactic	 depending on how you view it) eyeball piercing scene. The victim appears to not really care what is going on and barely whines or whimpers while being subjected to ""hideous"" (more often sometimes ""hilarious"") tortures. ""Flower of Flesh and Blood"" is a more violent and gory depiction of fake ""snuff"" material	 but that film also falls flat on the realism level. I applaud the Japanese for pushing the boundaries	 and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in ""extreme"" film-making	 but ""Devil's Experiment"" just doesn't hold up. Worth a look if you are a die-hard	 if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about	 but I can only give this film an extremely generous 3/10 and that's only for the needle-through-the-eye scene..."	0.0
"CARRY ON MATRON was released in 1972 and it's becoming clear that the series has reached a natural end with the best entries like CLEO 	 UP THE KYBER and SCREAMING being from the mid to late 60s <br /><br />In itself MATRON is by no means bad it's just that we've seen it all before with a thin plot ( A bunch of spivs trying to break into a hospital to steal a supply of contraceptive pills which they plan to sell to third world countries ) surrounded by gags of a slightly amusing though unsophisticated nature . I think that's where the problem lies - The gags aren't all that amusing with the unsophisticated nature starting to show its age . Did we need another movie that uses a man dressed up as a woman in order to drive the plot ? Perhaps the worst criticism I can make is that I saw CARRY ON MATRON this afternoon 	 less that twelve hours ago and I have a problem in trying to remember a very funny line . That's a serious problem for a comedy"	0.0
"I've given 'Kôhî jikô' a low score not because it was a bad movie	 but because it doesn't do anything worth praising.<br /><br />I've not seen any of Hsiao-hsien Hou's work before	 but for the uninitiated (me included) 'Kôhî jikô' is advertised as a homage to Yasujiro Ozu. (A Japanese director whose last film was way	 way in 1962) The film is an extremely sparse work...containing very little dialogue	 story	 music or emotion.<br /><br />Yo Hitoto plays 'Yoko' a jobless	 wandering character who spends her time in her local coffee shop or loosely investigating a Taiwanese composer she likes. Tadanobu Asano plays her friend	 who works in a cd shop and occasionally indulges his otaku interest in trains. And that's about all it.<br /><br />We watch as Yoko drinks coffee alone...walks around...waits for a train...catches a train...falls asleep on the train. The kind of mundane reality anybody in Japan can see on a daily basis. Hou captures these ordinary moments of these characters life	 but without any meaning to these vignettes it's an entirely pointless film to make or watch."	0.0
"Of all the versions of the Odyssey (or of any Greek mythological story for that matter)	 this in my opinion is the best of them all. Almost true to the original storyline - with some minor deviations and omissions	 e.g. the absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that Eumaeus the swineherd recognizes Odysseus in disguise in his hut - realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiece	not some Hollywoodish sword-and-sandal B-flick. Notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in Italian	 if one is familiar with the storyline	 he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying (provided you have a good handy text of the Odyssey at hand). At least I did	 and so much so that it has inspired me to study the Italian language to better appreciate the movie even more."	1.0
"An incredible little English film for so many reasons. First it's a rare look a Laurence Olivier in a light comedy. While his performance is not up the standard he would latter set as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century	 he is perfectly believable as the hoodwinked barrister. Historically this film is of great interest because of both where and when it was shoot. Being English it didn't have the big budget of the Hollywood films of the same era and it often shows	 but more interesting is the fact this movie filmed just prior to the war and shows an England that would soon be gone. When we watch it today we think in terms of modern morality and over look the fact that this movie and its closest American counter part `It Happened One Night' were in their day as risqué as `Fatal Instinct' was in our time. But after watching and enjoying this movie the first time I can't help but feel sadness when I watch it today. With half of film shoot before 1950 gone	 saving the remaining films means hard choices	 and unfortunately films like this are often passed over to save movies that we all consider important. The color shifting	 lack of contrast	 and generally poor quality of the print most often seen is heartbreaking. This movie along with `It Happened One Night' are perfect to curl up with a love one under a blanket on cool a cool evening and watch	 or better yet why not a double feature."	1.0
"I was raised in a ""very Christian"" household since birth. I was saved before I saw this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to watch it in a youth group at my church. This movie was highly disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and literally had nightmares about it for years. I used to lay awake in bed and listen for the sounds of my mom's footsteps upstairs. If I didn't hear her footsteps	 I would sneak upstairs to make sure she hadn't been raptured. I used to pray so hard every night for salvation because I was terrified of Jesus forgetting me. This is definitely not something I will show to my kids until they are much older	 if at all. It took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me."	0.0
"Having borrowed this movie from the local library a couple of weeks ago intending to originally see this on or a few days after Memorial Day	 I finally got to seeing Sayonara just this morning. In this one Marlon Brando plays Major Lloyd ""Ace"" Gruver	 a General's son who's been raised a certain way	 being transfered from Korea to Japan where his girlfriend Eileen Webster (Patricia Owens) conveniently happens to be. Before leaving	 he tries to persuade one of his men	 a Joe Kelly (Red Buttons)	 out of marrying Japanese woman Katsumi (Miyoshi Umeki) since that's a violation of military fraternization laws. With the romance of him and Eileen on the outs	 however	 Ace not only becomes the best man at Joe and Katsumi's wedding	 he falls for an Asian himself after he and Captain Mike Bailey (James Garner) go out on the town and watch headlining entertainer Hana-ogi (Miiko Taka) on stage. Bailey himself is dating one of the dancers	 Fumiko-San (Reiko Kuba). Eileen herself seems to have a fancy for one of the Kabuki performers	 Nakamura (Ricardo Montalban). I'll stop right there and say that this was a mostly compelling drama about the prejudices concerning American-Asian relations of romance that was very touching from beginning to end. Even seeing Hispanic Montalban playing an Oriental isn't too embarrassing (though it's a good thing his part is short). And there's some nice touches of humor like that of Brando's head hitting the top of Button's and Umeki's inside doorway more than once. Red and Miyoshi themselves deserve their Oscars especially Red with his defiant and proud emotions throughout. Rookie Garner	 before being cast in his legendary role on TV's ""Marverick""	 is fine in his scenes with Brando and Miiko Taka shows great restraint in her initial characterization as an anti-American. While I've read there were some changes from James Michener's novel	 I can't imagine director Josha Logan	 who had previously adopted another Michener work into the Broadway musical ""South Pacific"" and would eventually make that into a movie as well	 not staying true to the original source. He certainly provided some inspiration with the ending scenes that made the heartbreaking earlier tragedy in the film a somewhat necessary plot twist. Some of the production numbers may have made the movie a little longish but otherwise	 Sayonara was wonderful educational experience about the '50s mores that permeated America and Japan at the time."	1.0
"This is an anti-Serb propaganda film made for TV.<br /><br />""The Muslims are good; the Orthodox Christian Serbs are BAD."" <br /><br />That's the message.<br /><br />Using ""entertainment"" to get across a propaganda message is nothing new.<br /><br />This movie lays it on thick.<br /><br />And apparently many viewers and reviewer lap it up.<br /><br />I know better.<br /><br />The Serbs	 under General Draza Milhalovitch and his Chetniks	 saved over 500 shot-down US fliers from the Germans in World War II.<br /><br />Churchill decided to betray Milhalovitch and put British backing behind communist Tito. Roosevelt followed suit and as a result	 after the war ended Yugoslavia was delivered over to communist Tito.<br /><br />And US ally Milhalovitch has been smeared by the media ever since.<br /><br />This movie is part of the anti-Serb propaganda campaign engineered by George Soros and his International Crisis Group (ICG) which culminated in the Kosovo ""War	"" in which Serbia was bombed by NATO because of totally false claims by the ICG of ""mass graves"" in Kosovo filled with ""victims"" of the nasty Serbs. The fact that there were no such mass graves and the Albanians (Muslims) had no business being in Serbia's Kosovo are facts that most of the media won't print.<br /><br />I chose this movie to watch because the one-sentence description on the video cover looked interesting.<br /><br />Imagine my disgust when I discovered I had been fooled into renting another branch of the propaganda machine aimed at Serbia.<br /><br />Instead of this propaganda someone should make a movie about the unwillingness of the Clinton Administration to come clean with the Congress and with the American people about its complicity in the delivery of weapons from Iran to the Muslim government in Sarajevo.<br /><br />I won't hold my breath waiting for such a movie."	0.0
"""Opening Night"" released in 1977	 tries to be an ambitious production. It succeeds only in the truly stunning performance of Gena Rowlands. Her character of theatre actress Myrtle is not necessarily someone we would love in real life. She is self-absorbed	 often obnoxious	 and makes life miserable for those around her - in other words	 not unlike some actresses! Myrtle is also a woman on the edge of collapse - we are not quite sure if the demons she is fighting are real or imagined	 although we are let in on the secret early. Rowlands is obviously well directed with love by her gifted husband	 actor/director John Cassavettes	 who has a role in the film as well. This film is not without flaws - it is overly long	 and the last part of the film where Myrtle goes on stage while very drunk seems almost cruel. The ""improvising"" in some of the dialogue - at least while on stage - goes on way too long. Some of the supporting characters give good performances	 especially from Ben Gazarra	 playing Myrtle's sleazy producer. Joan Blondell's character is never fully developed	 and I never could figure out why she was in the film	 except to placate Myrtle. See this film for Rowlands alone - she is fascinating throughout - and it is tough to take your eyes off her	 although you will want to at times."	1.0
"This is	 quite literally	 the worst movie I have ever watched in my life. It may be the worst movie possible. Some movies are so bad that they're good; this movie is so bad that it goes past enjoyable camp and simply becomes unwatchably awful. It is the anti-enantiodromia. We bought it with the intent to heckle	 and all of my family gathered around for a fun evening of clever remarks; instead	 we sat in stunned silence	 pitying poor Peter Sellers.<br /><br />This is worse than the animated Lord of the Rings.

It is worse than any Batman movie.<br /><br />Do not	 under any circumstances	 let this movie approach within ten feet of your television."	0.0
"OK	 so Mr. Agrama's company (which is involved in some dubious business with former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi) produced a horrendous mish-mash by a Mr. Carl Macek.<br /><br />What is this horrendous mish-mash I'm talking about? Well	 Macek took three entirely unrelated Japanese sci-fi animated series (namely	 Macross	 Southern Cross and Mospeada)	 added TONS of dialogue - believing firmly that the American audience is too dumb to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence - 	 edited the whole lot heavily for violent content	 added some metaphysical mumbo jumbo	 dubbed it using some of the worst voice actors this side of acting Hell (Reba West's singing was - and still is - unbearable and a total outrage	 especially compared to Mrs. Mari Iijima)... And the result was an 85-episode series with hundreds of continuity problems and plot holes.<br /><br />Of course	 the mecha were cool to look at (especially those in the ""Macross Saga"") and the plot parts that remained unscathed were good. But whatever was good about Robotech was not the result of Macek's work or the ""voice talents"" he recruited. It was because of the toils and efforts of the (uncredited - why? would I be too bold to accuse HG of plagiarism here?) Japanese creators. Those of us who eventually got wind of the real deal and compared the originals to Robotech now wish we had never been exposed to Robotech. The originals are so much better	 naturally	 and make a lot more sense.<br /><br />Robotech	 however	 DID something worthwhile: it prompted legendary anime creator Leiji Matsumoto to start a campaign for the protection of Japanese anime creators' intellectual property from such unauthorized and uncalled-for reworkings that talentless people like Carl Macek produce."	0.0

"Emma is a horribly flawed film based on Jane Austens classic novel. I have not read the book so I really didn't know that much about the plot	 and yet I still predicted nearly the entire plot. There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing. The film is though for some reason very entertaining and I loved it. Of course there were all the scenes I disliked but the majority was well acted and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in Emma. The film also stars Toni Collette(Who has okay but has been much better) Ewan Mecgreger(Who has also been better but he is still very good here) Alan Cumming(Who I have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here) and Jeremy Northam(Who's performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle	 even if that was not what it needed) There have been much better adaptations of Jane Austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching."	1.0
"I've long wanted to see this film	 being a fan of both Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic sub-plot was a waste of time	 but the talent of McCallum shines through this juvie role. Thank heavens for Turner Classic which aired the show last week. I can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war	 especially with the way things were throughout the 1950s. Some of the boys are a bit scary. I certainly wouldn't want to met them on a well-lit street	 much less a dark one. There were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well	 or as they call him	 a firefly."	1.0
"A film without conscience. Drifter agrees to kill a man for a mobster for money. Then they double cross him. Meanwhile he falls in love with the dead man's wife	 and	 without her knowing he's the killer	 moves in with her. Then he ""accidentally"" kills her when she finds out. Then	 in a WALKING TALL kind of heroism	 he gets revenge on the mobsters who double crossed him. The first problem is that	 by agreeing to take on the murder by hire assignment	 the drifter loses all sense of sympathy	 worthiness	 and heroism. We can't accept any goodness in him and as a result the rest of the has no moral center. We just can't care about that kind of guy. And the wife (nicely played by the fetching Kari Wuhrer - the sheriff in EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS)	 a high class lady who runs a mission for homeless people	 similarly loses a degree of sympathy by jumping right into bed with the homeless drifter (despite her evidently weakened state after the death of her husband). And	 when she finds out he's the guy  what does she do? She locks him inside her house (as if ALL houses had locks you can't open from INSIDE) with her and proceeds to berate him. Stoo-pid. George Wendt	 however	 is terrific in a role as a beefy thug. Director Stuart Gordon did so much better with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON."	0.0
"The Man from Snowy River II doesn't reinvent the wheel but is a crowd-pleasing beautiful film that hits some great notes.<br /><br />For those fans wanting the elements that made the original Man From Snowy River film a hit	 (breathtaking scenery	 sweeping score	 sweet romanticism and cracking action) this film really delivers. This story picks up a few years from the end of the first	 Jim (Tom Burlinson) has been away gathering his fortune in a brood of stock horses. He returns to pick up where he left off with his pluckish well-bred sweetheart Jessica (played by Aussie divine lady Sigrid Thornton) who is still attempting to break out of her corseted upbringing on her feather's cattle station (Harrison is now played by American Brian Dennehy). The foil to Jim and character that shakes the plot is the well-to-do upper class snob Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie) who has his sights on Jessica. Add to the mix some social tension surrounding landholdings and the stallion with a bad attitude from the first film and that's the plot.<br /><br />The best thing about this film is the acting. Tom Burlinson fits snugly into Jim's wide brim hat and laconic humour. Sigrid Thornton is a lovely heroine and the two manage some real chemistry on screen. Filling the solid shoes of Kirk Douglas was never going to be easy and Brian Dennehy stomps and shouts but never feels very authentic in this part.<br /><br />The music is sweeping and lush and the cinematography could be a roll from a Victoria tourism reel. There are moment however that feel very self-indulgent	 like the director wants just one more helicopter shot of the riders to show how gorgeous the landscape is without some personal human drama. A little more grit would have sufficed here	 we are Aussie's	 we can take it!! There are some very JAWSish moments with the stallion that defy belief. However the funny thing about this film is that in amongst some glaring clichés	 there are some really inventive and touching scenes. Jim putting the saddle on the stallion (VERY Horse Whisperish before its time) Jim and Jessica setting up home	 the fabulous scene where Jim shows up Alistair's riding with his trusty whip. I can see why this character is such an icon.<br /><br />Altogether a very pleasing sequel. Here's hoping everyone involved wants to make another. the Man From Snowy River III: The CRAIGS. I'm sure we'd all love to see how Jim and Jessica are doing on their farm.<br /><br />The Aussie DVD has a couple of extra scenes in it. Worthwhile if you are already a fan."	1.0
"Engrossing drama of four men on a canoing weekend down a remote river. They are pacifist Ed (Jon Voight)	 adventurous	 violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds)	 obnoxious Bobby (Ned Beatty) and nice guy Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minute are great--there's the incredible dueling banjos sequence	 interesting interplay among the characters and just stunning widescreen cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond. Then two hillbillies attack Ed and Bobby. One of them rapes Bobby...and the trip becomes a nightmare.<br /><br />Just unbelievable. The scenery is incredibly beautiful yet this horrific violence is taking place. To be truthful	 Beatty's rape has never bothered me--I'm very aware it's being faked despite the good acting. This movie also shows how the characters change--Ed has his pacifism tested	 Lewis becomes weak	 Bobby is violated by one of the people he mocked earlier on and Drew tries to keep himself sane. Direction by John Boorman is also very assured and the sounds of the forest and the river help the mood immensely.<br /><br />The acting is mostly good. Voight is just OK in the lead--he's been better. Beatty is also just OK--but it is his debut film and he has guts for taking such a risky role. Cox is very good especially when things start falling apart. And Reynolds is just superb--one of his best acting jobs EVER! How this wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award escapes me. Also Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are way too believable as the hillbillies.<br /><br />A powerful film--NOT for children. Try to see an uncut version--the TV version is butchered. Also letter-boxed viewing is essential to capture the breathtaking images."	1.0
"Wow-this one sucks. I'm gonna sum it up as quickly as possible. <br /><br />A count invites 4 naive sluts back to his castle. A bunch of nothing happens for a long time. Some lame and un-erotic soft-core sex scenes happen. Some girls get their heads cut off (off-screen)-The End.<br /><br />The only things going for this one are the decent looking sets and costumes	 some bad dubbing which leads to some unintentionally funny dialogue	 and a few brief nudie shots. And believe me-those things are not enough to redeem the 90-minutes of tedium that this film is. In fact-the best part is the tacked on beginning from the distributor that features some slutty goth chicks covered in blood and showing their tits-and again-this is definitely not worth the price of admission for this garbage. As everyone else has noted- the title of the film is completely nonsensical-as there's absolutely no bloodsucking	 nor dancing of any sort in the film at all. It may as well have been called 'The Goat-Raper Leads the Circle-Jerk'-and at least then it would have had a better title that also pertains to nothing in the film. An accurate title would have been '90 Minutes of Torture'-another alluring title that would have at least been truthful...for the viewer. Honestly-the trailer that's on the disc shows all the best parts (and i use the term 'best' extremely loosely...) so I highly suggest watching that instead if you're still curious. I can't imagine anyone liking this wreck of a film-please take my advice and leave this one on the shelf. 2/10"	0.0
"As many people know	 Mexican cinema was very poor after the so-called Golden Age of the Mexican Cinema	 fortunately	 during the late 90's	 and early 21st century	 great movies like La Ley de Herodes	 Bajo California	 Amores Perros	 Y Tu Mamá También and	 of course	 El Coronel No Tiene Quien le Escriba	 appeared. El Coronel...	 is a wonderful movie	 that retells the classic story by Gabriel García Márquez	 by eliminating the magic realism elements	 and replacing them with the crude reality lived in Mexico	 not only by people like the Colonel	 who wait for their pensions	 but by more than the half of the Mexican population	 who live in complete poverty. The film's characters	 satirically represent classic characters found in Mexican society	 such as the nationalist Colonel	 the cold and even ambitious priest	 the hypocrite	 but at the same time loyal compadre	 the tolerant and patient wife	 the hidden homosexual	 etc. This movie	 is a must-see if you want to know more about Mexican society	 and specially	 if you want to watch a gorgeous movie	 by one of Mexico's finest directors"	1.0
"This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time. Miriam Flynn is excellent as Bunny Packard. Zane Buzby as Delores is comic genius. The rest of the cast is amazing	 and the film is really really funny. A definite satire of horror films	 with a zany twist. If you enjoy a fun	 comedy filled evening	 then go and rent this classic. You'll laugh all the way through!"	1.0
"Miriam Hopkins is ""The Lady with Red Hair"" in this 1940 biopic of Mrs. Leslie Carter which also stars Claude Rains as David Belasco	 Richard Ainley as Lou Payne	 and a fine cast of supporting players	 including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory.<br /><br />Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give wonderful performances. Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for Mrs. Carter. Rains is great as the flamboyant	 egotistical producer/writer/actor/impresario David Belasco	 one of the great names in theater.<br /><br />Though Mrs. Carter's second husband	 Lou Payne	 served as adviser on this film	 it's a poor representation of the real events of Mrs. Carter's life. True	 there was a much publicized and bitter divorce	 and she was undoubtedly viewed as a scandalous character for that and for becoming an actress. However	 she had custody of her son Dudley	 so there was no custody battle. Once she broke with Belasco	 she did not go back to him and	 in fact	 started working in vaudeville and actually made some films toward the end of her life. She did indeed marry Lou	 and he became her leading man in many productions.<br /><br />The driving force for Mrs. Carter in the beginning of this film is regaining custody of her son	 but she finally realizes that in her time away from him	 he is thoroughly bonded with his father. In the film also (and I'm not sure if it was true in real life) she traveled with her mother and lived in a theatrical boarding house	 which gives the film some added interesting atmosphere.<br /><br />Not a bad movie	 probably not a depiction of the greatness of either Carter or Belasco. One of Mrs. Carter's most famous moments was in The Heart of Maryland	 where she wore a wig with six-foot tresses. Off-stage	 fans blew her hair as she hung 35 feet above the stage clutching the center of a bell to keep it from ringing. Quite a visual."	1.0
"At first glance I expected this film to be crappy because I thought the plot would be so excessively feminist. But I was wrong. As you maybe have read in earlier published comments	 I agree in that the feminist part in this film does not bother. I never had the idea that the main character was exaggerating her position as a woman. It's like Guzman is presented as somebody with a spine	 this in contrast to her classmates. So I was surprised by the story	 in fact	 I thought it was quite good	 except for the predictable end. Maybe it would've been a better idea to give the plot a radical twist	 so that the viewer is somewhat more surprised.<br /><br />In addition	 I'd like to say that Rodriguez earned her respect by the way she put away her character. I can't really explain why	 but especially in the love scenes she convinced me. It just looked real I think.<br /><br />I gave it a 7 out of 10	 merely because of the dull last half hour."	1.0
"I thought this movie was stunning	 with completely outstanding performances by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi).<br /><br />Cervi portrays Artemisia so beautifully	 with tentative yet confidant mannerisms	 her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place. The passion to which Artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch.<br /><br />Although not each character was overtly beautiful	 this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time.<br /><br />Overall i thought this film was fantastic."	1.0
"I am extremely picky about the films I see. I'd heard about Moon Child completely by accident. I've been a fan of L'Arc En Ciel for some time and a fan of Gackt and Mizer only recently.<br /><br />I finally found out the film was being re-released and picked it up without a second thought.<br /><br />Being as critical as I am about films	 I will admit	 the action scenes can be somewhat hokey at times...but they're meant too be	 as another user suggested	 it's the quintessential calm before the storm	 quoting Gary Oldman from Leon...without getting into the spoilers	 the film hit me extremely hard	 because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are limitless and as they often say	 true friendship is loyalty and like marriage	 it's until death do you part.<br /><br />Hyde and Gackt give performances that showcase why they are able to commit such depth to their song lyrics	 their passion for music happens onto the big screen and in the process it creates an exemplary film that will reach into one's soul and evoke response emotionally.<br /><br />Upon seeing the film for the first time	 I realized it will probably remain in heavy rotation as far as my collection goes. I want to encourage anyone reading this post to pick up the film if you want to get away from the current Hollywood trend in film...this takes an entirely new direction using classic Yakuza film elements and how can you go wrong with a cameo from Ryo Ishibashi of Takashi Miike's ""Audition"" and ""Suicide Club"" fame?<br /><br />Man..I just can't say enough about this film	 but I'll stop here.<br /><br />10/10"	1.0
"Kubrick meets King. It sounded so promising back in the spring of 1980	 I remember. Then the movie came out	 and the Kubrick cultists have been bickering with the King cultists ever since.<br /><br />The King cultists say Stanley Kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it. The Kubrick cultists don't give a damn about King's story. They talk about Steadicams	 tracking shots	 camera angles.This is a film	 they insist: It should be considered on its own. As it happens	 both camps are correct. Unfortunately.<br /><br />If one views it purely as an adaptation of King's novel	 ""The Shining"" is indeed a failure	 a wasted opportunity	 a series of botched narrative gambits. <br /><br />I used to blame that on Kubrick's screenwriter. The writer Diane Johnson (author of Le Marriage	 L'Affaire	 Le Divorce	 etc.) has a reputation as an novelist of social manners. Maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of conjugal relations or family dynamics. But the little blue-collar town of Sidewinder	 Colorado doesn't exist on any map in her Francophile universe. <br /><br />Kubrick the Anglophile probably found her congenial	 however. He	 of course	 is the real auteur. And considered on its own merits	 his screenplay for ""The Shining"" -- with its mishmash of abnormal psychology	 rationalism	 supernaturalism	 and implied reincarnation -- just doesn't stand up to logical analysis.<br /><br />I'm willing to consider Kubrick's ""Shining"" on its own terms. I'm even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horror-genre movie. But it doesn't succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation	 alienation	 and madness either. Parsed either way	 the film pretty much falls apart.<br /><br />Are the horrors of the Overlook Hotel real? Or do they exist only in the mind -- first as prescient nightmares suffered by little Danny Torrance	 then as the hallucinations of his father? One notes how whenever Jack Torrance is seen talking to a ""ghost"" he is in fact looking into a mirror. One notes how the hotel's frozen topiary-hedge maze appears to symbolize Jack's stunted	 convoluted psyche. Very deep stuff.<br /><br />But if indeed the Overlook's ""ghosts"" are purely manifestations of Jack Torrance's growing insanity	 then who exactly lets the trapped Jack out of the hotel kitchen's dead-bolted walk- in closet	 so that he can go on his climactic ax-wielding rampage?<br /><br />And can ANYONE explain	 with a straight face	 that black-and-white photograph (helpfully labelled ""1921"") of Nicholson as a tuxedoed party-goer that pops up out of left field and onto a hotel-ballroom wall during the film's closing seconds? Are we to seriously conclude that Jack Torrance's Bad Craziness stems from a some sort of ""past life"" experience? (And if you swallow that	 since when are reincarnated people supposed to be exact physical replicas their past selves?)<br /><br />Maybe Kubrick didn't care about his storyline. Maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror. Whatever the case	 the film tries to hedge its narrative bets -- to have it both ways	 rational and supernatural. As a result	 the story is a mess. This movie hasn't improved with age	 and it certainly doesn't improve with repeated viewings.<br /><br />I don't deny that a few moments of fear	 claustrophobia	 and general creepiness are scattered throughout this long	 long film. But those gushing Elevators o' Blood	 seen repeatedly in little Danny's visions	 are absurd and laughable. And Jack Torrance's infamous tag lines (""Wendy	 I'm home!"" and ""Heeeeeere's JOHNNY!"") merely puncture the movie's dramatic tension and dissipate its narrative energy. (I know: I sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief: ""Whew! Glad we don't have to take this stuff seriously!"") Finally	 Kubrick is completely at sea -- or else utterly cynical -- during those scenes in which Wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to puree their son. A foyer full of mummified guests	 all sitting there dead in their party hats? Yikes	 now I really am afraid.<br /><br />Given Jack Nicholson's brilliance over the years	 one can only assume that he gave just the sort of eyeball-rolling	 eyebrow-wiggling	 scenery-chomping performance that the director wanted. The performance of Shelley Duvall	 as a sort of female version of Don Knotts in ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken	"" is best passed over in silence.<br /><br />This movie simply doesn't succeed -- not as an adaptation	 not on its own terms. It probably merits a 3 out of 10	 but I'm giving it a 1 because it has been so GROTESQUELY over-rated in this forum."	0.0
"When Stanwyck's husband-to-be is murdered on the eve of their wedding	 she retreats to a mountain lodge	 where she slips (sort of) off a cliff and is rescued by wealthy attorney Morgan. Morgan falls in love with her	 leading to a definitely one-sided marriage	 spent on a huge estate in Chicago (which appears to be surrounded by mountains!). Stanwyck is tempted by dashing Cortez	 but eventually returns to Morgan	 in a very subdued and unconvincing story resolution.<br /><br />This film has a great cast (Morgan in particular is one of my favorites) and a great director	 but the script is meandering and seems pointless at times. I was so ready to enjoy this movie but I was ultimately disappointed. Still worth watching for the cast	 and it's good for anyone who likes 1930s films."	0.0
"2003 was seen as the year of the Matrix	 with the release of two sequels and a computer game that actually linked to the plot of the film. Also released was a DVD of 9 short animated films	 most written and made in Japan and made as Anime. Japan makes some of the best animation in the world. Sadly most of these shorts are disappointing. The best of them is the first part of a prequel to the first Matrix film.<br /><br />The Second Renaissance is made as a historical file. It tells how humans made machines in their own likeness. Humans live the high life whilst machines are the grunts	 the workers of society	 second class citizens. In the year 2090	 a machine	 BI-66ER was put of trial for murder	 after killing his owners who wanted to deactivate him. The machine does not have a fair trial and riots start around the world. The governments of the world order to dismantle machines. Many machines leave human society and form their own country in the Middle East	 O1. 01 has a productive economy and easily undercut the human nations	 forcing them into economic crisis. The human blockade 01 and reject the machines requests for peace	 thereby it was the humans who were responsible for the war that enslaves them.<br /><br />The Second Renaissance is a interesting watch	 with excellent	 traditional animation style and sets a compelling world. It shows how the machines were mistreated and that humanity sowed the seeds of their own destruction. There is a political and social world and the short tells a lot in it short running time. The short shares themes and a style to the classic silent film Metropolis	 partly the beginning with the underworld. They are the themes of slavery	 the mistreatment of the working class and racism. The short also has some religious themes and religious iconography. Mainly that men saw themselves as God and created the machines in their own likeness. Seeing themselves as the rightful masters of the machines. The machines too use religious iconography	 mainly forming their nation in 'cradle of human civilisation' and the machines coming to the United Nations dressed as Adam and Eve	 offering an apple.<br /><br />The animation style is beautiful	 done in the traditional anime style (like Akira). The set designs are great	 combine futuristic with historic cities	 e.g. Washington D.C.. There is well down future scene	 and surprising violence	 which is key to the film. The director	 Mahiro Maeda	 also directed the anime sequence in Kill Bill Vol. 1	 so has good credentials to Hollywood. He is willing to use violence and know how to keep a story going.<br /><br />The only real complain is a continuity error to the first Matrix film because Morpheus mentions that the humans have no historical records or know who started the war. But its a good watch."	1.0
"I like this film for several reasons. I have a soft spot for films about intricately plotted criminal plots like TOPKAPI. I also enjoy films (like TOPKAPI and BIG DEAL ON MADONNA STREET) that spoof the the genre. One of the best ones is DISORGANIZED CRIME.<br /><br />Corbin Bernsen has met four cons over the years	 and he decides they can all be useful in a bank robbery he is planning in a small Montana town. But he hasn't given any details on the crime to the fellows	 nor do they really know each other at all. Shortly after he sends for them Bernsen is arrested by two New Jersey policemen (Ed O'Neill and Daniel Roebuck) whom he escaped from before and have a warrant to bring him back. While he is in their custody the four cons (Fred Gwynne	 Lou Diamond Philips	 Ruben Blades	 and Will Russ) show up without a clue about why they are there except that Bernsen was planning something. <br /><br />The first twenty minutes of the film deal with the four cons slowly getting used to each other	 with Gwynne and Philips managing to push away their own suspicions to figure out they have to trust each other. At the same time we see Bernsen patiently waiting for the right moment to escape from O'Neill and Roebuck again - not too difficult as they are not the brightest bulbs who ever existed. The result are two sets of plots that will keep juxtaposing against each other throughout the film: the four cons trying to figure out what Bernsen's scheme was	 and how to put it into operation	 and Bernsen trying to maintain his own freedom from his pursuers and regain his cabin (and hopefully find his gang there for him to take command of). There is also a third	 smaller	 plot involving the growing annoyance and anger of local Sheriff Hoyt Axton against the idiots from New Jersey who keep getting into his hair.<br /><br />There are many delightful moments in the film	 such as Axton	 egged on by O'Neil and Roebuck	 into surrounding a house in the town that Bernsen is supposed to be hiding inside of	 and yelling (through a megaphone	 ""Come out	 we have you surrounded!!""	 only to have the scene switch to a huge	 Montana plain that Bernsen is struggling and stumbling through miles from where the police think he is at that moment. There are moments of misadventures by our four cons	 who fortunately put the oldest (Gwynne) into leadership position. This does not always guarantee anything. At one point their car won't start	 and they have to thumb a ride by truck. Unfortunately it is a truck carrying manure.<br /><br />The conclusion with the gang successfully carrying out the robbery	 including disabling all the police cars at the critical time (Philips specialty is cars) is also a gem of timing	 suspense	 and comic results. The film is very entertaining	 and certainly worth watching."	1.0

"It must be the most corniest TV show on the air. This is probably a escape for Jim Belushi and all of his bad movies. His brother sucked all the talent out he younger brother.

If i here a joke from that show i will throw up and and wash my eyes out with a toothbrush. Id rather be taken from the devil himself than watch a full half hour that piece of programing. I still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running. We all know deep down that we want to shoot our TV screens when we see Jim's face. In conclusion	 no more please."	0.0
"Handsome and dashing British airline pilot George Taylor (a solid portrayal by Guiseppe Pambieri) gets beat up by thugs after a wild night in Hong Kong. George meets and falls in love with the sweet and virginal Dr. Emy Wong (a fine and charming performance by the lovely Chai Lee). George regains his health and goes back to work. When Emy fails to hear from George for a lengthy amount of time	 she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute. While director/co-writer Bitto Albertini does indeed deliver a satisfying amount of the expected tasty nudity and steamy soft-core sex	 this film is anything but your routine wallow in leering sleaze. Instead it's a surprisingly thoughtful	 touching and tragic love story between two well drawn and highly appealing characters (Chai as Emy Wong is especially radiant and endearing). The picture starts out bubbly and cheerful	 but the tone radically shifts into a more grim and harsh mood about two thirds of the way through. Emy's descent into vice after she falsely assumes that George has abandoned her is bleak and upsetting; ditto the remarkably sad and heartbreaking surprise bummer ending. Granted	 the narrative is certainly melodramatic	 but never too silly or trashy. Moreover	 the sex scenes are quite tasteful and even genuinely erotic. Notorious Italian porn star Ilona Staller has a nice sizable supporting part as George's jealous and uninhibited secretary Helen Miller. Guido Mancori's polished cinematography offers many strikingly gorgeous shots of the exotic locations. Nico Fidenco's funky	 throbbing score hits the groovy spot. Worth a look for those seeking something different."	1.0
"My mother worked with Dennis L. Raider for eleven years	 not to mention shared an office with him. When it was announced he was BTK	 she was shocked. The whole day was just her telling stories about how she never would have seen him as the Wichita Killer. I've heard her re-tell them many times. I've inquired her about a lot of things	 and gone to all the interviews that she was asked to go to. I've read the entire book written about Raider	 Wichita is my hometown and I was surprised that such a thing could happen in Kansas.<br /><br />There was another BTK movie on TV not too long ago	 and I thought this one would have been better at portraying Dennis' killings	 maybe even have some intelligent touches to his motives.<br /><br />I'm going to be very blunt with the flaws in this movie. This is based on my mom's portrayal of him	 all my readings on him	 and the video tapes I've seen of him talking.<br /><br />First of all	 the camera angles were horrible. It looked as though it had been shot on a home video camera. The acting was terrible and I couldn't even bear to watch it.<br /><br />Dennis Raider never had long hair. Dennis Raider was a ""very anal man"" and was a ""follow the rule book"" kind of guy. He wasn't as nice as the movie made him look	 he was very polite and abrupt	 business like. Same goes for his killings	 as far as we all know. If you've seen his confession in court	 you can already guess.<br /><br />And as for the obsession with the slaughter house? No. Never have I read or has Dennis Raider confessed to having a problem with animal cruelty or people squishing bugs. In fact	 he practiced on cats and dogs for choking methods. Yet through-out the whole movie he was putting animals in his victim's faces and acting like he cared about the well-being of them.<br /><br />Dennis Raider never killed the people that he knew	 he confessed this	 but in the movie in his first killing he tells the lady he knows her also.<br /><br />I really don't even want to go in to this movie	 and I'm already ranting. This is NOT what you want to watch if you are interested in the actual happenings of BTK. This is NOT what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie. If you want a badly shot half-porno with some slaughter scenes served the side	 then this is your kind of movie."	0.0
"I was always curious about this film because it is so tough to find	 so when I stumbled upon it on Ebay I forked over the $10 and bought it	 now I understand why its so rare! This film is SO bad	 so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the ending credits	 which show all of the cut scenes where they fumbled their lines	 are literally the movie's highlight. The film is about a psychic (Pettyjohn	 cast for one obvious reason	 her topless scene) whom uses her powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality. When she pulls in some kind of box like object the military nonchalantly throws it into the open back of a truck with one soldier to guard it	 and gee	 what do you know? SURPRISE! A kid in a foam-rubber monster costume pops out	 instantly kills the soldier with a scratch across his face	 then escapes to a nearby city. But rather than deploy half the armed forces of the county to find it and protect the public those in charge just leave it up to Pettyjohn and Ray to find it on their own	 but no matter	 this movie blows all its credibility LONG before then. This barely escapes being voted a 1 by me only because of unintentional laughs	 somebody needs to alert the producers of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" if they don't know about it already! 2 out 10	 really	 REALLY bad!"	0.0
"John Thaw is a an excellent actor. I have to admit that I was impressed by his range in the role of a crusty old curmudgeon who reluctantly agrees to take in an evacuee from the streets of London (WWII time era).<br /><br />That being said	 the film is also excellent. A very moving story with a satisfying ending. Some of the characters are a little underdeveloped (the school teacher in particular)	 but none of them are essential to the plot. Basically	 the story is about the old man and the boy	 and the film needs little else."	1.0
"I was lying on my bed	 with a really bad cold or flu or whatever. I figure maybe I'd kill some time watching some horror movies my mom bought for me a little while ago. I wish I never picked this movie! After I watched it I felt even more sick and I wanted to throw up. Afterwords(when I got better of course) I did some research on Dennis L.Rader and I noticed that the Dennis in the movie was nothing like the real one. I hope that no one ever watches this movie but if they ever do don't eat or you'll feel the way I felt after I first watched it. I think you would have a better time watching The Santa Claus 3. At least that movie had better reviews on this site."	0.0
"This is a bit long (2 hours	 20 minutes) but it had a a lot of the famous Pearl Buck novel in it. In other words	 a lot of ground to cover.<br /><br />It was soap-operish at times but had some visually dramatic moments	 too	 capped off by a locust attack at the end of the film. That was astounding to view. Considering this film is about 70 years old	 the special-effects crew on this film did a spectacular job.<br /><br />Paul Muni and Luise Rainer were award-winning actors in their day and they don't disappoint here	 both giving powerful performances. The only problem is credibility as all the Asians are played by Caucasions and some of them	 like Walter Connolly	 just don't look real. I'd like to see a re-make of this movie with all-Asian actors	 not for PC reasons but to simply make the story look and sound more credible."	1.0
"I'm not a huge Star Trek fan	 but I was looking forward to this. I was intrigued by the pre-hype descriptions of the Enterprise	 its cramped-submarine styling and rough-edged technology compared to the Treks we are used to.<br /><br />I didn't see anything all that interesting in this pilot. I found the plot to be convoluted and confusing.<br /><br />I will admit that I did like some of the character development - the depictions of the humans as an 'adolescent' species ready to outgrow their britches was entertaining.<br /><br />And that Vulcan babe had one hell of an incredible rack.<br /><br />But I don't think I'm going to get hooked on this series.<br /><br />3/10"	0.0
"A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy's work	 Rivers and Tides allows fans to see his work in motion. Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces	 one develops an appreciation for every stone	 leaf	 and thorn that he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life	 the rivers	 and the tides inspires and affects his work. Although	 I was happy the film covered the majority of Goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs)	 I do feel it was a bit long.

"When I first saw this film	 I thought it should have come from the children's section - It's very fun and at times humorous	 and is actually quite a good story	 but it severely lacks the ""romantic chemistry"" that actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are capable of delivering. I must note that Walter Matthau is perfect for the part of Albert Einstein	 and his performance is extraordinary	 but that's the sole exception. This film appears a bit forced	 the directing lacks substance	 and oh yeah...the music is ridiculously awful	 it didn't put me in a very good mood. But if you are not expecting a smart	 well-crafted comedy/romance tale	 then this certainly can be entertaining	 like I said..it should be in the children's section. Einstein and his buddies are a good relief from Tim Robbins' boring	 almost tense quest to steal Meg Ryan's heart. A very conflicting film	 but as long as it's not taken seriously this can be an alright movie."	0.0
"My roommates & I nearly shorted out our TV from the numerous spit-takes we did while watching this hilarious piece of 1970s self important pseudo-zen dreck. I'd read about this campfest for ages and scanned my local late night TV listings for YEARS in search of this elusive turd. Several years ago our local ABC affiliate was known for showing cool flicks for its late night weekend flick (ie ""Frogs""	 ""Night of the Lepus""	 etc). Then one day it happened: at 1:40am on a Saturday night (over 5 years ago) there it was! We had over 15 folks over and the flick did NOT disappoint!<br /><br />See! Andy Griffith as the silliest & most unthreatening bad guy since Jaye Davidson in ""Stargate""!<br /><br />See! William Shatner sport a variety of things atop his head that only faintly resemble human hair (or anything organic for that matter).<br /><br />Hear! jaw droppingly inane 1970s psychobabble that makes ""Chicken Soup For The Soul"" sound like BF Skinner<br /><br />Feel! Content that any decade was better than the 70s.<br /><br />For those still reading...the plot surrounds a bunch of middle class mid level a--holes who decide to suck up to their s---head boss (Griffith) by joining him on a cross dessert race that spans California & Mexico. They all wear leather jackets	 looking more Christopher Street than anything else. Along the way they stop at a Cantina	 get drunk	 smoke joints (the sight Robert ""Mike Brady"" Reed smoke a joint is an image you won't soon forget)	 start a fight	 attempt rape	 and just act like a bunch of suburban middle class jack offs. Although I have an excellent copy that I taped off TV I WISH this one would be released on video so the whole world could enjoy its half baked goofiness."	0.0
"Admittedly	 I find Al Pacino to be a guilty pleasure. He was a fine actor until Scent of a Woman	 where he apparently overdosed on himself irreparably. I hoped this film	 of which I'd heard almost nothing growing up	 would be a nice little gem. An overlooked	 ahead-of-its-time	 intelligent and engaging city-political thriller. It's not.<br /><br />City Hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters	 names	 and ""realistic"" citywide issues	 that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and implicating	 that once you find out the truth	 it will blow your mind. In truth	 however	 these subplots and digressions result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story trademarks such as Corruption of Power	 Two-Faced Politicians	 Mafia with Police ties	 etc. And theoretically	 this setup allows for some thrilling tension	 the fear that none of the characters are safe	 and anything could happen! But again	 it really doesn't.<br /><br />Unfortunately	 the only things that happen are quite predictable	 and we're left with several ""confession"" monologues	 that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts	 a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the ""real world"" of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spider-web of lies and cover-ups	 the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal.

"Fantastic movie. One to excite all 5 senses. Is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information. True Hollywood conventions used	 like playing A list and VERY attractive actors as the 'heroes'	 such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's lover)	 Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned's right hand man)	 and unattractive (sorry Geoffrey Rush) actors play the drunken and corrupt Victorian Police Force. This also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to entice all the romantics	 females being especially susceptible. Even from the first scene	 when Ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him ""sunshine"" and had a ""glint in his eye as he looked down at me	 his hand on me shoulder	"" it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with Ned Kelly	 the underdog. Besides	 don't all Aussies love an underdog?"	1.0
"This movie is BAD! It's basically an overdone copy of Michael Jackson's Thriller video	 only worse! The special effects consist of lots of glow in the dark paint	 freaky slapstick fastmoving camera shots and lots of growling. I think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie."	0.0
"The King of Masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship. Set in 1930s China during a time of floods	 we meet Wang	 an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him. When a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends Wang	 he invites Wang to join their troupe. However	 we learn that Wang's family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son. Learning that Wang is childless	 Wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever. Taking the advice to heart	 Wang purchases an 8 year old to fulfill his legacy; he would teach his new son	 Doggie	 the ancient art of silk masks. Soon	 Wang discovers a fact about Doggie that threatens the rare and dying art.<br /><br />Together	 Wang and Doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it. The story is absorbing. The setting is serene and the costuming simple. Summarily	 it is an International Award winning art film which can't help but to move and inspire."	1.0
"WOW! Why would anybody make a sequel to an already rancid film? Half Past Dead was a bad movie but at least at had an idea of what it wanted to be. HPD2 has no clue of what it wants to be. It just exists on screen for reasons I cant explain. Spoiler: The whole movie is this: Twitch(played by Kurupt of Tha Dogg Pound) gets transferred to another jail where there might be a box filled with gold bricks buried. In the jail	 a riot breaks out between rival inmates	 one of them gets shot by a guy named Cortez and Cortez plans his escape. During a conjugal visit	 Twitch's fiancée and Burke's(played by Bill Goldberg)daughter get kidnapped by Cortez and are held in an execution room. Burke reluctantly befriends Twitch and they end up getting into trouble with the idiotic inmates while finding out that Cortez has their loved ones.<br /><br />Opinion: This is the most unnecessary sequel since Universal Soldier: The Return. The script is terrible	 the acting is horrendous	 the dialog is a joke and everybody in this movie is a caricature. Look	 I know it was low budget film but that is not an excuse for these guys to not put effort into what they do. Nobody in this ""movie"" believes in the characters they play. Nobody in this ""movie can be taken seriously as an actor. Kurupt should be ashamed of himself. His character ""Twitch"" is pretty much a spineless minstrel puppet who spends most of his time posing while getting jacked up by Burke or the other inmates. Bill Goldberg spends most of his time sulking throughout the movie as if he had to take a PHD(pretty huge dump). The fight scenes are poorly choreographed and pathetic and for an action movie HPD2 is pretty boring even when action is happening! Don't let anybody tell you that this movie is somewhat decent. It stinks and is a prime reason why people despise Follywood."	0.0
"Other reviewers have summarized this film noir well. I just wanted to add to the ""Whew!"" comment one reviewer made regarding Elisha Cook's obviously coke-fuelled drumming episode. This WAS a doozy	 I must say. Cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performance.<br /><br />A bit of trivia that I am surmising about: Cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 Barbara Stanwyck film	 ""Ball of Fire."" He was a waiter in the nightclub where Barbara was singing and legendary drummer Gene Krupa was drumming	 most energetically. Is it too much to suggest that Cook's spazzy drumming in the later film	 ""Phantom Lady	"" was very much inspired by Krupa's work	 as witnessed by Cook 3 years earlier? <br /><br />If you watch Krupa in ""Ball of Fire	"" I think you'll note some clearly similar body movements. One hopes	 of course	 that HE was not influenced by any drugs at the time!"	1.0
"Oh it's so cool to watch a Silent Classic once in while! Director Vidor is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy (at least for 1928) cameo as himself. The story is about having success in life and the way it changes you. Marion Davies plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger ""drama"" studio. She becomes a big star and the consequences are she really alienates from the real world. For a moment she even denies her (poor) past! The cameos are simply hilarious	 certainly the scene where the main character (Marion Davies) sees...Marion Davies in the studios and concludes she doesn't seem that special... It's got to be one of the first movie-in-the-movies here and for real freaks it's awesome to see the cameras and material from way back then. A must-see if you ask me!!"	1.0
"The ending of this movie made absolutely NO SENSE. What a waste of 2 perfectly good hours. If you can explain it to me...PLEASE DO. I don't usually consider myself unable to ""get"" a movie	 but this was a classic example for me	 so either I'm slower than I think	 or this was a REALLY bad movie."	0.0
"I know I know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome. I love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time I was impressed with Darth Vader turning against the Emperor I really stayed astonished. The anguishing sequence in that film was when Luke is tortured and defeated by the Emperor/Darth Sidious. He is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader	 Dark Lord of the Sith	 eliminates his dark master. A nice sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is impressive. I was surprised with all the vessels of the Rebel Battle ships and all Imperial War Ships and Super Star Destroyers. I loved the new race they brought on screen the Mon Calomari	 the ewoks	 the sullesteian (Lando's co pilot) and many more... Most of my favorite scenes are in that film:1-When Vader destroys the Emperor and is fatally wounded. 2- When Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda and then it shows up Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw)(the greatest scene in Star Wars) 3- When LEia slays Jabba strangling the Hutt crime lord.<br /><br />I personally like the script and the battle of Endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of Star Wars between Darth Vader V.s Luke Skywalker on the Death Star. Post-script: The scenes with Leia in the slave bikini are memorable. 9/10."	1.0
"The performances in this movie were fantastic. The dialogue was great. Jason Patric delivered a fantastic performance as ""Kid"" Collins in this wonderful adaptation of the Jim Thompson novel. Far superior to ""The Grifters""	 which was a good movie	 this film really stayed true to the pulp fiction/film noir roots from which the story came. I recommend this movie to all film noir fans."	1.0
"This movie was an impressive one. My first experience with a foreign film	 it was neither too long	 nor too complex. I myself enjoyed the subtitles; and the plot was surprisingly fresh. The story of an adult son visiting his elderly father and retarded brother after a long separation appeared cliched at first	 but it proved to be very touching and realistic. There was also some subtle humor so as not to depress or bore the audience."	1.0
"It was a bit bizarre and evil and i enjoyed it a lot	 the characters in the show were great as well	 and complimented one another well. I was sorry to see it cut off.. I would have loved to see where it could have went.You found yourself leaning toward Lucas Buck the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone. Lucas was frightening and alluring. And I would have liked to have seen more of him and how his character became. I will however buy the show just to enjoy	 it was great to something different on TV. And Paige Turrco who was Caleb's cousin	 she was a big mystery as to where and what she meant to Lucas. Its a shame it isn't around still.. or was never finished	 i would have loved to see what would have happened."	1.0
"Mindless dribble about the second coming of Christ in the form of a hippie and albino looking Sandra Locke. You have no idea what's happening on the screen with the irritating theme song ""Suzanne"" being played over and over throughout the movie until when ""The Second Coming of Suzanne"" is over you already know it by hard no matter how hard you try to forget the whole thing.<br /><br />This off-the-wall armature movie maker Logan	Jared Martin	 is out to make the movie of the century but is so rude and obnoxious that none in the banking world is willing to finance his project. Planning to go on his own Logan then spots this couple at a seaside café and is fascinated with the young woman Suzanne	 Sandra Locke	 who reminds him of someone he knew in another life: Jesus Christ.<br /><br />With Logan's assistant and all around gofer Clavius	 Richard Dreyfuss	somehow getting a $740	000.00 loan from the bank to finance Logan's masterpiece he starts to work on Suzanne by flattering her about her talent as an actress in order to get her interested to be in his film. This leads to Suzanne not only leaving her boyfriend artist Simon	 Paul Sand	 but later Simon being so depressed and feeling all alone takes a gun to his mouth and blows his brains out.<br /><br />The movie also has two somewhat unrelated sub-plots in it that has to do with a young autistic girl Dorothy	 Kari Avalos	 who's cured of her autism by Suzanne after everyone else	 at the psychiatric hospital that she was committed to	failed. It's not really known what exactly Suzanne was doing at the hospital but she seemed to be some kind of orderly or volunteer there; was this supposed to show us in the audience that she	 like Jesus	 could miraculously heal the sick?<br /><br />There's also this newspaper columnist and big time businessman tycoon Jackson Sinclair	 Gene Barry	 who seems to be either going through a very difficult mid-life crisis or has seen a biblical-like vision that changed his life forever. Sinclair had been searching for the meaning of life as well as what it's all about all through the movie and wanted to know why there's all this suffering in the world	 like this movie that he's in	 and seemed to have found the answer when he first laid his eyes on Suzanne. Sinclair also got some sense knocked into his head when his private chauffeur David	 Mark Rasmusser	 who's gotten sick and tired of his weird and crazy hallucinations almost running him off a cliff in a kamikaze like drive along the Pacific Coast.<br /><br />The movie ""The Second Coming of Suzanne"" goes on with a number of unrelated sequences	 probably to fill or pad in some time by it's director and film editor	 and then goes to it's final scene in a Christ-like crucification on a hill as Logan has all the cameras rolling. It turns out that the crazed Logan got so carried away with his masterpiece as he tried to replicate	 on the helpless and tied up Suzanne	 the actual crucification of Jesus Christ some 2	000 years ago.<br /><br />Hard to sit through and almost impossible to follow ""The Second Coming of Suzanne"" puts you through the same kind torture that Suzanne is put through by Logan and the makers of the film. The movie tries to be arty but that's just an excuse to cover up it's brainless and non-existent storyline and even worse the terrible and amateurish acting by everyone in it."	0.0
"It's not a terrible movie	 really	 and Glenn and Keitel are top-notch actors. Further	 they do an acceptable job with the very weak script. The scenery is lush and the plot has some interesting twists. Further	 I umderstand why these actors and the crew made the film	 they are professionals and they get paid for it. But I do wonder why studios spend the time and money to make a film and then don't release it for theater audiences? Even if a film is a box-office flop	 surely it makes some money. If you are a fan of Keitel or Glenn	 rent the video or catch it on TV	 as did I. Granted	 the movie won't help solve the immigration quandary with Mexico	 but the experience is far better than 90% of the standard TV fare of today."	0.0
"My daughter	 her friends and I have watched this movie literally dozens of times. I bought it twice and some little girlfriends absconded with it. Subsequently	 I rented it so very many times.

Without a doubt	 this was and is my most favourite movie of my daughter's childhood...it has it all! We laughed	 we cried	 we discussed real life and how hard some children have it in the world.

It reminded me very much of Fried Green Tomatoes At The Whistlestop Cafe. <br /><br />The story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connections are. Some people have said this is a kids movie. I disagree - it may be made by Disney and many characters are children	 but I am 23 and I LOVED it! There were moments when my spine tingled. The story is unlike any other film these days	 full of adventure. I have just ordered the book from amazon	 can't wait!"	1.0
"This is something new.<br /><br />There's a coup d'etat and a couple of irish documentary filmmakers are right inside of it.<br /><br />A democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to read the constitution is being slandered by the private media openly as dictator	 mentally unstable	 new hitler	 etc. without repercussion from the governments side (like	 say	 silencing them via bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods). Oh	 and they still claim that they are being suppressed	 of course.<br /><br />See how the media gloats about their own role in the coup d'etat on TV after they toppled the government with the help of rouge generals (how much more stupid can you get?? ).<br /><br />And see how the people of Venezuela march to the palace	 holding the constitution in their hands	 and reinstall their elected government.<br /><br />This sounds like a Hollywood fairytale	 but it happened for real	 against the explicit wishes of the USA. The documentary is a historical masterpiece	 shot from the center of the action	 acute and totally embarrassing for the prime supporters of the coup: The good	 democratic	 freedom loving	 benevolent USA (who still channel large amounts of money to Chavez' political opponents).<br /><br />Also highly entertaining and exciting. 10 points."	1.0

Why did it sound like the husband kept calling her Appy ? It ruined a great episode and so I can only give it a 6. Proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film.<br /><br />It was very Hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though I dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die. The more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining.<br /><br />I do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre. <br /><br />6/10 come on Yankies get your English up to par !	1.0
"There are so many goofy things about this movie that I can't possibly name but a few:<br /><br />BOGART's character: 1. His name  Whip McCord (too easy	 so I'll leave it at that. Boy	 it makes `Humphrey' sound good.) 2. His long	 curly hair and silly sideburns. 3. His Black Bart get-up	 complete with spurs! 4. Not sure what shade of lipgloss they've got him wearing	 but it ain't none too flattering.<br /><br />CAGNEY's character (Jim Kincaid ): 1. His lipstick doesn't do him any favors	 either. 2. The man is being swallowed by his hat during the entire film! Could they not find a hat to fit him? Even a LITTLE?!!?! 3. His pants are too tight in the rear. 4. He blows the smoke off his gun one too many times	 if you know what I mean	 and I think you do.<br /><br />If you are a casual Bogart or Cagney fan	 and figure it might be a change of pace to see them in a western	 do yourself a favor and forget that thought. EVEN THE HORSES LOOK EMBARRASSED! (That is	 when they don't look bored.)<br /><br />In all fairness	 I admit that westerns are my least favorite film genre	 but I've still seen much	 MUCH better than this.<br /><br />On a comedy level	 or as high camp	 The Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise	 it's viewer beware. Therefore	 see this only if a) you must see every western out there b) you are a TRUE Cagney or Bogie completist c) any of the above comments appeal to you.

"My title above says it all. Let me make it clearer. If you have seen the BBC's ""Planet Earth"" 	 which I am sure most of you have 	 then you are not gonna like this movie too much. And I own all the discs of ""Planet Earth"" I had seen the rating for this movie very high 	 and read good reviews about it. I was excited to check it out.<br /><br />Alas	 I went to the theater and the movie started 	 I saw it was a Disney movie with production companies listing BBC and Discovery. And when they started the first scenes about the polar bear	 I recognized them from my DVDs at home of ""Planet Earth"".<br /><br />The movie continued and went on and on and on 	 me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all from ""Planet Earth"".<br /><br />We were very very disappointed 	 as I think 90% of the footage is from ""Planet Earth"" . I am saying 90% 	 because some of the scenes I didn't recognize. I have a feeling that I simply didn't remember them.<br /><br />So finally what this movie really is 	 is a compilation of different footages from the different discs of ""Planet Earth"" 	 with a narration aimed at kids. Yes	 the narration is quite kiddish. Let me give you an example. When they show the polar cubs walking away from the mother cub 	 the narrator says ""The polar cubs are not like human kids. They don't always listen to their mothers"" ( I don't remember the exact words 	 but this is how it is ) So in a nutshell. This is condensed ""Planet Earth"" for kids !"	0.0
"Pedantic	 overlong fabrication which attempts to chronicle the birth of the Federal Bureau of Investigations. Begins quite promisingly	 with a still-relevant probe into an airplane explosion	 however the melodrama involving James Stewart and wife Vera Miles just gets in the way (Miles had a habit of playing tepid wives under duress	 and her frayed nerves arrive here right on schedule). Esteemed director Mervyn LeRoy helmed this adaptation of Don Whitehead's book	 but despite the talent involved	 the picture fails to make much of an impression. Best performance is turned in by Murray Hamilton as Stewart's partner	 however most of the dialogue is ludicrous and the dogged pacing causes the movie to seem twice as long as it is. *1/2 from ****"	0.0

"Alexandre Aja's remake of The Hills Have Eyes was one of the bright spots of 2006. Not only was it a remake of a classic horror film	 but it was pretty damned good too. So	 nearly a year later	 we are being treated to the sequel to that remake. While original scripter Wes Craven is back as producer and co scripted	 this film just fails to rise to the level set by the original and the remake. A group of military trainees stop by in the desert to check in on some scientists and find themselves run afoul of the mutant family from the first film (at least those that remain plus some new ones). There's plenty of gore to be had here. What annoys me about this film is the utter lack of characterization. The viewer does not give a damn about what happens to any of these people because we haven't gotten into them. Even the mutants had some characterization last time out and this time	 nothing. Gore for the sake of gore is pointless. There has to be a reason for this to happen for it to be interesting. Nothing that happens here is interesting. And what is it lately with rape scenes in films? Here we get yet another one for no real reason. Hopefully this is one set of hills that won't be visited again."	0.0

"Please Note: I see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film. I saw the sound version and it was esthetically yicky. Considering some indicate that the original version was LONGER and without crappy dubbing	 my review must be read with this in mind.<br /><br />Although I know that Rene Clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and Louise Brooks has a bit of a cult following as well	 this is in many ways a technically poorly made film. While Hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929	 up through the early to almost the mid-30s	 a lot of famous French films were essentially silent films--with some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film. The lip movements in many	 and in particular this film	 don't even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an American like Ms. Brooks could do a French film. This is just sloppy and I would have preferred they had just made a silent film--and as a silent film this is would have been an average film--with excellent camera work (at times) and some decent silent-style acting.<br /><br />The problem I also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot. For a silent morality play circa 1920	 it would have been fine	 but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary (that means ""old""--not ""slutty""). A lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancé can't handle it. She gives it all up	 temporarily	 but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end! A tad melodramatic	 huh? And also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped.<br /><br />Finally	 the character of the fiancé's friend(?) I found very disturbing and unreal. He looked like Harold Lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else. As he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about	 his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean-spirited. Were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused? This seems to me that's what is implied and I don't like it at all.<br /><br />There are FAR better French films of the era (Le Million	 La Femme du Boulanger	 Fanny	 Regain	 and others) as well as better silent films. I just can't understand this film's high rating."	0.0
"I can understand how fans of filmmaker Roman Polanski could love this movie- and I could understand how some could totally hate it (Ebert was one of the few who couldn't understand why people weren't running out of the theater). After a first viewing	 I'm not sure I could fall into either category	 however as someone who can't get enough of Kafka and bizarre dark comedies of paranoia The Tenant is effective enough for its running time. Or maybe not- this is one of those cases where it might have been more of a masterwork if it were a half-hour Twilight Zone episode	 with Serling delivering the coda as Terkovsky (or whomever it might be(?)) writhes in his bed in bandages. It's very similar in the treatment of the doomed protagonist as Repulsion was	 however it could be argued that there was more ambiguity	 more of a sense of the surreal coming out through a sustained disintegration of character and location (and	 quite frankly	 a better lead performance) than the Tenant.<br /><br />As it stands	 The Tenant does have an intriguing premise	 the kind that one doesn't tire telling about to other people: Polanski is a Polish émigré to Paris who takes an apartment that was most recently acquired by Simone Choule	 who jumped to her near death out of the window and died soon after. But the other tenants are conservative to the max in terms of noise; after a Saturday night at Terkovsky's with a few friends	 there are complaints of too much noise. It won't happen again	 Polanski's good-natured but slightly nervous tenant says	 but there is no peace even in moving a cabinet or a chair. Soon complaints get registered against another tenant	 but from him? Can he register complaints? This is a case of not so much mistaken identity but of there being a lack of peace of mind with oneself and the surrounding people. As the downward spiral goes on	 Polanski ratchets up tension (and	 dare I say	 black-comedic laughs) by showing Terkovsky in the midst of a horrible dream- one of Polanski's strongest scenes from the period- and in finding teeth in the wall	 not to mention the bathroom across the way (which	 I might add	 is always a cinematic lynch-pin of horror and surreal madness).<br /><br />But somehow	 the film never really feels all that significant aside from its excessive design as a would-be mind-f*** machine	 with Terkovsky's tenants only seeming to not be what they seem for a little while: there's not as much suspense when finding out that they really aren't out to get him	 which makes the paranoia more self-fulfilling. At least once or twice I thought to myself as well 'why did Polanski take the title role for himself?' It's not that he's at all a bad actor	 and he has appeared in several films and plays that aren't of his own direction. But aside from being great at looking awkward and tense	 like in the church	 or in his moments of sort of flipping out when thinking that they really are out to get him to kill himself	 his transformation is less creepy than tongue-in-cheek	 a test of himself to see if he can pull it off	 which he doesn't entirely do. Despite Polanski working at it well to look like the meek and frazzled Terkovsky	 I could see at least a few other actors who could pull it off with more subtlety and affecting personality. By the time one sees him in drag	 it goes between cringe-worthy and true camp	 particularly when he goes for the double-climax at the end (which	 of course	 is of little surprise).<br /><br />And yet there is pleasure for the film-buff and Polanski fan to see the supporting cast try and dig into the much more ambiguous characters (Winters and Douglas do this the best	 even as they have to strain through limited characters)	 and the unexpected moments like Polanski and Adjani getting hot and heavy during a Bruce Lee movie	 or when he gets really drunk	 or in one almost random scene where he slaps a kid near a fountain	 are rather brilliant in and of themselves. It's a very good film	 and one that could maybe stick my attention up when on too many coffees after midnight. But an essential film? Not exactly."	1.0
"It was difficult to sit through this horrible heretical adaptation of Sherlock Holmes. Apparently Matt Frewer was cast because he is tall and skinny. His skull-like face made for a good zombie in the Dawn of the Dead remake	 but as Sherlock Holmes he looks like a scarecrow. Not only does Frewer have a lanky lackadaisical walk that is hard to watch	 but he looks uncomfortable in the stereotypical Holmes overcoats that he is wearing. Not only that	 but while the coat is gray twill they apparently could not find a matching cap. So his cap is black and it looks shiny as if it were made of polyester. Whatever the cap was made of	 it looked very new and artificial. Jeremy Brett occasionally wore those traditional outfits	 but Brett did not have to dress-up like Sherlock Holmes in order to look the part. Frewer on the other hand is painful to watch. Even in the full ""Holmes"" outfit	 he does not carry himself like Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Frewer's cadaverous face grinning all the time as he spouts on and on in a very bad ""Upper-Crust"" British accent is painful to see and listen to. To say that Frewer is overacting is an understatement. After he finishes each sentence with some kind of nasal hum	 he then sneers as if that were some kind of British trait. When I started watching this I thought it might be a comedy featuring Wishbone	 the Jack Russell Terrier. I thought Frewer had been cast as some kind of foil for Wishbone. But sadly	 there is no dog in this movie except for Frewer. Wishbone would have made this movie a lot better.<br /><br />Not only does Frewer's version of Sherlock Holmes never stop talking (in that awfully artificial British nasal accent)	 but he is much to friendly and kind. Frewer is always smiling at the witnesses he talks to	 and he is so polite and courteous that he could be teaching at a Charm School instead of being a Sleuth. Perhaps since this is a Hallmark Channel production	 they are trying to make a children's version of Sherlock Holmes (Wishbone was better at that	 too) that was kindler and gentler. Whatever the point of Frewer's interpretation of Sherlock Holmes	 it is flatter than a pancake	 and easily the worst version of Sherlock Holmes that I have ever seen (including the previous worst	 by Charlton Heston).<br /><br />Overall	 the tone of this film is awful. It reminded me of a typical episode of Barnaby Jones or Murder She Wrote or Diagnosis Murder. All the suspects over-acted suspiciously and glared at the victims before they were killed. Holmes and Watson are explaining every clue to each other during the entire movie. Even on Murder She Wrote there is less exposition.<br /><br />This Sherlock Holmes does not even compare very well to Jim Rockford of the Rockford Files and it is miles below Columbo. The awful dialog is probably the fault of the writer. It is obvious that who ever wrote this script has very little familiarity with Sherlock Holmes	 especially the BBC version with Jeremy Brett. This movie has all of the atmosphere of an episode of Little House on the Prairie. The fact that the actors seem to be smirking when they enunciate their lines in their fake accents does not help.<br /><br />The only minor bright spot is Ken Walsh who plays Doctor Watson with some dignity. Walsh does not ham it up compared to Frewer	 and when he is often interviewing witnesses	 his demeanor and conversational style are much more natural and credible. Unfortunately	 the rest of the cast is amateurish	 and the visual clues they give by glaring and making faces at each other (to show they are suspicious) is something that I had not seen in any modern movie."	0.0
"Nowadays it is sort of a trend to look upon all shows from begin 90's as classics (people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days)	 and while some of those shows were/are undoubtedly good	 this one is just pure crap. I watched this show a lot back in those days since it got A LOT of reruns on TV back then	 and even as a child I didn't like it. Even a 8-year old can see how much the people in Power Rangers are overacting	 and how much the special-FX sucked even back then. When the show doesn't resort to the painfully bad 'fighting'-scenes	 it plagues the viewer with this unnecessary soap-opera about a group of teens and they'r little social problems every now and then. I don't know about you	 but I didn't give a rats ass about any of that at all	 and its basically filler until they have to 'fight' some dude again in a very cliché alien-costume with fireworks or some toy-robot. You never feel 'involved' in some kind of way with this show	 and the fact that most of the actors act like there really have no interest at all besides they'r wallet just enhances the lack of feeling.<br /><br />There is really nothing memorable about this show	 and its pretty surprising that it got so many spin-offs (Beetleborgs is a good example). All it is is just a quick way to make some money though. I challenge any 'fan' to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that is supposed to be so good because I couldn't find anything that is even slightly appealing to children. My guess is that most 'fans' of Power Rangers will tell me that I ""just don't get it"" anyway	 or something along that line. I really don't care though; this was crap back then and it still crap now."	0.0
"If you played ""Spider-Man"" on the PS version	 then you've seen it all. To truly experience it you should get the DC version. Simply put it's a much graphically superior game; the textures are sharp	 levels are easy to navigate	 and it has much better sound then it's PS cousin. I bought this game back in late '00s and it still holds up even till this day. Well	 Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a much superior and strategic game but if you're a fan of 'ol Web Head then you owe it yourself to pick this up for your gaming library. Swinging around the city as Spidey has never looked this good and dead-on in a video game. If you have a Dreamcast	 snag this up for cheap. The DC version is simply incredible."	1.0
"The widower family man Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes the column ""Dan in Real Life"" giving advices for families in The New Jersey Standard and raises his three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Pill)	 the older	 has just got her driving license but Dan does not allow her to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) has a crush on his high-school mate Marty; and the young Lily (Marlene Lawston) misses her mother. When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion	 he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and they spend hours talking to each other. They feel attracted for each other	 but Marie receives a phone call and leaves Dan	 giving her phone number first. Dan immediately falls in love for Marie	 but when he return to his parent's home	 he finds that Marie is the girlfriend of his wolf brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook)	 who is also in love with her. Along the weekend	 the attraction between the clumsy Dan and Marie increases and they have to take a decision.<br /><br />""Dan in Real Life"" is a great surprise and a delightful movie	 with comedy	 romance and drama. The chemistry of the gorgeous Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is awesome and it is very easy to know why everybody loves Marie. The trio Allison Pill	 Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston is fantastic and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments of this story. The screenplay is wonderful and the performances of the talented actors and actresses are stunning	 with a realistic behavior of a family meeting. Follow the advice of Dan's column and plan to be surprised with the reunion of the Burns' family. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Eu	 Meu Irmão e Nossa Namorada"" (""Me	 My Brother and Our Girlfriend"")"	1.0
"I know	 that's not what you expect from a film with this sort of<br /><br />lineage- it's a direct descendant of The Best Years of Our Lives<br /><br />and The Men... films dealing with men who are in the hospital<br /><br />dealing with tragic circumstances. But this film is full of wonderful<br /><br />surprises and performances. It features stellar performances from<br /><br />Eric Stoltz and Helen Hunt (including a rather risque nude scene)<br /><br />and Wesley Snipes and William Forsythe. As Emanuel Levy wrote<br /><br />in his book Cinema of Outsiders (about the Independent film<br /><br />movement) ""The Waterdance is coherant	 attentive to detail	 and<br /><br />unsentimental with a wicked down to earth humor- it' s at once<br /><br />funny and sad	 and the entire cast is impressive."" I was<br /><br />extraordinarily moved by this film	 it's hard hitting yes	 but also has<br /><br />very tender moments and laugh out loud moments. A rare gem."	1.0
"After seeing MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS I am still convinced that the first decent movie about (teenage) witches yet has to be made. I didn't think much of THE CRAFT and I'm not into CHARMED either. The only film I more or less enjoyed (about teenage witches) was LITTLE WITCHES (1996)	 and even that one wasn't very good. But changes are that if you liked all the aforementioned movies	 you will also enjoy MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS.<br /><br />I was expecting a silly and cheesy early 80's movie about teenage witches in high school. But I was rather surprised that this whole movie plays it rather serious. The acting is decent and serious all the time. No jokes are being played by teenagers or something. And the musical score	 at first	 I thought was pretty good. It added some scariness and also something 'classy'	 with the use of threatening violins and all. But as the movie progressed I came to the conclusion that the score was just too ambitious. They didn't have to add those threatening violins when you simply see someone back up a car and then drive away at normal speed.<br /><br />Then there's Melissa Sue Anderson	 who was the main reason for me to see this movie. A few weeks ago	 I saw her in HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME	 a rather enjoyable	 thick-plotted (and goofy on some occasions) slasher-movie which she had done in the same year as MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS. And I must say	 she was very good as the icy-cold bad witch Vivian. But the main problem with the movie is: almost nothing happens! Vivian causes a death and an accident	 yes	 but that's it. Then there's Robin	 the good witch	 who is just learning about her powers. And we expect the two of them using their powers more than once	 but at only one occasion they use their powers to make some pieces of wood and other stuff fly through the air as projectiles. That was supposed to be a fight between two powerful witches? And what's worse	 I was hoping to see a spectacular show-down between the witches at the end of the movie with at least some special effects	 flaming eyes or whatever... but nothing happens. There is sort of a confrontation in the end	 but it's a big disappointment.<br /><br />So	 the acting of the two witches was good. The musical score was decent (even though overly ambitious). And the cinematography was rather dark and moody at times. But that doesn't make a good movie yet	 does it?"	0.0
"This movie is just like every other dutch movie	 so if you enjoy movies such as turks fruit and de kleine blonde dood. then you might be okay with this one (even though those two have much better stories and actors) Zomerhitte starts strong enough	 but even that one good scene ends up having nothing to do with the storyline. There's a lot of nudity (but me and others just could not find that girl attractive)	 the dialog is laughable (as we did a lot to the annoyance of other movie watchers)	 and some of the scenes are so completely random that this is more of an unintentional comedy than anything else (like a random scene in which an owl rips somebody's eye out...it has nothing to do with anything and is only referenced once later in a sentence saying ""did you hear what happened...I was there""). the only reason I gave it a 2 is because some of the places they are at look nice...that's it. And the reason I saw it was because we went to the sneak preview (here in Holland we have a strange system regarding sneak previews	 you pay less money then for a regular movie and you don't know what movie it is that you will be watching. All you know is that it's a new movie that's not yet in the theaters). My advice is to stay far away from this film	 if you really want to see a good dutch movie watch temmink or zwartboek."	0.0

"My 3 year old loved it. I loved it	 my wife loved it. So 10 out of 10 from our family. As for violence level? Not really that violent	 mostly of the slap stick variety. Nobody truly dies	 no gore	 no blood	 no torture	 so it certainly is appropriate for children	 much more so than many Saturday morning cartoons.<br /><br />This movie really takes the idea of CG movies where it should go.<br /><br />First of all beautiful graphics	 textures wonderfully done	 with true depth	 not trying to be realistic	 but forming an artistic whole. The moss on the stones	 the rust on metal	 the reliefs on the wood and the stone	 everything adds to the whole.<br /><br />Character modeling	 unlike many contemporary CG movies	 is quirky	 not cute	 again within an artistic whole. The faces may look less malleable than in some other movies	 but the characters are more puppet-like than human-like. I think that is a good thing	 it lends veracity	 how strangely it may sound	 it is easier to suspend your disbelief.<br /><br />Hair	 fur	 clothing	 on par	 at least with the likes of Pixar. Just note in the opening scenes when Lian-Chu is fighting the giant slug; Gwizdo is in front of some farmers	 and all of them have detailed clothing which caused me to pause the movie just to admire it.<br /><br />The setting. Far beyond the likes of Cars	 and even WallE. Space has been done many times	 but the fantasy environs of Dragon Hunters are only comparable with some scenes in Never Ending Story and Lord of the Rings	 but again it is an artistic whole	 and with lots of good ideas thrown about effortlessly. Magnificent vistas like the scene in Monsters Inc. where they ride all the doorways through its storage facility	 or WallE where we see the immense trash towers he made	 abound in this movie	 everything is grand	 yet never dwelt upon; it is just the background the whole way! The interlude where they walk through the area with the fantastic falls. The Chinese wall	 the islands floating in the sky. The Broccoli in the sky? That is truly where I believe CG should go	 make something which takes your breath away	 and do it again and again.<br /><br />The sound is good	 the music is varied and not only epic	 and thankfully without any vocals	 and purely original for the movie.<br /><br />Animation is quite good. Lending its inspiration to cartoons	 especially some good use of stretch and squeeze. Sometimes not that realistic	 but the 3d models are not realistic either.<br /><br />Characterization is well done too. Lian-Chu the gentle and uncertain giant is gradually growing in confidence basking in the attention of little Zoé.<br /><br />Gwizdo the wily manager of Lian-Chu redeems himself in the end	 while Zoé isn't really changed at all	 but who wants that cute child to change anyway? I at least loved Lian-Chu more than any other recent character since Sulley in Monsters Inc.<br /><br />The internal strife in the group gets ironed out by the external pressures	 just as it should in a proper fantasy story.<br /><br />The story is mostly reminiscent of the Never Ending Story	 especially how the world brakes apart. The monsters are pretty standard fare	 except the flocking one. It lacks the emotional impact of WallE	 which is the really strong point of that movie	 but it is a much more fun ride	 and lacks the annoying musical scene replaying in the former one	 and has action from the first scene. This movie is what you want to watch for a fun and exciting time.<br /><br />The whole movie has	 as I've mentioned a whole vision	 which seems to have been followed rigorously throughout.<br /><br />It seems	 that the setting is ready for more adventures	 and I for one would hope so.<br /><br />One side note	 the French actor doing Lian-Chu sounded a bit like Jean Reno at first	 but I'm happy it wasn't him	 though he is one of my favorites. Nice to hear a new	 to me	 voice.<br /><br />I give it a max rating	 a bit surprised at the mediocre and low ratings by some; I have tried to address some of the concerns made by two of the reviews with the lowest vote. Approach this movie as an adventure	 and as a European movie	 not opposed to Hollywood	 but different."	1.0
"There are just so many things wrong with this movie.<br /><br />To begin with	 the first twenty minutes of the film could have been compressed into just five or maybe ten. The overall movie is (mercifully) short already	 but this could have been made up for by giving a little more attention to the Mean Lion (how did the miss a reference to ""The Wiz"" on that one?) and working his subplot a little more closely into the main plot. In short	 the script had the seed of a good idea	 but needed quite a bit of reworking.<br /><br />Second	 it could have done without the crude humor. The original also had some that it could have done without	 but at least there it was almost an afterthought -- here	 flatulence and urination abound.<br /><br />Third	 the show is a little too self-aware. The original series had that well enough	 as did the first movie	 but here it's just way	 way too much. The Brendan Fraser in-jokes were just a bit over the top (and why no mention of the ""new Ursula""?). Other gags with the Narrator	 especially a couple of interactions near the end	 also exceed good sense.<br /><br />Fourth	 a bit more attention could have been given to the CGI work. In the first it was hard to tell that Shemp wasn't a real elephant (except by behavior	 of course)	 but here the CGI stands out like a sore thumb. Ideally special effects should merely tell the story whether they're good or bad	 and they at least do succeed on that count	 so it's a relatively small problem	 but it's still there.<br /><br />All that said	 Christopher Showerman's performance as George is decent enough. It lacks Brendan Fraser's charm	 but Christopher only really fails in that specific comparison -- he even managed to give George a bit of personal depth	 which should have been a major foul in a Jay Ward-inspired movie but wasn't here. Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me as being even better than Leslie Mann in the original.<br /><br />Most other performances were pretty standard	 not standing out in my mind as either good or bad."	0.0

"I've had a lot of experience with women in Russia	 and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like	 unfortunately. They are very cunning	 ruthless	 and greedy	 as well as highly unfair. From the robotic sex	 the hustling for gifts	 to the lies and betrayal	 I've experienced it all in Russia.<br /><br />I know what I'm talking about. And here are my qualifications: Here are the photojournals of my three trips to Russia in search of a bride. It includes thousands of pics of many hot Russian girls I met	 black comedy	 scams I was privy to	 and the story of my mugging and appearance on Russian national TV.<br /><br />http://www.happierabroad.com/Photojournals.htm<br /><br />It's like Reality TV. You will love it. I spent a ton of time putting it together. So check it out. The Russian woman that Nicole Kidman plays is a lot like the Julia and Katya in my photojournals.<br /><br />My 3 bride seeking trips in Russia happen to be very exciting and would sell	 so why don't they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventures in Russia? However	 there is one factual impossibility in this film	 and that is the way which the guy orders his bride from a catalog and having her arrive at an airport. It doesn't work that way at all	 so I don't understand why the media likes to perpetuate this. There isn't a single Russian bride introduction website that works this way	 and I challenge anyone to find one that does. The fact is	 you can only order the Russian lady's CONTACT INFO (email	 address	 phone number	 etc.) from the website. From there	 you correspond and then visit her	 and if you want to bring her to your country	 you start the immigration process at your INS office	 and wait months after that. That's how it works in real life. You can't just order her to arrive at your airport. US Immigration would NEVER allow such a thing to happen.<br /><br />WuMaster <br /><br />- I got everything I wanted by going abroad! You can too! http://www.happierabroad.com"	1.0
"I have loved this movie all of my life. It's such an intelligent story also	 with plenty of classical allusions. eg. The ship that went missing decades earlier was called the Bellerophon. Well	 in classical mythology this was the man who slew the Chimera	 a legendary beast composed of two or more other creatures. In FP	 Walter Pidgeon is clearly the chimera- himself and his Id monster. <br /><br />I like movies where the writers have clearly credited their audiences with a modicum of intelligence	 unlike most modern blockbusters which spend $150m on special effects	 but about $1.50 on a screenplay.<br /><br />Cheers"	1.0
"Barman directed Any Way the Wind Blows as he would sing a dEUS song. Anarchy rules over a logical and common strain of thoughts. The story behind this movie just goes any which way the wind blows. And that can truly be refreshing to watch	 if you are prepared and willing that is. Viewers who state that there is nothing to keep the story-lines together are right. Who the hell is that Windman anyway? Still	 I really enjoyed this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful	 bustling	 happening place and Any Way captures that feeling. It also captures the silliness	 the racism	 the bureaucracy	 the addictions and the violence that survives undetected in a seemingly friendly city. The movie is entertaining	 funny and a little shallow. Barman's screen debut will not make as heavy an impact as his music debut. In that light some might be disappointed. But then again	 'Worst Case Scenario' would be a subtle subtitle for Any Way the Wind Blows."	1.0
"A Murder investigation goes on back stage while The Vanities	 on its opening night	 plays on to an unknowing audience. Odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth a look for its cast	 its production numbers	 and the sheer novelty of the film.<br /><br />Gertrude Michael has the showy role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show's stars	 Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson	 as well as starring in the infamous ""Sweet Marijuana"" number (which was also on a 70s Bette Midler album). So while the chorus girls shuffle around backstage	 bumbling detective Victor McLaglen ogles the girls while he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman.<br /><br />We quickly learn that the maid (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson from afar	 that the wardrobe lady (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother	 and that the stage manager (Jack Oakie) butts into everything. Lots of plots twists among the musical numbers. The show's best-known song is ""Cocktails for Two."" Kitty Carlisle also sings the haunting ""Where Do They Come From?"" And there's a weird rhapsody that erupts into a Harlem specialty number featuring Duke Ellington! Quite the cast.<br /><br />Some terrific acting here	 especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is quite good as well. Brisson is a total zero though.<br /><br />Charles Middleton plays Homer	 Toby Wing plays Nancy	 Donald Meek plays the doctor	 and also see if you can spot Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the show girls."	1.0
"I think they really let the quality of the DVD production get away from them. I rented this DVD from 2 movie stores and the second time I finally got it to play on the 3rd DVD player I tried.<br /><br />Anyone else have this issue? It's really hard to give the film an un-biased review after going through such a hassle to play it. For one	 I've never seen a Finnish horror film before so I was sort of bummed that the movie was done in English. Also since it's never made clear what is wrong with Sarah	 she just came off as retarded and therefore I really just hoped someone would shoot her in the face and make all the horrific happenings go away."	0.0
"C'mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode. It's just an old 60's TV show ! This episode of Star Trek is notable because of the most serious babe (Yeoman Barrow's) ever used on Star Trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location. Unlike the TNG and Voyager series which were totally confined to sound stages.<br /><br />This use of an outdoor location (and babe) gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show.<br /><br />Except a few notable exceptions i.e ""The city on the edge of forever"" 	 ""assignment Earth"" and ""Tomorrow is Yesterday"" The old series of Star Trek needs to be seriously moth-balled and put out of it's boring misery. Half a dozen good episodes from 79 is quite a poor batting average.<br /><br />This is typical of the boring stuff Gene Roddenberry produced back then actually	 contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on	 he actually made a LOT of rubbish! He doesn't deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as Irwin Allen for example.<br /><br />Just look at the set of the bridge of the Enterprise from a modern point of view. They used wobbly plywood for the floor	 cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels. You can clearly see the folds in the paper !

"Monster is a mind numbingly awful movie about an evil American concrete factory (are there any else in Hollywood?) polluting the waters of the small Colombian town of Chimayo somehow creating a catfish-like beast with a predilection for lamb and loose women. James Mitchum is Bill Travis the man who is sent down to Chimayo by his foul-mouthed boss Barnes who himself can't keep his hands off of his secretary's rear to get to the bottom (pun intended) of the story. While in Chimayo Bill must contend with an annoying reporter who apparently broadcasts all of her stories in perfect English directly back to America. I guess in the seventies there was a market for news from small South American towns. There is also a radical named Sanchez that wishes to sabotage the factory for polluting the water which	 by the way	 also supplies the town with jobs for the locals	 but why let cold hearted economics get in the way of touchy-feely enviro-marxism. Pete the factory boss is unwittingly aided by the monster when he has sex with his ex-girlfriend on the beach	 tells her that he is seeing the mayor's daughter Juanita and it's over between them	 then she is promptly eaten that night. A little side action without the evidence. My hat is off to you Sir. John Carradine rounds out the cast as a priest that believes the monster is sent by God to punish sinners. You can see the contempt he has for being in this movie in his face. Might as well filmed him running to the local currency exchange to see if his check didn't bounce.<br /><br />Supposedly based on a true story	 so much so they say it twice in the opening credits	 this film is awful on all fronts. Filming began in 1971 and was abandoned until eight years later when Kenneth Hartford put his foot on the throat of Monster by adding his two annoying children as new characters	 even putting his daughter	 Andrea in top billing with Mitchum and Carradine. The sound quality is nonexistent and most of the scenes seem as if someone smeared tar over the camera before filming. This is made even more tedious during the many scenes done at night. The monster itself is laughable as it rears its ugly rubbery head for the anticlimactic ending. James Mitchum along with his brother Chris are proof that nepotism in the acting industry needs to be curtailed. Utterly unwatchable dreck. Shame on you John Carradine."	0.0
"The Running Man is often dismissed as being just another Arnie action thriller full of explosions	 bad puns and gunfire	 and to be fair	 there is a lot of that in it. People used to look at it and compare it to the Terminator series	 saying it was one of the poorer Schwarzenegger films.<br /><br />But	 give it 18 years	 and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light. Rather than just being another brainless action film	 it works very well as a parody of reality TV. It is quite different to the Stephen King book	 true	 but I doubt whether Hollywood	 with its love of upbeat endings and so-called 'ordinary guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando	 would have accepted it in its current form.<br /><br />But	 on with the review.<br /><br />Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cop working in a dystopian United States where democracy is a thing of the past	 and the entire country is ruled by a government/media conglomerate amalgamation. The economy is in tatters	 food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch	 like Jumping for Dollars	 where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs	 and the most popular one is The Running Man	 a gameshow hosted by the slimy Damian Killian (played by the entertaining Richard Dawson) where supposed 'criminals' are hunted down by theatrical	 pro-wresting-esquire 'stalkers'.<br /><br />Some	 however	 try and speak up against the government. When a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of Bakersfield	 California	 a helicopter piloted by Richards is sent to 'calm' (i.e. kill) the protest. When Richards refuses to fire on innocent people	 he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd. He is sentenced to a slave labour camp	 but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and goes on the run.<br /><br />However	 his freedom does not last long	 and after he kidnaps network employee Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso) in an attempt to escape those pursuing him	 he finds himself taken prisoner again	 but this time he is forced to appear on The Running Man.<br /><br />And there	 of course	 the entire film kicks into standard Arnie mode. Richards is launched into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Los Angeles (why is LA always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) and forced to run from the 'stalkers'	 along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him. Amber also becomes curious about Richards' protestations of innocence	 and discovers he was framed. Guess what happens to her	 then? So	 as Amber	 Richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers	 we soon become aware that Richards is no ordinary cop. He's Super Arnie	 the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in Christmas lights all while being just your average American guy with an Austrian accent.<br /><br />Yes	 the remainder of the film becomes dumb	 loud	 classic 80's Arnie fun. There's a lot of exciting fight sequences	 the trademark dreadful puns ('He had to split' being my favourite)	 and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending. It's a lot of fun watching Killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome' gameshow host way	 as well	 and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host (watch out for the cursing old lady!) and the cold	 cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratings.<br /><br />If you expect a high-brow	 intelligent film	 you'll be disappointed. But if you want a great 80s flick	 well	 this is it. But the great thing about this film is it was quite prophetic.<br /><br />If you look at the entertainment we have today	 you'll have noticed the way reality TV is going nowadays - shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame	 and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on TV. It's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile TV exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on TV. We've already had that	 however	 with the ghoulish al-Qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet. It seems that in the current climate	 at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television sets.<br /><br />With that in mind	 and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s	 you have to be impressed by the far-sightedness of this film. Of course	 we haven't reached there yet	 as it's terrorists	 rather than the mainstream media	 who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death	 but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity..."	1.0

"A lot of people don't think Branagh's Hamlet film is all that good	 but I must admit I think it is splendid. Like virtually every production of Shakespeare	 it has problems and it has had to make hard choices	 not all of which work out. The thing about the ""secret doors everywhere""	 for instance	 simply doesn't work. That element never achieves the ominous feeling of metaphor or analogy that it attempts to	 which results in the play being too gaudy and losing its trademark sense of a thousand mysteries looming. This is the biggest problem with this production. And while it's a biggie	 I'm also inclined to say that it's the only problem. Almost everything else works out absolutely beautifully. All right	 so Branagh is a mite too old for the title role. And the relationship with Ophelia seems a little forced. And he gets too hysterical at times. But that's it. No other complaints. Even with these faults	 I think this version is a seminal one	 and if it's not as powerful a drama as it ought to be	 it's every bit the literary work that it equally ought to be. We get the complete text of the longest version of the play	 innovatively and expensively brought to the screen	 mostly enunciated in perfect and modern and highly understandable voices - even if they sometimes speak too quickly in order to get the massive text over with. But in a staging of Shakespeare	 it simply is not possible to speak slowly enough for the audience to really appreciate the full depths of the language. For that	 one must delve into the print versions of the plays.<br /><br />All the actors of this version are simply mesmerizing and utterly and instantly classic (incl. Jack Lemmon). Julie Christie as Gertrude is surely one of the best ever	 and even the American actors are astounding	 esp. Charlton Heston as the Player King - who would have thought it?! (A story is going around that Heston once played Hamlet on stage	 and when a critic in the front row couldn't stand his hammy acting and said out loud	 ""This is terrible!""	 Heston reportedly retorted right from the stage: ""Well	 I didn't write this crap!"" Of course it may not be true	 but it's a funny story - and if true	 a bold and ironic choice for Branagh to include Heston here.) Robin Williams as ""Young Ozric"" is perhaps not young enough for the part	 but he makes it a comical one	 which is warranted.<br /><br />Overall it is a very well-produced version	 with most of the key scenes being	 to my mind	 supremely memorable. Of course	 I watched this movie just as I was becoming interested in Shakespeare (and around the same time as Luhrmann's formidable Romeo+Juliet)	 and it made a great impression on me	 which must account for some of my fondness for it.<br /><br />All things considered	 I must pronounce Branagh's Hamlet to be my favorite one	 with Derek Jacobi's 1980 BBC version a close second. I probably like Branagh's Shakespeare work more than most	 finding him an expert interpreter and popularizer	 with an attractively casual attitude to the words and a deep and appropriately and unashamedly enthusiastic appreciation of the text. In the world of Shakespeare acting	 the two brightest luminaries remain Olivier and Branagh	 and while Olivier is the superior actor	 Branagh brings Shakespeare down from the pedestal of snobbery and artifice	 and transforms it into churlish	 easy-going	 populistic worldliness while compromising none of its dignity. Branagh	 I believe	 brings out a truer Shakespeare than the world has yet seen.<br /><br />And so	 10 out of 10 for an absolutely tremendous Hamlet."	1.0
"I stumbled across rerun syndication of this show several years ago	 and fell in love with it. It features Téa Leoni and Holland Taylor and kept me laughing	 one episode after the next. I guess it didn't make it so big	 and was cancelled after a few seasons	 but I believe it was a good run	 and would suggest watching it...if the opportunity arises."	1.0
"From the nepotism capitol of the world comes another junk flick in a fancy wrapper.

"Cradle of Fear<br /><br />This isn't a movie where intricate delicate little narrative nuances occupy our attention. This is not a film where the special effects are supposed to leave us slack-jacked uttering that sense of whoa. What it is though is a slice of lo-fi goth horror which leaves little to the imagination	 created in the eyes of the director	 Alex Chandon	 as ""a throwback to sleazy '70s and '80s horror"".<br /><br />This is a very visceral experience for 2 hours	 where four plot lines are connected through lots of watery blood	 reams of dismembered body parts and innards	 tied by an intestinal thread of revenge. <br /><br />The purveyor of such horrific violence is Dani Filth	 lead-singer of the metal band Cradle of Filth	 executing a role he was destined to play. <br /><br />As other's have said	 there is nothing new about wanting to carryout occultist revenge. In this particular context a convicted sexual predator and murderer	 Kemper	 the father of our devilish avenging-angel	 compels his son to exact retribution on those who are some how connected to convicting him to purgatory within an insane asylum.<br /><br />What this provides for the Chandon	 who should be congratulated on also penning and editing this piece	 is the opportunity to let his sick mind run free. He seems to take delight in the idea of splattering blood into the orifices of those on screen	 and into every nook and cranny that can be reached. We are also treated to close-ups of skull's being crushed	 demonic rape	 and other assorted imagery to engage those who relish getting up close and personal to their horror. And for some of those who closely follow these type of films	 there is the odd sequence which may have you thinking	 ""Did I just see what I thought I did""	 because of course Pretty Woman this 'aint. It reminds me of some of the gore-fests created out of Italian horror some 20 to 30 years ago	 and a number of other works where disgusting images have left their mark but not the context in which they were viewed.<br /><br />Story 4 of the set is particularly intriguing where the idea of ones obsession can ultimately lead to death in the pursuit of internet violence through the ""Sick Room""	 where the user is in control of how a life can be snuffed out. Further acknowledgements should also go out to a pounding soundtrack that allows Filth to exercise his daytime talent	 and an effective use of drum and bass	 often overlooked in film-making as a viable form of supporting visuals. Using the city of London as a backdrop with real people as opposed to movie stand-ins also adds support to the commando feel of the film. OK	 classic it may not be	 but blood	 guts	 intestines	 occult and demons in a slightly perverse unproblematic way it is."	0.0
"So we compromised. This was a fairly charming film	 I liked the art direction (it felt far more ""real"" than most kids movies)	 and the costumes weren't too cutesy. The child actors were not bad to watch (the adult performances trended toward cheesy). It was great that they showed how a bullied kid bullies others as well as kids standing up to bullying.<br /><br />I don't know how many grown ups would want to see this for themselves	 but it's a great film to take a kid to. And since ""Barnyard"" was apparently attended by 100+ kids at the same time	 I'm REALLY glad we picked the sparsely attended showing of ""worms"" instead."	1.0
"Things to Come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress. It makes some surprising accurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later	 but is woefully naive in it's Utopian ideals.<br /><br />Raymond Massey	 Cedric Hardwicke	 and Ralph Richardson make up a fine cast	 although the drama is played more as a stage piece	 than a work of cinema. There are grandiose	 if somewhat stilted speeches	 often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater. However	 there are some profound words there. Is technology the savior of mankind	 or the instrument of its destruction? The film is a visual feast	 if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects. Sure	 Hollywood is more sophisticated today	 but rarely as inventive. For the imaginative	 the third act is a treat: a world with underground cities	 massive deco bombers	 space cannons	 gyro copters	 and secret organizations of scientist saviors. It has all of the makings of a sci-fi pulp adventure	 but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise.<br /><br />Things to Come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic Hollywood science fiction cinema. They are operatic in scope	 and visually inspiring. Technology has long left them behind	 but their ideas still burst forth. There is an artistry there	 one with more heart and emotion than the computer generated mass-produced cinema of today. These films are the products of artisans	 not industrialists."	1.0
"supposedly based on the life of Domino Harvey a model turned bounty hunter. I'd say 95 % is fabricated. I always keep an open mind when it comes to movies	 however	 this movie lost its chances when it became apparent it had narration throughout the film	 something i can't stand	 and to top it off	 the heroine of the story is so hateful and depicted as an arrogant b!ch I just wanted it to end with her being shot in the head. it's too incoherent	 too flashy and way too boring	 it's a who gives a crap kinda story	 and i really think that big time directors need to make movies based on their own or a writer's own imagination not something based on some ignorant snobby brat's life."	0.0
"A splendid example of how Hollywood could (and still can) take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it up.<br /><br />In the case of ""the Big Sky	"" writer Dudley Nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the Pulitzer prize-winning author	 A.B. Guthrie. In so doing	 they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptation.<br /><br />The epic nature of Guthrie's book and the evolution of its main character	 Boone Caudill	 from a naive	 Kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivor/mountain man	 has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the author's intent. In the movie version	 Boone's presence is nothing except underwhelming.<br /><br />Intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give Guthrie's novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever. Most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the Zeb Calloway character	 who was an incidental	 minor character in the book	 only occupying a handful of pages. On the other hand	 a very important and fascinating character	 Dick Summers	 the veteran pioneer	 is missing altogether!!! It is also apparent that director Hawks decided the Zeb character in the movie	 played by actor Hunnicutt	 wasn't irritating enough. So Zeb/Hunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious	 voice-over narration that is the Hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing	 editing	 and direction.<br /><br />Some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based (William Wyler's ""Ben-Hur"" is an excellent example). But this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itself.<br /><br />The story is dull and clichéd	 and the characters - at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script - are just shallow and boring shadows of Guthrie's literary vision. And unfortunately	 Kirk Douglas' star appeal	 which could have helped lift this film	 was scuttled by the milktoast role he was given.<br /><br />If you can believe it	 the film version of Guthrie's Pulitzer prize-winning sequel	 ""The Way West	"" also starring Kirk	 is even worse.<br /><br />In my opinion	 ""The Big Sky"" further solidifies Howard Hawks' place as one of the most overrated	 tepid directors in the history of cinema."	0.0
"Here's a decent mid-70's horror flick about a gate of Hell in NYC that just happens to be an old brownstone. Seems like there's lots of gates of Hell around	 but of course this unwitting model happens to decide she needs some space from her boyfriend/fiancée and so she just happens to pick one	 which is disguised as a nice and reasonably priced apartment. She meets several strange neighbors	 and even attends a birthday party for a cat. Upon meeting with the Realtor because she hears strange noises at night from upstairs	 she finds out that she and an old priest are SUPPOSED to be the only tenants. Whoa! Then who are all these weirdos? Her boyfriend (a slimy lawyer	 played by Chris Sarandon) starts poking around and finds that things are not what they seem	 not by a long shot. This has some decent creepy scenes and the idea of the creaky old folks that are her ""sometimes"" neighbors being other than what they appear is fairly intriguing. A bit of decent gore and even a parade of less-than-normal folks towards the end make this a decent watch	 and while I've seen this many times on TV the uncut DVD version is much better	 of course. Not a bad little horror flick	 maybe a good companion piece to ""Burnt Offerings"". 8 out of 10."	1.0

"First of all	 let's get a few things straight here: a) I AM an anime fan- always has been as a matter of fact (I used to watch Speed Racer all the time in Preschool). b) I DO like several B-Movies because they're hilarious. c) I like the Godzilla movies- a lot.<br /><br />Moving on	 when the movie first comes on	 it seems like it's going to be your usual B-movie	 down to the crappy FX	 but all a sudden- BOOM! the anime comes on! This is when the movie goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY downhill.<br /><br />The animation is VERY bad & cheap	 even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER	 for crissakes! In fact	 it's so cheap	 one of the few scenes from the movie I ""vividly"" remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school... & it's the same kids over & over again! The FX are terrible	 too; the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition	 the transition to live action to animation is unorganized	 the dialogue & voices(especially the English dub that I viewed) was horrid & I was begging my dad to take the tape out of the DVD/ VHS player; The only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes & comments like the robots & Joel/Mike on MST3K (you pick the season). Honestly	 this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie & survive it at the same time.<br /><br />Heck	 I'm planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on Halloween for a B-Movie night. Because it's stupid	 pretty painful to watch & unintentionally hilarious at the same time	 I'm giving this movie a 3/10	 an improvement from the 0.5/10 I was originally going to give it.<br /><br />(According to my grading scale: 3/10 means Pretty much both boring & bad. As fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it	 then it will become as fun as counting to 15.)"	0.0
"This movie is simply far too long	 far too repetitive	 with the male nudity and sexuality being (as this is said as a gay with my own collection of adult titles) far too gratuitous and unnecessary. Much of the first third of the movie could have been cut down to ten minutes and been equally as effective without trying the patience (and stamina) of an audience.<br /><br />I saw this movie on an early Saturday afternoon	 with a film festival audience; the type of crowd that tends to be more adventuresome	 interested in more experimental or atypical films	 such as one without much dialog	 shorts	 foreign films. The near sell out crowd in an approximate 275 seat theater started to dribble out within the first half of the movie and while the great majority did stay for the ""pay off"" (which never actually arrived)	 I have never	 in about 14 years of attending any number of film festivals	 experimental	 gay and otherwise	 seen such a large number of people walk away from a film. <br /><br />This movie could easily have been cut down by more than half and been as effective as it was. It also could have gone in different directions	 still with a shorter running time	 and been far more effective.<br /><br />As it currently exists	 this is not something that one can readily recommend or one I would have any desire to watch again."	0.0

"A real head scratcher of a film by Bill Rebane who appeared to be getting worse in his trade throughout the eighties. Three crackpot millionaires invite nine people to a remote hotel to compete in a last person standing contest in which the final contestant will be given $1 million provided he or she makes it that far. A series of lame pranks are pulled on some of the guests while the others engage in what most adults would do under the circumstances namely get shatfaced at the hotel bar. Most scenes are merely an excuse to focus the camera on various female body parts including an opening dance number that is a crossover of American Bandstand meets geriatric aerobics complete with hookers. If there was any hesitation that white people can't dance this scene hammers the final nail in that coffin. Pay close attention for the nipple slip. This continues on for about forty-five minutes until Bill Rebane begins throwing darts at various plot twists and whatever he hits becomes the inspiration for the next scene making this one incoherent mess. It's a game until it's not a game. The three old coots are in complete control until they're not. The hotel is possessed by a supernatural force until it becomes just props. They're dead until they're not. Even the narrator at the end replies that he doesn't know what the hell happened. I defy anyone to reason where Rebane was going on this one. The acting is dinner theater caliber minus the dinner. Most of the actors probably went back to their day jobs at the local Stuckey's. I give it a few points for the scene where the yuppie broad opens the closet and a skeleton is inside skull humping himself. Let's see Gone With the Wind do that! This Chilling Classics collection is really becoming the bane of me. Bane	 Get it! Like Rebane! I hate myself."	0.0

I've never seen another Indian movie that comes close to it	 and few from any country rival its perfection."	1.0
"This is a typical Steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds. I wouldn't call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a Steele novel knows how they ALL end. If you don't want to know much about the plot	 don't keep reading.<br /><br />Gilbert's character	 Ophelia	 is a woman of French decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she	 otherwise a good actress	 cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent. Brad Johnson	 also an excellent actor	 is Matt	 who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce. He is gentle	 convincing and compelling in this role.<br /><br />The two meet on the beach through her daughter	 Pip	 and initially	 Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid. All of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love.<br /><br />The chemistry between the two leads is not great	 even though the talent of these two people is not	 in my opinion	 a question. They did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical. Two people meet	 tragedy	 bigger tragedy	 a secret is revealed	 another tragedy	 and then they get together. I wish there was more to it than that	 but there it is in a nutshell.<br /><br />I wanted mindless entertainment	 and I got it with this. In regard to the genre of romantic films	 this one fails to be memorable. ""A Secret Affair"" with Janine Turner is far superior (not a Steele book)	 as are some of Steele's earlier books turned into film."	0.0

How wonderful	 then	 when I discovered in ""Fever Pitch"" that I really like Miss Barrymore; and Jimmy Fallon; and the Red Sox; and Boston! This film is probably best characterized as a sweet	 light comedy. To be absolutely stereotypical	 the girls will like the movie for its romantic charm and Jimmy Fallon's vulnerability	 and the boys will like it for all the male bonding and the depiction of sports mania.<br /><br />My sports-hating wife	 my teenage daughter	 and I all found something to like in the film.

"How The Grinch Stole Christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing. Now	 eight viewings later	 it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time I saw it.<br /><br />Screenwriters Jeffery Price & Peter S. Seaman of Who Framed Roger Rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of The Grinch to the screen. Ron Howard's direction brought the story to full life	 and Jim Carrey's typically energetic performance as The Grinch steals the show.<br /><br />Some detractors of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story. Having read the original story	 I must say I cannot agree. The movie makes the very same point about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story. Indeed	 it enhances the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why The Grinch became what he was.<br /><br />*MILD SPOILERS* (They probably wouldn't ruin the movie for you... but if you haven't seen it yet and you're one of those who wants to know NOTHING about a story until you've seen it	 you should skip the next two paragraphs.)<br /><br />I think just about everyone can relate to The Grinch's terrible experiences in school. I think all of us	 at one time or another	 were the unpopular one in school who was always picked on. I know I was... and that's why I personally had so much sympathy for The Grinch and what he went through.<br /><br />And Cindy Lou Who's naive idealism	 believing that nobody can be all bad	 was heart rending. When everyone else had turned their backs on The Grinch out of fear and ignorance	 Cindy Lou was determined to be his friend. If only everyone could have such an attitude.<br /><br />In fact	 I think the only thing that might've made the film a little better would have been to further tone down the adult humor and content. It was already pretty restrained	 but any of this adult humor (like when The Grinch slammed nose first into Martha May Whovier's cleavage) just doesn't fit in a story like this.<br /><br />This one's well on its way to being a Christmas classic	 taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the Chuck Jones cartoon as a must-see of every Christmas season."	1.0
"Frustrated middle-aged Deputy District Attorney George Maxwell (a fine performance by George E. Carey	 who also produced this picture) can't stand his naggy	 frigid wife Edith (a perfectly bitchy Anne Bellamy) anymore. Worse yet	 poor George is further saddled with a newborn baby sun and a lascivious lesbian teenage daughter (dishy brunette Sheri Jackson). George has an adulterous fling with lovely	 enticing and free-spirited swinging hippie babysitter Candy Wilson (delightfully played with sexy aplomb by yummy blonde knockout Patricia Wymer). Complications ensue when George finds himself being blackmailed by the bitter Julia Freeman (a nicely venomous turn by Kathy Williams)	 who wants George to spring her psychotic biker boyfriend Laurence Mackey (a frightening Robert Tessier	 who sports a head full of hair here) from jail. Director Tom Laughlin (yep	 the same dude who portrayed Billy Jack!) and screenwriter James McLarty cram the splendidly seamy story with a winning and highly entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity	 sizzling soft-core sex	 and raw violence. Moreover	 they accurately peg the whole wild'n'easy uninhibited sensibility of the 60's youth culture and relate the plot in a tight 75 minute running time	 thus ensuring that this movie doesn't overstay its welcome. One definite highlight occurs when Candy invites her groovy friends over the Maxwells house for an impromptu basement bash complete with pot smoking	 wailing rock music	 and	 of course	 hot naked dancing chicks. Robert O. Ragland's funky score hits the gnarly spot. Stanton Fox's stark black and white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the deliriously sleazy goings-on. Best of all	 this flick rates as a marvelous showcase for the utterly charming and fresh-faced pixie Patricia Wymer	 who positively lights up the screen with her sweet	 bubbly personality and captivating beauty. A total trashy treat."	1.0
"A neat 'race against time' premise - A murdered John Doe is found to have pneumonic plague	 so while the health authority and NOPD battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts	 the murderers think the heat is because the victim's infected cousin is holding out on them. <br /><br />This movie is freely available from the Internet Archive and it's well worth downloading. A lot (all?) of this movie was filmed in genuine New Orleans locations	 which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail	 though to me it does look under-exposed	 even for noir - maybe mobile lighting rigs then weren't what they are. There is also a plenty of location background noise	 which is slightly distracting - car horns in the love scene	 anyone? There are a lot of non-professional supporting artists in crowd scenes	 and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with - not much chance for retakes or recasting	 though the final chase is worth hanging on for. There's not much wrong with the lead actors either: Jack Palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic	 intelligent psychopath - the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific	 while Widmark	 as he often did	 pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level - most of the time. <br /><br />Somebody should remake this - no supernaturals	 no mysticism	 no special FX	 just a good yarn full of character conflict	 and a topical theme. Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole	 and that's spot on with the number of oddball New Orleans types peppering this dark	 sleazy	 against-the-clock drama. There's even a midget newspaper seller.<br /><br />""Community? What community? D'you think you're living in the Middle Ages?"""	1.0

"And it's not because since her days on ""Clarissa Explains It All"" that I've had a bit of a crush on Melissa Joan Hart	 who at the time this show was popular was already well into her 20s	 but was still able to get teenage roles.

"You can tell a Lew Grade production a mile off  distinctly British in style; epic in conception; peopled by international all-star casts; usually set in exotic climes. It's a formula that Grade and his company ITC employed throughout the 70s into the early 80s	 resulting in titles like The Eagle Has Landed	 Firepower	 and Raise The Titanic! In 1977 Grade produced March Or Die	 a remarkably old-fashioned Foreign Legion adventure that models all the characteristics mentioned above. Directed by the usually dependable Dick Richards  who helmed the acclaimed Farewell My Lovely just a couple years earlier - March Or Die is an unfortunate disappointment.<br /><br />A company of Foreign Legionnaires led by the harsh disciplinarian General Foster (Gene Hackman) is sent to Morocco shortly after World War 1. Their mission is to protect an archaeological party fronted by the dedicated Francois Marneau (Max Von Sydow). The archaeologists are carrying out an excavation at the ancient city of Erfoud	 but fear an attack from Arab tribesmen following the decimation of an earlier archaeological group. Foster is not happy with the assignment  he does not consider historical artifacts worthy of his men risking their lives. This creates ongoing tension between himself and Marneau	 who believes that the legionnaires should sacrifice their lives to make the excavation possible. The problems heighten when a beautiful woman named Simone Picard (Catherine Deneuve) tags along with the legionnaires. She is hoping to find out what happened to her father	 a historian abducted by the Arabs when they wiped out the first archaeological team. Her presence arouses desires amongst the legionnaires	 none more so than gypsy thief Marco Segrain (Terence Hill)	 a charming and courageous rogue who initially shows indifference towards his legionnaire colleagues but gradually grows in stature. Things climax with a huge battle at Erfoud	 with swarms of united Arab tribes charging against the handful of legionnaires as they desperately try to defend their lives.<br /><br />On paper the star duo of Gene Hackman and Terence Hill seem a mismatch  Hackman is the heavyweight Oscar-winning character actor	 Hill the handsome but limited Italian heart-throb from numerous low budget spaghetti westerns. One expects Hackman to act his counterpart off the screen. Yet	 bizarrely	 it is Hackman who gives the weak and uninvolving performance	 while Hill raises his game to surprisingly high levels. The film is attractively shot on desert locations	 but the pacing is awfully slow and few of the characters are worth caring for. Maurice Jarre's music is uncommonly flat too  very disappointing from the guy who gave us the Lawrence Of Arabia score. It is remarkable that anyone had the nerve to try an old-fashioned adventure of this type in the 70s (it was a genre that peaked in the 30s	 and had been all but forgotten during the intervening decades). Sadly	 the gamble doesn't really pay off  this homage to the legionnaire flicks of old becomes more of a plod than a march."	0.0
"Positively awful George Sanders vehicle where he goes from being a thief to police czar.<br /><br />While Sanders was an excellent character actor	 he was certainly no leading man and this film proves it.<br /><br />It is absolutely beyond stupidity. Gene Lockhart did provide some comic relief until a moment of anger led him to fire his gun with tragedy resulting.<br /><br />Sadly	 George Sanders and co-star Carol Landis committed suicide in real life. After making a film as deplorable as this	 it is not shocking.<br /><br />The usual appealing Signe Hasso is really nothing here."	0.0
"Having watched this film strictly on the strength of reviewers' ratings I was most pleasantly surprised. Although clearly low-budget	 it bears the signs of clever ingenuity. For example	 when Julia wakes in the strange house and looks out the window I found myself thinking that her sense of isolation would be enhanced with an exterior shot focused on her face and then moving backwards to include the house and its isolated location. And lo and behold! the next scene was exactly that last shot of the house standing lonely on the cliff at the water's edge. There are other examples of how a clever director can elevate his film to the level of a very enjoyable thriller. Savvy viewers will surely spot them but should rest assured they will not be disappointed.<br /><br />As to the performances	 George Macready is his usual creepy self	 barely maintaining his composure while suggesting a capacity for unadulterated violence. Nina Foch was surprisingly good as the no-nonsense working girl who's not about to submit without a fight. But Dame May Witty	 oh boy	 she even had me doubting my own eyes and believing she could get away with her evil schemes.<br /><br />This a real diamond in the rough and not to be missed."	1.0
"This is almost certainly the worst Western I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family/friends have been murdered	 so hero sets out to exact revenge	 foils the ineffective lawman	 rescues the kidnapped loving damsel	 and murders the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldn't be a formula -- but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you'll ever see. The scripting is atrociously simple-minded and insulting; it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth	 maturity	 and realism. The sound is bad; it sometimes looks dubbed. The cinematography is lame	 and the sets are sometimes just facades. The acting is pitiful; sure	 some of the performers could blame the script	 but others cannot use that excuse. I hope I never see Chris Lybbert in a speaking role ever again; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean	 he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho. And speaking of Chris Lybbert	 who plays Hopalong	 check out his duds (if you dare to watch this film): He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard-working	 down-and-dirty cowboy. If you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy	 then get this	 but if you have more than two neurons	 watch something else."	0.0
"Avoid this crap at all costs. Bad script	 bad directing	 bad acting	 bad editing	 bad sound	 and bad music. Get the idea? This movie tries to be western flavored	 it's not. It tries to be hard core violent	 it's not. It tries to present a fresh look at an old genre	 it doesn't. The actors try there best	 and my heart goes out to them. But with such inane material to work with it's hard to make something shine. To me this has all of the looks of a ""fresh outta film school gonna set the world on fire"" first attempt. Freshmen film makers often bite off more that they	 or their budget	 can chew. The best thing they can do is to take a few steps back	 reassess what is possible	 and work within their limited budget the next time out."	0.0
"I saw this film at its New York's High Falls Film Festival screening as well and I must say that I found it a complete and awful bore. Although it was funny in some places	 the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden	 especially the ""Lovely Lady"" and the voice of the narrator (whom I have never heard of) had a lot to be desired. J.C.Mac was	 I felt	 the redeeming feature of this film	 true action and grit and (out of the cast) the only real acting. I am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing	 this could have been a half decent film. Let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release	 or if you really want a copy	 look in the bargain bin in Lidl."	0.0

"Saw a screener of this before last year's Award season	 didn't really know why they gave them out after the voting had ended	 but whatever	 maybe for exposure	 at the least	 but the movie was a convoluted mess. Sure	 some parts were funny in a black humor kind of way	 but none of the characters felt very real to me at all. There was not one person that I could connect with	 and I think that is where it failed for me. Sure	 the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive towards Scientology	 WOW! What a grand idea...let's see if that already hasn't been mined to the point of futility. The whole ordeal feels fake	 from the lighting	 the casting	 the screenplay to the horrible visual effects(which is supposed to be intentional	 I can tell	 and so can everyone else	 no one is laughing with you though). Anyways	 I hope it makes it out for sale on DVD at least	 I wouldn't want a project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort into get completely unnoticed. But it's tripe either way. Boring tripe at that."	0.0
"I really didn't like this film. The plot was very predictable. Typical American plot	 I'm sorry. Guy gets the girl kind of thing at the end. And London has a Monorail? Bank of London??? Bank of England is what it really is!! - I did however like the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves. And the Brits were baddies? (apart from Parker and Lady Penelope) What was up with that? Oh and they kept on saying stuff like ""Here come 'The Thunderbirds'"" - but it was never known as 'The Thunderbirds' in the series	 why do that?? I'd like to see this re-made in 20 years with more British cast. I preferred the original series. Sorry!"	0.0
"Fans of goremeister Herschell Gordon Lewis should look elsewhere if they are picking up this film for his usual buckets of blood being sloshed about	 for there is precious little in the way of bloodletting in this film. Instead	 Lewis decides to try and tell the bizarre story	 relying on bargain-basement special effects on a budget which could have probably been doubled if the cast had turned out their pockets for change one day. Oddly enough	 while cheap and very poorly acted (especially by McCabe as Mitchell)	 the total outlandishness of the plot keeps attention throughout. Imagine what this film could have been like with a decent budget! Overall	 it strains for champagne tastes on a beer budget."	0.0
"This movie offers NOTHING to anyone. It doesn't succeed on ANY level. The acting is horrible	 dull long-winded dribble. They obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for. Complete garbage	 I can't believe what a laughable movie this was. <br /><br />And I'm very sure Rosario Dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit	 a wowing NC-17 movie. The problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the OC or something aimed at teens. Pathetic."	0.0
"""Secret of the Lens"" is perhaps a pretty campy all-time favorite of mine. The best and funniest from Kajawari Yoshiaki	 who is known for splatter anime and sleazy hentai-ecchi anime. I wish he did more campiness like this.<br /><br />My favorite scenes are the psychedelic CG sequence	 the parts where Lord Helumis blows up his failing henchmen	 the party riots that Bill causes (one of the funniest scenes) and whenever my favorite character	 Worsle appears.<br /><br />Check this out.<br /><br />WARNING:This is not for serious sophisticated Anime fans!"	1.0
"I missed this movie in the cinema but had some idea in the back of my head that it was worth a look	 so when I saw it on the shelves in DVD I thought ""time to watch it"". Big mistake!<br /><br />A long list of stars cannot save this turkey	 surely one of the worst movies ever. An incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented. Perhaps it would have made more sense if I'd read Robbins' novel but unless the film is completely different to the novel	 and with Robbins assisting in the screenplay I doubt it	 the novel would have to be an excruciating read as well.<br /><br />I hope the actors were well paid as they looked embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and more lately DVD blanks	 take for example Pat Morita. Even Thurman has the grace to look uncomfortable at times.<br /><br />Save yourself around 98 minutes of your life for something more worthwhile	 like trimming your toenails or sorting out your sock drawer. Even when you see it in the ""under $5"" throw-away bin at your local store	 resist the urge!"	0.0
"It's true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes. And none more so that September 11	 2001	 a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism.<br /><br />No	 this documentary didn't set out to be dwelling on the events leading to 9/11. Rather	 the filmmakers	 brothers Gédéon and Jules Naudet	 set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie New York firefighter. They had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training	 and had handpicked their ""proby"" (probation firefighter) to join them in an NY firehouse	 home to Ladder 1 and Engine 7. But their production was to develop and contain at that time	 believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the World Trace Center.<br /><br />I was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of LAN gaming	 and received a call at about 850pm local time from my Dad	 who informed me of the above. Few minutes later	 he told me there was another	 and that the WTC was under attack. By the time I arrived home	 the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke	 and to my horror	 they collapsed	 under an hour.<br /><br />The filmmakers had two cameras running that day	 one who had followed a team out on a routine call	 and which immediately raced to the WTC upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it. We follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of WTC1 where the first responders of firefighters	 paramedics	 and police had to make sense of what happened	 and to quickly develop a plan of action. The other camera	 held by the other brother	 was making his way to WTC to look for his sibling	 and along the journey	 captured the many expressions of New Yorkers	 as well as the sense of chaos in and around Manhatten.<br /><br />Peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from Ladder 1 and Engine 7	 which miraculously	 did not suffer any casualty. But being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil	 as they struggle to come to terms with the event. Through the events that unfold	 we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs	 to save lives.<br /><br />We began with what the documentary was supposed to be	 before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus	 right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures. It's not a film that is fabricated	 and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary (and heavens	 not sound stages for Hollywood blockbusters). It's as close as you can get to that day	 witnessing the event up close	 from safety.<br /><br />Code 1 DVD contains a separate extra hour of 4 sets of interviews with the men of Ladder 1 and Engine 7."	1.0
"Tony Scott has never been a very good director	 but every film he's made after ""Crimson Tide"" seems to bring him one step closer to being the inarguable worst working today (Michael Bay may fall into the same category	 but at least his big	 dumb	 delusional epics entertain on some primally perverse level). And like other overblown Hollywood biopics (""De-Lovely"" and ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind	"" for instance) chronicling the lives of pretentious	 overrated	 or outright shallow ciphers given an aura of ""mystique"" by a society that thrives on the juicy behind-the-scenes details	 ""Domino"" is a film that begins with little potential	 and dashes that infinitesimal amount before the sixty-minute mark. With an already-distended running time of 128 minutes	 the film feels twice as long	 and spending time with characters this obnoxiously superficial and forgettable (unlike the superior ""Rules of Attraction	"" Scott's attempts to tinge the proceedings with irony via Domino's smug	 self-aware-rich-girl voice-over only draws attention to the film's sledgehammer cluelessness) becomes an act only masochists could find pleasurable. The story? Spoiled-upper-crust-babe Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley	 in an ersatz-badass performance as shallow as her gorgeous looks) is sick of the shallow lifestyles of the rich and famous in Los Angeles	 and accosts gruff bounty hunters Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez to learn a more exciting trade; along the way	 there are double-crosses	 shootouts	 media attention (courtesy of a tongue-in-cheek Christopher Walken	 phoning in his trademark sleazebag)	 and laughable hints at romance. Scott cuts the film together in segments that rarely last more than a few seconds	 cranking up the resolution to make the film a neon-drenched nightmare that's frankly unpleasant to watch--if Scott's given an opportunity to shakily frame an image	 ghost it	 or distort it in some way	 he will; but all this tacky stylistic overload overwhelms what little plot	 characterization	 and suspense the film has (to say nothing for its	 ehm	 ""entertainment"" value). Most of the characters come off as either contemptible or stereotypical	 oftentimes both (observe the unbearable	 several-minute segment where an African-American introduces a new list of racial categorizations on ""Jerry Springer"")	 and I found myself wishing they would all get the ""tails"" end of our protagonist's coin by the end. ""Domino"" is utter	 unmitigated trash--whatever interest in this individual Scott hoped to inspire in his audience	 it is lost in a sea of migraine-inducing neon pretension a few minutes in."	0.0
"I've seen a lot of Seagal movies	 and while most aren't great	 or even good	 this steamy pile lowered the bar for bad movies.<br /><br />The plot: not sure really.

Most of the movie is cut scenes going back and forth between people in darkly lit rooms complaining about how good Seagals character ""Mashall"" is.<br /><br />Acting: Blows.<br /><br />Voice Dubbing 						 What was with the horrible voice overdubbing?!

"The only scary thing about this movie is the thought that whoever made it might make a sequel.<br /><br />From start to finish ""The Tooth Fairy"" was just downright terrible. It seemed like a badly-acted children's movie which got confused	 with a ""Wizard of Oz"" witch melting and happy kiddies ending combined with some bad gore effects and swearing.<br /><br />Half of the cast seem completely unnecessary except for conveniently being there to get murdered in some fashion. The sister of the two brothers	 Cherise the aura reader and Mrs. McDonald have entirely no point in the film - they could have included them in the main plot for some interesting side stories but apparently couldn't be bothered. The people watching the film know the characters are there for some bloody death scene but come on	 at least TRY and have a slight plot for them. The story in general is weak with erratic behavior from the characters that makes you wish they all get eaten by the witch.<br /><br />Add the weak plot and the weak acting together (the children are particularly wooden) and the movie ends up a complete failure.

"I've said this in other reviews	 without a story	 you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want	 still no one will give a damn.<br /><br />The director seems to have a great eye for 30s art deco (which I love)	 and I think the idea of using all digital backgrounds and such could indeed be the wave of the future in movie making. However	 it's obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie	 he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinned-plotted film. (SPOILER) For crying out loud	 they forgot to have a villain in this thing! OK they have one	 but he's been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place. Conran misses the point of HAVING a villain. As far as action goes	 well let's see	 Sky Captain (Law) shoots down ONE robot	 two or three of the flapping wing airplanes (before Dex (Ribisi) tells him to stop shooting them down!!!)	 and a couple robots	 but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him. Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or Punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie (the reviewer who comments on hers and Law's lack of chemistry is so right) and I for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera	 showing she ONLY HAS TWO SHOTS LEFT	 both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie	 one uncomically	 one quite funny	 although I saw it coming from 70 years away. No one except Law and Paltrow have any significant time on screen	 and that's the movie's real flaw. An audience doesn't identify with robots	 they need a hero to root for	 and a visible	 despicable villain to hate. Without that	 plus a good engaging story	 all the CG in the world won't help."	0.0
"Loved the movie. I even liked most of the actors in it. But	 for me Ms. Davis' very poor attempt at an accent	 and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch. Seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as Ms. Davis they would be laughed off the screen.<br /><br />I really think she 'phoned this one in'. Now if it had Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman playing the part of the wife I would have enjoyed it much more.<br /><br />I guess I just don't 'get' Bette Davis. I've always thought of her as an actor that 'plays herself' no matter what role she's in. The possible exception is Now Voyager.<br /><br />I'm sure many of the other reviewers will explain in careful (and I hope civil) detail how I am totally wrong on this. But	 I'll continue to watch the movies she's in because I like the stories/writing/supporting casts	 but	 I'll always be thinking	 of different actresses that could have done a better job."	1.0
"I loved this film! I'm a true Tom Hanks fan	 and I have always been impressed with all of his work. From his most dramatic roles like Cast Away	 The Green Mile	 Saving Private Ryan	 Forrest Gump	 Apollo 13 & Philadelphia. To his hilarious roles like A League of Their Own	 Turner and Hooch	 Catch Me If You Can	 The Lady Killers	 Big & of course Toy Story. But in this film Hanks isn't the only great actor who lights up the screen. Tyler Hoechlin	 an up and coming star who shows great promise in Hollywood co stars as Hanks son and delivers nothing short of a great performance. He is certainly someone to watch out for over his career	 I believe he will do great things. Paul Newman as always delivers a brilliant performance on screen. He is truly a legend. We can't forget the people who didn't have such big roles in the film	 but still helped make it great. The beautiful & very talented Jennifer Jason Leigh	 who's performance in Bastard Out of Carolina & Single White Female I will never forget	 brings her grace to the screen as Hank's wife in the film and does a superb job. Liam Aiken is another found treasure in film. He does such a great job with such a small role	 and like his roles in Lemony Snickets	 and Sweet November	 and I Dreamed Of Africa he gives a great performance."	1.0
"This movie is just so awful. So bad that I can't bear to expend anything other than just a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs	 it is terrible.<br /><br />None of the details of the crimes are re-enacted correctly. Lots of slaughterhouse footage. Weird cuts and edits. No continuity to the plot. The acting is absolutely the most amateur I have ever seen.<br /><br />This bomb of a movie was obviously made to make some money without any regard to the accuracy of it's content. The camera work is out of focus at times and always shaky. It looks as if it was shot on video.<br /><br />In fact	 now that they've got Dennis Rader with life in prison	 I wish they would put the guys that made this horrible movie into prison as well.<br /><br />Seriously	 don't even think about watching this one.

"Anyone who is a sucker for 1920s jazz	 1920s dress	 the Charleston	 and ultra-swanky yachts (e.g. me	 on all counts) will want to like this movie. But the sad fact is that that's all there is.

"I had the ""privilege"" of attending a special screening of 'The Absence of Light' at a horror convention in Ohio.<br /><br />First off	 you know you're in trouble when the director introduces a film	 saying: ""Now keep in mind	 we didn't have much money..."" Not that no-budget films are bad	 but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse	 the results are always poor. And there is no better example than this unwatchable sleep-fest. <br /><br />Actually	 'Absence of Light' marks a first in the world of underground cinema: It's the only time I've seen a dream-cast of talented genre vets actually bore me. Charismatic actors like David Hess	 Tony Todd and Reggie Banister randomly enter and exit the movie and prove to be every bit as uninteresting as the amateurish no-names. Who are their characters? What are they talking about? Who cares? It's all so dull	 you'll cease to care about anything or anyone.<br /><br />After thirty minutes of this endurance test	 I gave up and walked out of the theater. Not surprisingly	 so did most of the cast members in attendance. <br /><br />Any curious genre fans would do well to stay away from this.

"Some movies you just know you're going to love from the first few seconds. This is one of those movies. Tracing it's roots back to ""Double Indemnity	"" and ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" in the 40's - this was a great example of Modern Film Noir in the 90's. Nick Cage plays the ""down on his luck"" main character who gets entangled in a husband-wife murder plot - and his luck goes from bad to worse to even worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people	 town	 violence and threat of Red Rock West. Lots of twists and turns	 great performances by Cage	 Hopper and Walsh	 an hypnotic slide-guitar musical backdrop	 and seamless directing make this a real joy. Favorite Line: When Cage looks at the empty gas gauge in the get-away car	 shakes his head and says: ""F***in' story of my life."""	1.0
"No Strings Attached features Carlos Mencia doing stand-up that makes us both laugh and think.

"Ladies and Gentlemen	please don't get fooled by ""A Stanley Kubrick"" film tag.This is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever made.Horror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror film.In Shining	there is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naive	foolish attempt made to create chilling horror.Everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality.All that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley. The hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good too.A word about the actors Jack Nicholson looks like a lost	lazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to do.There is not much to be said of a bald	colored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actor.No need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy.It cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor Kubrick is not alive to make any changes."	0.0
"I admired Rob Marshall for Chicago	 but Memoirs of Geisha turns out to be yet another failure of combing western and Asian arts. Overall	 the scene is beautiful	 but after restless emphasis on exoticism-oriented scenes some might just find himself fed up with them. The excessive cherry blossom was	 frankly	 overdone. It's probably the cultural difference of perception here: the ultimate beauty is not the showy type	 as truly beautiful geisha would not be the over westernised pumpkin in the movie. <br /><br />Some other comments have rightly mentioned the biggest flaws. As a Taiwanese	 I have no doubt the actress are great. An actor/actress can play any kind of role when he/she can look like it. Gong Li is great	 but the power of emotions that she showed in this movie had not been translated into Japanese style. All I saw was a bittersweet and jealous Chinese WOMAN. Michlle Yeoh	 one of my favourtie actress	 did not even LOOK LIKE a Japanese. Some comment has mentioned the peculiar delicate	 feminine characteristics of Japanese women	 with which I can't agree more. These are so delicate that I assume not even all modern Japanese actresses are eligible for the roles in Geisha	 let alone the two Chinese and one Malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know Japanese culture that much.<br /><br />Geisha is a good shot for arousing the curiosity of American audiences. But it would be an insult for the movie itself and for art alike if the movie wins the Oscar for best costume	 best director or best picture."	0.0
"This movie about two Italian brothers who came to Germany with their family is just great!<br /><br />It isn't an idealistic movie	 I would say it shows life as it is or was in the 60s and 70s when the main story takes place.

Great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time	 but that you can find happiness with ""fire and passion"" as the main character Gigi would say."	1.0
"I was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week. My 13 year old son was looking forward to it too. I rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen.<br /><br />Boy	 was I disappointed. This movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable. George C. Scott is an excellent actor but in this	 it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20% of the time. The rest of the time he was quite flat.<br /><br />I realize that this was made in '84	 pre-CG effects	 for the most part. But it looked to be very B-movie quality	 especially the encounter with Jacob Marley.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Spirit of Christmas Present takes Scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world	 observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of Christmastime.<br /><br />I will admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with the ""reformed"" Scrooge at the end. That was a refreshing portrayal.<br /><br />I wish that Bob Cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down-trodden. And Tiny Tim... oh don't even get me started on bad child actors..."	0.0
"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because there was a genuine sincerity in the acting. The writing was top-notch. James Arness is a great actor and he showed it here. Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett	 and can anyone really play Davy but Fess Parker?<br /><br />Another great actor in this move was Raul Julia	 who gave depth to Santa Anna	 a vain and complex person who led Mexico through turbulent times.<br /><br />While some may think the movie was slow-paced	 it captured the battle as it unfolded	 lots of tedium followed by a couple hours of horrific terror.<br /><br />What impressed me most about this movie is that it made you think about a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe in. In this day and age when nobody stands for anything	 I found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom	 no matter how you may feel about the politics of the time."	1.0
"I was but a babe in arms when George Lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world Saga chronicling the adventures of young Luke Skywalker and the notorious Darth Vadar but even today 20 years on I can appreciate the genius that is Lucas and the incredible imagination he's been blessed with. In A New Hope Lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky Princess Leia	 the Rougish Han Solo and the spirited Luke Skywalker as well as that best loved of villains	 the sinister Darth Vadar. In The Empire Strikes Back he went all out to show us Special Effects can add to a tale and managed to something no-one thought you could do on screen. He made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat. Return of the Jedi is a fitting end to a Saga that will stand the test of time.<br /><br />When The Empire Srtikes Back ended with encasing of the lovable Rouge Han Solo in Carbonite to be delivered to Jabba the Hut and young Luke reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his Father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse. Vadar it seemed had won the day. How we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow? In Lucas stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from Han's daring rescue from Jabba's palace to the the final climactic battle on the Death Star between Luke and Vadar as Luke struggles between fulfilling his duties as a Jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to reawaken the good he believes is still in his Father's soul.<br /><br />Old friends like the smooth talking Lando Calrissian and the ever lovable Chewbacca reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the Emperor himself ( played by the brilliant Ian McDiarmiud.How he missed out on an Oscar is a mystery.) desperate to turn Luke to the Dark Side even if it means betraying his apprentice Darth Vadar.All in black with his red eyes	ghostly white disfigured face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the undisputed Master of the events that unfold. His new and improved Death Star spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the Empire's reign for good. <br /><br />Lucas managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted. We watch in excitement as Han and Leia attempt to bring down the shield around the Death Star from the forest Moon of Endor with the help of some adorable Ewoks ( who I really do not believe take from the movie at all. In fact I feel they provide a sort reprieve from the tension of the battles at and in the Death Star) and hindered by legions of Stormtroopers and Imperial Officers. We cheer on Lando and the other pilots as they take on the mighty Imperial Fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the Deatn Star to destroy it once and for all. And we watch with bated breath as Vadar and the Emperor attempt to turn Luke to the Dark Side while he in turn tries to turn his Father back.<br /><br />But for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside Darth Vadar. For ROTJ is a battle of emotions and feelings. Vadar is caught between his loyalty to the Emporer and the Empire and his Fatherly inclinations to Luke. Never did I think that a mask could show emotion but some-how one can't but see the confusion and pain on Vadar's face during the final scenes as the Emporer turns on Luke. There is more depth and emotion to Vadar than I believed a villain	 especially one more machine then man could have and that I think is what makes him so accessible. He is conflicted. The Apprentice as much as the Master. The Victim as much as the Villain. Without ruining the end too much Vadar's final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy.<br /><br />So in conclusion what can I say. George Lucas is the master of the Saga. Star Wars is the most compelling and engaging Sagas I've seen in a long time and I have yet to see another Saga rival it. Return of the Jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending Lucas masterpiece deserves. It's action	 suspense	 romance	 tragedy	 redemption	 joy all rolled into one and it's memorable characters	 wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that Lucas can be proud of."	1.0
"From the first moment	 this ""thing"" is just an awful sequence of extremely short cuts of blurry camera work. While the overall plot has every potential for a thriller	 the story is so badly told that I'm unable to buy it. From the middle of the film	 the actions of characters don't make sense to me. Stop reading now to avoid SPOILERS.<br /><br />For instance	 Ed's idea to have Edna make coffee for them after having shot off her son's arm is way below his alleged experience; it's just an extremely stupid idea. Domino not questioning the fragmentary orders she receives from Claremont Williams over a breaking-up phone connection just eludes me; shouldn't she be long suspicious that Williams is turning them in? Those FBI agents seem out of their minds showing up with just one single helicopter to something they have every reason to consider a capital mafia shoot-out. Besides	 what they do by withholding and leaking information towards Cigliutti is pretty much incitement to murder; it seems to me like farewell to justice if that's they way the FBI does investigations. In reality	 they'd have a case messed up beyond repair if they acted like this. We get to see a car accident which normally would have at least seriously injured if not killed most of the passengers but miraculously leaves all of them with just a few bruises. Quite the contrary	 the accident is immediately followed by Domino making love to Choco	 which is from Domino's viewpoint in no way founded by previous events but just by being drugged to the eyeballs.<br /><br />The whole sequence of scenes starting from the phone call of Claremont Williams appears to me just as want-to-be dramatic razzle-dazzle. This combined with the awful	 uneasy camera work just makes a piece I hesitate to call a movie. I'm sorry for the wasted effort of the main actors	 whose talent is out of question."	0.0
"First of all this movie starts out on a really dumb note: A 10-year-old girl	 playing around in a moving vehicle	 decides it would be funny to cover up her mom's eyes with her hands	 and then causes a horrific accident which kills the mom....duh....I am sorry	 there is positively no 10-year-old that dumb. The rest of the movie does not get much better. After the death of the mother by the apparent dumbest 10-year-old on the planet	 the dad moves the family to Genova	 Italy	 where he is to teach at a local university	 but here is the clincher: he does not speak a word of Italian! Then the little girl has ""visions"" of mommy (who she killed)	 and often subsequent night terrors which always	 always end by the father holding and coddling her. Then we are forced to watch this family continually get lost and then found and then hug and then cry and lost and then found (followed by of course more hugging and crying) to the point that I was actually wishing for some sort of natural disaster to just wipe all of these vapid	 ignorant people off the planet. Do not get me wrong	 because I love indies	 but an indie about dumb people (and I mean really dumb) is simply ridiculous and pointless. It is really a shame that this movie was based on such insipid characters wallowing in such retarded scenarios	 because the locale was interesting."	0.0

"Interesting film about an actual event that took place during the Civil War in Vermont. It kept my attention to the end and I don't regret viewing it. I haven't ever read any on this raid incident so I was curious to see if the rebels pulled it off. I enjoy historical films from that era.<br /><br />My major complaint is with the Confederate uniforms. They look too good!!! The acting was a little stiff at times. I like the old man eating the mashed potatoes because he didn't have any teeth. The wounded soldier playing fetch with a hound was a little strange. Overall	 it was a descent film."	0.0
"I really can't remember who recommended this	 but they said it was one of their favorite films. It is certainly a strange one - like rubbernecking at a highway accident.<br /><br />Someone said that truth is stranger than fiction	 and the truth here is something to see. I really can't understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year. How can you improve on this? The aunt and cousin of Jackie Kennedy remove themselves from New York Society and hide in the Hampton's. In the process they become recluses and what is best described as ""crazy cat ladies."" They would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by Jackie. This film was done after that rescue. All during	 you couldn't help but think	 ""how bad was it before?"" It's a look at high society from the darker side	 and it is utterly fascinating."	1.0
"I saw this in the early 70s (when I was 16)	 and despite the long slow set-up	 meetings	 riots	 etc	 once the desert section began all fell into context and I loved it. (Still do	 it has aged very well.) Back then I was in what seemed to be a tiny minority. All criticisms seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and narrative. Happily I'm no longer in such a minority. <br /><br />It deftly shows (in a somewhat prophetic way) the political splintering	 unrest	 confrontation	 brutal repression	 commercialisation and deception which lay ahead.<br /><br />Appreciation for this magistral film has grown	 and I'm glad about that."	1.0
"An American in Paris is a wonderful musical about an American painter living in Paris for inspiration. He meets a rich woman who admires his paintings on the street and she believes she can get his work to be even more popular to the public	 e.g. in a museum. Golden Globe nominated Gene Kelly as the artist Jerry Mulligan is just perfect at both singing and especially dancing. He also meets the main girl Lise Bouvier (Leslie Caron) who is engaged to his best friend. He can't help his feelings for this girl	 even after he finds out who she is engaged to. Filled with nice romance and wonderful song and dance	 this is a very good musical film. It may drag slightly with his dancing dream sequence	 i.e. The American in Paris ballet	 but there is a good happy ending. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration	 Best Cinematography	 Best Costume Design	 Best Music	 Scoring of a Musical Picture	 Best Writing	 Story and Screenplay and Best Picture	 and it was nominated for Best Director for Vincente Minnelli and Best Film Editing	 it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source	 and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy	 and it was nominated for Best Director for Vincente Millenni (Liza's father). Gene Kelly was number 66 on The 100 Movie Stars	 and he was number 15 on 100 Years	 100 Stars - Men	 ""I Got Rhythm"" was number 32 on 100 Years	 100 Songs	 the film was number 9 on 100 Years of Musicals	 it was number 39 on 100 Years	 100 Passions	 it was number 68 on 100 Years	 100 Movies	 and it was number 58 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!"	1.0
"The title alone (along with the poster) is enough to give away ""The Projected Man"" as an obvious rip-off of ""The Fly"". And Bryant Haliday	 while much better than the typical IMDb review would have you think	 is nobody's idea of an acceptable stand-in for Vincent Price. Although	 come to think of it	 who would be	 unless Micheal Gough was available?? Still	 if you are in the mood to watch a British ""Hammer"" style movie with a science fiction theme about a teleportation experiment gone horribly wrong...well	 you still might want to give ""The Projected Man"" a pass and rummage around in the 'remaindered' bin at your local Wal-Mart for another teleporter-accident movie. Because this one just isn't all that good.<br /><br />Haliday caught a lot of good natured ribbing from the MST3K crew for his part in this movie and in ""Devil Doll""	 but he is actually the best thing in TPM. Maybe he can't carry the movie	 but he gets practically no help here from the screenplay. The script bogs down any forward momentum the plot may have in a mire of nonsense about funding and university politics and a guy named Lembach and some sinister cabal who want the teleportation machine to fail so they can steal its secrets...or something. So all the dramatic sequences in the first half of movie involve either phone calls or unconvincing special effects with transparent espresso machines and teleporting rats. Then when poor Haliday gets mutilated by his machine	 he has to spend the last part of the film wearing a diaper over half his face and rubber cement over the rest while he electrocutes various Londoners who chance across his path. Tom Cruise and Eric Roberts using bullhorns couldn't have made this screenplay work. <br /><br />Meanwhile all the other actors diligently try to inject life and interest into their roles for this turgid little project	 but the screenplay just swallows their efforts whole. The corrupt project administrator frets and fumes and hisses into the phone to his blackmailers	 all the while failing to notice that he looks like a werewolf outfitted in a tweed suit and a Tattersall vest. Haliday's research assistant and ex-girlfriend have the least convincing romance in the history of British horror cinema. His secretary is forced to parade around in her ""smalls"". None of it really works or gels into a real movie. And it all just kind of stops dead	 leaving the viewer going	 ""Eh? excuse me	 wasn't there supposed to be an ENDING here??""<br /><br />Still	 for all its problems	 I can easily name a dozen horror movies from the same period that were as bad or worse	 and so could anyone else who follows movies (or who has ever browsed the IMDb ""Bottom 100""). I wouldn't actually pay money to own ""Projected Man""	 but if it were included in some compilation along with a dozen other movies in a DVD collection	 I'd probably feel OK about having it. It's a harmless diversion	 perfect for a horror movie film festival	 to watched with friends while consuming many beers and snacks on a Saturday evening."	0.0
"I've always been a great fan of Woody Allen and always will be for most of what he did in the past	 but only a blind lover could ignore how dull	 meaningless	 pretentious and most of all horrendously acted this movie is. A vacuous mental masturbation based on inconsistent grounds. And what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate a presumed ""actor Allen-clone""	 that is putting into Will Farrell's mouth and gestures what Allen would have done in Farrell's place had he been 30 years younger. The outcome was obviously ludicrous. And not to speak of the dialogues... what was intended to be philosophical reflections turned into an involuntary mockery of intellectual pondering	 unaware of its comic effect. How sad..."	0.0
"Taking old collection of stories poses a challenge for the production team	 how can this classic character be brought up to date and make it interesting enough to capture a new audience while stirring memories from her former audience. In my opinion	 their mission was accomplished. A must see for young children	 pre-teens	 teens	 and their parents. OK there are a couple scary moments that are resolved in short order	 but parents with young children should sit tight	 the movie moves on to better things. I am going to go with those astute user reviewers who point out that Emma Roberts provides us with a positive role model for young women	 not syrupy about it either. Nancy balances her femininity with career minded sleuthing skills. A lot to like in here	 laughs	 doesn't take itself too seriously	 a real mystery to solve (one you can figure out yourself as an added bonus	 and likable characters. Nancy Drew even makes a good date movie in my opinion."	1.0
"This show will succeed because it appeals to all adults no matter where they are in their relationship. As a man married for 26 years	 I empathize with Patrick Warburton's character: he loves his wife	 but he assumes she knows that. I also enjoy his monotone delivery; never gets too excited or too low. A nice ensemble of characters. This will be a nice addition to the Monday night line-up.<br /><br />I don't know how David Spade will be in his role. He is best enjoyed in small doses. He also seems a little old to still be trolling for women.<br /><br />I enjoyed the pilot and I look forward to seeing how the series develops."	1.0
"George Lopez never caught my interest in his stand up comedy and he still doesn't. But this show is a work of art. It's not ever show where the jokes keep you laughing every time you remember it (and jokes that re memorable at that). This show just has an upbeat look to it and the characters range from an old	 short drunk to an dyslexic teenager. I don't know who writes this show but that person does a great job. If they had just continued the show I'm sure that it would get a positive response from the critics of this great country. If you are looking for a good	 traditional comedy	 then George Lopez is the show for you! The one bad thing is the title. George Lopez? Really? Imagine the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air being ""Will Smith"". C'mon man! But otherwise	 this show is genius! 10/10"	1.0
"I first saw this when they showed this around easter time 1993/4 and didn't think much of it then	 I bought this on DVD last summer when I started getting into Michael Jackson (I liked his music before) and enjoyed it more now I am older. It is a good film but it won't be this classic film like The Sound Of Music	 West Side Story	 The Wizard Of Oz etc. Michael Jackson as an actor was good and so were the other cast members. There were a disturbing scenes like the little girl Katie getting slapped by the gangster Frankie Lideo who was played by Joe Pesci. The scene that frightened me when I was younger was when Michael turns into a robot. My favourite song on the film was Smooth Criminal I think it was better than Thriller in my opinion."	1.0
"I'm sorry to say this	 but the acting in this film is horrible. The dialogue sounds as if they are reading their lines for the first time ever. Perhaps I got the ""dress rehearsal"" version by mistake. The director over-uses slow motion during special effects perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves. The story is pretty well written	 and the fight sequences are actually better than I have seen in many action films. The fights seem pretty real. But all of this happens while to two leading actors time and time again miraculously survive incredible amounts of point-blank automatic weapon fire	 grenades	 morter rounds	 and bazookas. The enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots I have ever seen	 especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about 30 yards	 and every bazooka shot is wide by at least 50 feet. Those bazookas need serious site calibration."	0.0
"I actually didn't start watching the show until it came on FX. I was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the show's reruns were premiering so i decided to watch it. I was so upset that I had not watched the show when it first aired on t.v. I loved the show so much!Finally a show for everyone to enjoy. I remember Full House and Family Matters and Step by Step and they were okay shows but just not funny enough. They would make dumb jokes and laugh over things that were just plain stupid	 but not That 70s Show. That 70s Show was hilarious	 smart and so real. I think it was the best show ever made and I'm very sorry that it ended. Although I love this show	 I do think it should have ended on the seventh season when Eric and Kelso leave. The last season was just not right	 Eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character leaves. I still love this show and I hope TV starts making more shows like this one."	1.0
"I enjoyed this film yet hated it because I wanted to help this guy! I am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business...who are now still trying to become adults....no more fans	groupies	money etc...and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life...as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight...it is almost like they have to begin anew...this film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the 70's and 80's are going through now....and that's where I find the film sad and depressing.BUT it portrays the life of an old rock star-abandoned and lost-in a believable way.The young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of Hollis maclaren (Outrageous)...and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for. This film is a must have for folks in their 50's who have seen the rise and fall of bands	people who knew the members	 and have watched them hurt as age creeps in	and popularity fades.This is an almost perfect movie....sad but in a way positive....because of the whales. A MUST SEE!"	1.0
"I think a round of applause is in order for whoever pieced together the trailer for Rogue Pictures' latest release	 'The Return'. I myself	 along with everyone else have been duped into believing it is in fact a horror film. On the contrary though	 its actually a supernatural thriller. Too bad it is not the least bit thrilling.<br /><br />'The Return' stars Sarah Michelle Gellar as Joanna Mills	 a young woman who has had personal problems since the age of eleven. It was at that age that she began having haunting visions depicting the murder of a woman whom she has never met. While in Texas on a business trip	 she is led by these visions to the murdered woman's hometown	 La Salle. There she comes face to face with another person who has frequently appeared in her visions. A man by the name of Terry Stahl	 who is played by Peter O'Brien. Joanna is now on a desperate search for answers. A search that could in the end result in her very own murder.<br /><br />I really don't know where to begin here folks. Which should I mention first? The atrocious acting	 hideous directing	 or the terribly bland story? No matter which one I choose my point behind each is the same: they simply suck. Adam Sussman's screenplay is downright moronic. Its not interesting. Its not compelling. Its just plain unpleasant. I kept waiting for something to jumpstart the ""film"" (I've placed quotations around film because I don't believe 'The Return' deserves to be called an actual film due to it's foulness.) and at least give it some slight chance of hope	 but nothing ever happened. I was left out in an unbearable cold to freeze. Not even stellar performances from the actors themselves could have saved this disaster. Of course they probably knew this having read the script then agreeing to do the ""film"". I assume this is why the acting was so awful. At least that's what I'm choosing to believe. I really hope the cast doesn't pride themselves on their performances. They need immediate medical attention if they do.<br /><br />Now the directing was unmistakably bad	 but I can't quite crucify Asif Kapadia entirely. (Well I could	 but I won't since I'm such a nice guy.) I look at 'The Return' as a test for Kapadia because for all of you that don't know	 this is his first full-length feature ""film"". He's just getting his foot in the door and still learning. Next time around	 well if there is a next time	 hopefully he will have improved vastly. The only thing he was able to accomplish here was almost completely duplicating the visual style of Marcus Nispel's 2003 re-make of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. Now that's nice the ""film"" was given that	 but unfortunately he still won't be receiving any kudos from me for that. Copying someone else's work isn't something I consider to be praise worthy. (Even if it is from a film I very much enjoyed.)<br /><br />I think Jim Sonzero's American re-make of 'Pulse' will now have to fork over the title of Worst Film of the Year to 'The Return'. It beyond question is deserving of the title in almost every imaginable way. Now I don't doubt this will make a small	 and I mean very small	 profit. No matter what though	 it won't surpass or even parallel the fluke success of Gellar's previous acting effort	 'The Grudge'. On that note	 there's one last thing I'd like to add. I can honestly say I had never been embarrassed to have been seen leaving a theater auditorium until seeing 'The Return'. That is something I never wish to experience again	 along with the ""film"" itself."	0.0
"This movie had all the elements to be a smart	 sparkling comedy	 but for some reason it took the dumbass route. Perhaps it didn't really know who its audience was: but it's hardly a man's movie given the cast and plot	 yet is too slapstick and dumb-blonde to appeal fully to women.<br /><br />If you have seen Legally Blonde and its sequel	 then this is like the bewilderingly awful sequel. Great actors such as Luke Wilson should expect better material. Jessica Simpson could also have managed so much more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller languish in supporting roles that are silly rather than amusing.<br /><br />Many things in this movie were paint-by-numbers	 the various uber-cliché montages	 the last minute ""misunderstanding""	 even the kids' party chaos. This just suggests lazy scriptwriting.<br /><br />It should be possible to find this movie enjoyable if you don't take it seriously	 but it's such a glaring could-do-better than you'll likely feel frustrated and increasingly disappointed as the scenes roll past."	0.0
"I haven't seen anything this bad since I walked out of the James Bond movie ""Moonraker"" twenty years ago. I managed to sit through the entirety of this one only because of Tilda Swinton	 but there was nothing she could do to save this beast.<br /><br />As a cross between ""Pi""	 ""Orlando""	 and ""Tron""	 this movie failed miserably in every aspect of moviemaking. The characters were cardboard and unable to evoke any kind of sympathy. The plot was wholly unbelievable. The acting was	 with the exception of Swinton	 amateur. The computer graphics were worse than in ""Tron."" Timothy Leary was extremely annoying. I could go on	 but what's the point.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about this film is that Tilda Swinton was in it. I have no idea why an actress of her caliber consented to appear in such a dud	 but she most likely regrets it now.<br /><br />Don't waste your money or your time on this stinker. There's nothing worth seeing here."	0.0
"I was looking forward to seeing Amanda Peet in another good role after recently renting ""The Whole Nine Yards""--easily worth the rental	 by the way--but this wasn't it.<br /><br />I remembered that the trailer for ""Whipped"" was somewhat funny and the plot about three oversexed New Yorker twenty somethings all falling for and getting manipulated by the charming Ms. Peet was worth a shot. So	 I convinced two friends one afternoon to come see this movie with me. This review is my penance.<br /><br />In the first act we have the three lead studs	 recounting their conquests in a diner. What should have been funny	 or at least telling	 comes out rather pathetic. Was there any redeeming quality about the three men and their encounters that we were supposed to get out of this?<br /><br />[And while I don't mind movies that are cheerfully vulgar	 I kept wondering why no one in the diner turned around when the studs talk loudly about sexual and scatalogical details. They do this every week at the same diner? You would think someone would complain. Oh	 wait	 I forgot: two other diners do notice in one scene. But this is just a setup for a punchline. Everyone else in the diner is deaf.]<br /><br />The second act has the three studs all falling for Mia and then developing brain rot	 failing to ask each other or her about what's really happening between the four of them. And I kept asking myself	 as the studs keep acting like they have been	 what redeeming qualities does she see in them to stick with them longer than one date? Does she start out with brain rot? I kept hoping for Eric's character	 the married buddy	 to become something more than simply the annoying punching bag in this act. His role is clearly to dispense advice on being married. But why do they even bother to talk to him when they won't talk to each other? And his advice? Sheeesh!<br /><br />The third act resolves what plot there is but by this time I was looking at my watch. My friends told me they were still waiting for something genuinely funny to happen and I had to agree. The Scene That Explains All was adequate and managed to explain all of the questions and mysterious dialogue bits throughout the movie but we were just checking them off a list. (""Oh	 okay	 that's why Brad had that happen and Jonathan says this and..."")<br /><br />What laughs we made were from the stupidity of the plot than at anything amusing. Even the outtakes during the credits weren't very funny. Ultimately I was left with nothing except a desire to warn people away from this movie.<br /><br />Rating: 3"	0.0
"I first saw this movie when I was a little kid and fell in love with it at once. The sets are breath taking and some of the script is damn right hilarious: ""You sons of a thousand fleas"".<br /><br />It is always shown on TV late at night or really early in the morning i woke up at about 3:00 am once and it had just started. TV companys need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time Sunday so everyone can get a chance to view this fine work.<br /><br />10/10"	1.0
"I am a huge Willem Dafoe fan	 and really sought out this film (I had to get a Region 5 Chinese DVD of it!). But	 it is truly one of the worst that I've seen in quite a while.<br /><br />The acting (except for Dafoe) is horrible. Dafoe and Colagrande BOTH wrote and directed this ( though he isn't credited as a director)	 and they have NO discernible talents for writing or directing. (Stick to acting Willem; Giada get out of the business	 PLEASE!)<br /><br />Absolutely nothing happens. Except a series of completely unconvincing	 totally without believable motivation	 acts by these two people (that just met) in this house. Colagrande's sleepy	 I couldn't care less expression practically NEVER changes. And the sex scenes are downright lame. I actually cringed twice at one of them. Yuck! They're definitely not the least bit erotic	 and yet are the only time the film isn't putting you to sleep. Then	 it's busy repulsing you.<br /><br />Just awful."	0.0
"In 1993	 ""the visitors"" was an enormous hit in France. So	 the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately	 this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made. <br /><br />This is a movie that doesn't keep its promises. Indeed	 it's supposed to tell a sole story. Jean Reno must go in the twentieth century and take Christian Clavier back in the Middle Ages so that time can normally follow its course. The problem is that Clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century	 and so make him get back in the Middles Ages is rather hard... Instead of this	 the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot. As a consequence	 the movie becomes sometimes muddle-headed	 sometimes a bit of a mess.<br /><br />But the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors. Reno and Clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie: they're going over the top and become annoying. Then	 why did Jean-Marie Poiré the film-maker engage Muriel Robin in the female main role? He made a mistake because she seems ill-at-ease and is absolutely pitiful. The other actors aren't better: Marie-Anne Chazel is nonexistent and Christian Bujeau	 unbearable.<br /><br /> Of course	 the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness. Certain sequences and dialogs are affected. It also appears hollow because Poiré takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie. Thus	 a young girl takes Reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding.<br /><br />A labored and disappointing follow-up. Anyway	 what's the interest of this movie otherwise commercial?<br /><br />"	0.0
"German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible: he's unseated fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made.<br /><br />Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium. This film is as shoddy and laughable as the best-worst of EW. I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto	 morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set. The answer is: subterranean; Lommel dug a pit and buried it.<br /><br />The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies. Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles	 where every auto mechanic	 doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered	 could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face.<br /><br />The main character	 a villainous beat cop	 is played by a German actor with a thick German accent. Aside from being a serial killer	 he is also the oldest beat cop in LA. Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody	 then drags them into his home (which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse)	 and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners	 the LAPD refuses to investigate	 going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment.<br /><br />The sets are excruciatingly bad. The production designer's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint ""Precinct 707"" on a cardboard wall.<br /><br />Since the actors were obviously unpaid non-professionals--a sad assortment of European emigres (possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands)	 bimbos	 mimbos	 and desperate middle-aged women--and since little if any money was spent on sets	 special efx	 locations or other production value	 it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine-looking police uniforms. Sadly	 they couldn't afford a police car; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental.<br /><br />More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him. One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies. The other fits right in	 with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated.<br /><br />The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie	 as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her. Don't ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered	 just accept Lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride.<br /><br />After much prolonged hand-clawing out of straw-covered roadside graves	 the zombie girls manage to make their appearance. They look exactly as they did before death	 maybe even prettier	 with black glamor make-up generously airbrushed around their eyes. Looking nothing like zombies	 they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway.<br /><br />At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll	 and injects large doses of cheesy Euro-trash techno into the soundtrack. We're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise. Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty.<br /><br />Unlike other zombies	 Lommel's girls speak and function as normal... er	 I mean	 as they did before becoming zombified. This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog. Yes	 a golden shower it is.<br /><br />I won't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending. All I can say is it's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece. The spirit of Ed Wood lives on... or should I say his geist."	0.0

"In the classic sense of the four humors (which are not specific to the concept of funny or even entertainment)	 Altman's ""H.E.A.L.T.H."" treats all of the humors	 and actually in very funny	 entertaining ways. There's the Phlegm	 as personified by Lauren Bacall's very slow	 guarded	 and protective character Esther Brill	 who's mission in life appears to be all about appearance	 protecting the secrets of her age and beauty more than her well-being. There's Paul Dooley's Choleric Dr. Gil Gainey	 who like a fish out of water (perhaps more like a seal) flops around frenetically	 barking and exhorting the crowds to subscribe to his aquatic madness. The Melancholy of Glenda Jackson's Isabella Garnell smacks of Shakespeare's troubled and self-righteous Hamlet -- even proffering a soliloquy or two. And let's not forget Henry Gibson's Bile character	 Bobby Hammer (""The breast that feeds the baby rules the world""). Then there's the characters Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett	 respectively)	 relatively sane characters striving to find some kind of balance amongst all the companion and extreme humors who have convened for H.E.A.L.T.H. -- a kind of world trade organization specializing in H.E.A.L.T.H.	 which is to say anything but health. This is Altman at his classic best."	1.0
"Near the beginning of ""The Godfather: Part III	"" Michael Corleone's son wants to drop out of law school and become a musician. Michael Corleone does not want this. But his estranged ex-wife	 Kay	 manages to convince him to let Anthony Corleone pursue music as he wishes. So he does.<br /><br />That seems like an odd way to start a review	 as it is a minor plot point and has nothing really to do with the major action. Just bear with me here; you'll see where I'm going with this eventually. Now let me tell you about the major plot. It is about Michael Corleone wanting to quit crime for good (he has largely abandoned all criminal elements in his family business). But then along comes Vincent Mancini	 an illegitimate nephew	 who is involved in a feud. So of course Michael must endure yet another brush with criminality and gun violence and all that good gangster stuff. Meanwhile	 Vincent has a semi-incestuous affair with Michael's daughter Mary. Oh	 and Michael and Kay are trying to patch up all the horrid things that happened at the end of Part II.<br /><br />It is like a soap opera. One horrid	 awful	 169-minute soap opera. Gone is any sort of the sophistication	 romance	 and emotional relevance that made the first two movies hit home so hard. After a 16-year break in the franchise	 Francis Ford Coppola delivered a mess of sop and pretentiousness entirely incongruous with the first two films	 once again proving his last great work was ""Apocalypse Now"" back in the 1970's.<br /><br />What's worse	 ""The Godfather: Part III"" isn't even a logical follow-up of ""The Godfather: Part II."" Michael is a completely different person. He hasn't just gone to seed (which might be legitimate	 even if it'd be no fun to watch). He's become a goody-goody that's trying to fix all the tragedy that made Part II such a devastating masterpiece. His confession to the priest was bad enough	 but that little diabetes attack in the middle pushed it over to nauseating. He also gets back together with Kay! For heaven's sakes	 there is absolutely no way that should happen	 as the 2nd movie made abundantly clear! She aborted his baby	 and his Sicilian upbringing made him despise her for it. Didn't Francis Ford Coppola even think of these things?<br /><br />And don't even get me started on Mary and Vincent's affair! For a romance so forbidden	 it was shockingly unengaging. Sofia Coppola's acting did nothing to help. She made the smartest move of her life when she switched from in front of the camera to behind it	 because she was possibly THE worst actress I have ever seen in a Best Picture nominee. Every line she delivered was painfully memorized	 and every time the drama rested on her acting abilities	 all she elicited was inappropriate giggles. In the climactic scene--I won't go into detail	 but you'll know which scene I'm talking about when/if you watch it--she looks at Michael and says	 ""......Daddy?"" I think I was meant to cry	 but the line was delivered so poorly I burst out into long	 loud laughter!<br /><br />Now we get to the climax	 and now you will also realize why I took time to start the review with a description of Anthony Corleone's musical ambitions. After 140 minutes of petty drama and irrelevant happenstances	 Anthony Corleone returns... with an opera! So Michael	 Kay	 Mary	 and Vincent go to see it	 and for about 10-15 minutes a couple killers walk around trying to assassinate Michael. About this climactic sequence	 I must say one thing: It was really good! But not because of the killers--they were pretty boring. I just really liked the opera. It had some great music and real great set pieces. And	 from what little it showed us	 it seemed that the story had echoes of the Corleone family's origin. I'll bet it was one swell opera	 and I'll bet Michael Corleone was glad he let his son switch from law school to music.<br /><br />My biggest wish is this: that Francis Ford Coppola had merely filmed Anthony Corleone's opera for 169 minutes and ditched the rest of the soggy melodrama. Better yet	 I wish he hadn't made ""The Godfather: Part III"" at all. Part II gave us the perfect ending. This spin off was self-indulgent and unnecessary.<br /><br />P.S. This is not a gut reaction to the film. I watched all 3 Godfather films over a month ago (though I was rewatching the first one). Not only does this mean that my expectations for Part III weren't screwed (in fact	 I had set the bar rather low for it after what I heard)	 but it also means I've had a good time to think about all three films. While I was a bit disappointed with Part II at first	 the more I thought about it	 the better it seemed. But with Part III	 it was bad to begin with	 then got worse the more I thought about it. The sad thing is that many people will stop with Part I	 but if they watch Part II as well	 they will most likely go on to Part III. If you have the will	 watch Parts I & II and pretend like Part III never existed."	0.0
"I figured that it's about time I let this one out. Pokémon fans are suffering in America these days. Why? Because we rely on Kids WB and 4Kids Entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies. As far as the series goes	 they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the Japanese versions to television. So what is their problem when it comes to the movies? Honestly now	 I have seen all three Pokémon movies in Japanese and I will definitely be seeing the fourth one. They are excellent movies. They are all enjoyable and fun to watch. And	 after seeing Pokémon 2000 in theaters	 I can't help but wonder how these American producers read the Japanese scripts. The way it appears	 it seems that they read and see something that says `Insert empty moral here' in big bold faced letters. It definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on MSB (extreme sarcasm there) and created this crap.<br /><br />*possible spoilers from here on*<br /><br />Well	 I guess I should first talk about Pikachu's Rescue Adventure. My first gripe with this came with no narration. I guess they got enough bad comments on the Pokédex narration that plagued Pikachu's Vacation	 and	 instead of going with a caring	 gentle woman's voice as appeared in Pikachu no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai	 they just cut the narration all together. This wouldn't have been a problem	 except for one thing. Did anyone really understand why the Exeggcute didn't let Togepi go until the end? Possibly the fans	 but I'm sure not the parents. Then	 there's the theme song. I couldn't help but roll my eyes at this one. The Japanese theme song was `Tankentai wo Tsukurou' and was sung by Japanese children. It was fun and enjoyable. This one: nauseating. Now	 one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing Kireihana. Nice music	 fun to watch. That's changed with the Bellossom. The music sucked for one	 but on top of that	 they had all the Pokémon talk during the music	 which turned out to be jumpy	 annoying	 and just unnecessary. Oh	 and then there's the Poliwhirl who thinks he's a Poliwrath. You'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are. Basically	 not much could save this little ill fated dub	 which is very unfortunate considering its potential. But	 I haven't touched on the worst of it yet.<br /><br />You'd think that the warning signs would've been apparent to me when I received my issue of Nintendo Power. For some unfathomable reason	 I had been placing some faith in 4Kids and the WB. My thoughts were `well	 they screwed up on the first movie	 but the second is different as far as the theme goes	 so they should do well.' That in mind	 I just didn't pay attention to the warning signs I encountered in the theaters when the trailers said	 `You will believe that one person can make all the difference.' With the way they said that at every turn	 I was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like MSB did at the end of the English version. Then comes Nintendo Power	 in which I see all my fears realized in the words `the main feature 'The Power of One.' At that point	 I became a bit more uneasy. `The Power of One?!' Not a good sign. However	 I still kept some of my false faith. Big mistake.<br /><br />Sitting in the theater	 I was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which I loved in Japanese being turned into complete and utter junk. I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle. I can see a point in that since they didn't pander this thing	 repeating it over and over like in MSB. However	 it did more damage than anything else in this movie. First of all	 the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read `the world turns to Ash.' Ah hah. So	 Ash is the chosen one? Whatever. In the Japanese version	 the inhabitants of Arshia needed a Pokémon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony. This time	 he's the chosen one. A greater way that this did damage was to Lugia. Lugia was one of the coolest characters in a Pokémon movie.... when the movie was ABOUT Lugia. In this one	 Lugia is forced to take a back seat to Ash. In the scene where they're flying back to the main island	 Lugia and Ash are discussing the conditions of Lugia's existence	 not that Ash is going to make all the difference. Overall in this category	 Ash wasn't really the `one person' that would make the difference	 since he was helped by many along the way.<br /><br />A lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking. Furura's flute song wasn't nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the Japanese one. Jirarudan's speech to them saying his collection `started with a Mew card?' Ugh. Even worse	 Misty's outrage originally concerned the way Moltres and Zapdos were being held. `Why didn't you put them in Pokéballs when you caught them? This is like caging them to be displayed.' Much different from whining about him thinking Pokémon are things to be collected like stamps. If there were any real redeeming values in this	 they came from Team Rocket. Some pretty funny lines. Not really to make me laugh out loud	 but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach. Well	 that was officially the last American Pokémon movie I'm going to see. I've imported the third one and find it very enjoyable. I would rather not see another Japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two. I'll be importing the fourth one as well. Forget you	 Kids WB and 4Kids. You have forsaken me for the last time."	0.0
"...which isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Overall	 ""DinoCroc"" was a much better movie. Sure	 in that movie Matt Borlenghi played a complete wuss-bag who spent the entire movie crying about his little brother getting eaten by the DinoCroc. But the special effects in ""DinoCroc"" were better	 the plot lines were better	 and the acting was better. Here are the problems with ""Blood Surf"" -- 1) the killer crocodile looks like a kid's model with a retractable jaw. 2) the plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. get shipwrecked on a deserted island	 in which they encounter a rabid group of ugly Filipino natives who try to force themselves upon the women in the group. Which was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film. And 3) there's not enough croc time. There are a couple of redeeming qualities of ""Blood Surf"" -- the actresses are pretty attractive and Matt Borlenghi gets eaten by the croc towards the end of the movie. But if you're on your deathbed and only have enough time to watch one Matt Borlenghi/killer crocodile movie	 skip this one and fire up ""DinoCroc"" instead."	0.0
"What can i say about a tale such as this? This magical tale has followed me from my early childhood	evoking warm memories in my heart.The characters take you to to so many whimsical places making you want more of each scene. For example in the market there were so many different flavors of lore. I loved the exotic dancers that accompanied the steel drums.<br /><br />The story line was wonderful.I wanted so badly for Landsbury to decide to keep the precocious children and for her to also stay with Mr.Brown	and find the other half of the spell so that the men less armor could win the war.<br /><br />I am still a child inside	and this movie appeals to my inner child like no other. This movie is my definite favorite of all times. I hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept away	and transported into another time."	1.0
"Allow yourself to be transported to a different	 old school kind of storytelling. Scoop is classic Woody Allen.<br /><br />Allen's latest muse	 Scarlett Johansson (who also appeared in last year's Match Point	 also by Allen)	 is surprisingly able to tone down her sultry sex kitten appeal and transform into a normal looking student-type with the aid of nerdish glasses and outfits but still fails to make the audience believe how Hugh Jackman's lordly character can be so smitten by her	 given the royal's background (don't worry	 no spoilers here). There are no grand transformations for Johansson's character here	 as she consistently plays the same character throughout despite the script saying otherwise. You even forgive her character's apparent lack of logic	 continuing an affair with a suspected serial killer	 simply because he is His Royal Hotness Jackman	 who is refreshing to see sans the Wolverine duds.<br /><br />If anything	 consistency is what the 70-year old Allen is all about. He continues to tell his stories on celluloid in the same way he always has; as if he's never been exposed to modern film-making	 which is probably what makes his quiet	 simple films appealing. They never seem to aim for a specific market; as if Allen makes movies to his taste alone	 whether the public likes it or not."	1.0

"The movie has only one flaw	 unfortunately this flaw damages all credibility of the piece.<br /><br />It starts with the condemnation of the Israeli occupation of disputed territories. It fails to address the reason Israelis are there. Egypt	 Syria	 Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel. This is why Israel ""occupys"" their land	 because those countries lost it in a war they started.<br /><br />The film also claims that Israel has defied the U N by not complying with Resolution 242. Problem is	 242 was rejected immediately upon it's inception by.....the palestinians	 making it void.<br /><br />Many films are put together well	 and can really show footage that changes minds	 but remember	 when watching anything	 believe none of what you hear	 and only half of what you see.<br /><br />All participants in this film are known critics of Israel	 and some have made many antisemitic public comments	 removing any possible credibility to their words.<br /><br />All participants are in dire need of a actual history lesson taught objectively	 not by some palestinian sympathizer."	0.0
"I shouldn't even review this movie	 since it's not actually a horror movie -- and thus not worthy of Dr. Cheese's attention. At least	 it's not horror in the usual sense. It's certainly a horrifying proposition to waste your time watching this crap. That's why I turned it off after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise	 then	 when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed. Yep	 that's right; in plain terms	 this movie is b-o-r-i-n-g.<br /><br />""The Order"" had lots of flaws	 not all of them unique. In particular	 it seems to me the main problem with the ""religious"" subgenre of horror films is Hollywood's unwillingness to engage Christianity on its own terms. It is quite possible to make truly creepy films that are also orthodox. Just ask William Peter Blatty. In fact	 without orthodoxy	 films like this are just an anything-goes smorgasbord of the filmmakers' (usually dull and illogical) imaginations.<br /><br />Think about it. If someone made a movie ostensibly about	 say	 physics	 but not only got the basic laws of physics wrong	 but based the entire plot on its wrong portrayals	 you would soon get tired of the resulting pointless plot. The same goes for these sorts of movies.<br /><br />In other words	 ""The Order""(and many similar movies before it) invent out of whole cloth stuff about the Catholic Church and about the Christian faith and attempt to build a plot out of these inventions. Unsurprisingly	 the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid. This movie has the added charm of being as interesting to watch as your toenails growing.<br /><br />Avoid this steaming pile."	0.0
"Both visually and musically stunning. A treat for both the eye and the ear. The quintessential Victorian element of the opening sequences were completely enchanting	 helping to create a Christmas scene of which Dickens himself would have been justifiably proud. Technically the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are both imaginatively devised and creatively achieved in a traditional stage setting. The dancing of many of the lead artistes is breathtakingly good. The photography and lighting are first class and the sound recording admirably matches the overall high level of technical skills employed. A great film for all the family at Christmas time and a most delightful discovery which will withstand multiple viewing."	1.0
"This slick and gritty film consistently delivers. It's one of Frankenheimer's best and most underrated films and it's easily the best Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking ""but I loved GET SHORTY"" you need to be punched in the face). In my opinion	 no one captures the ""feel"" for Leonard's characters better then John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) elevates the story's sleaze factor to amazing heights. Be a man	 have a few beers and watch this movie. For reference purposes my favorite Leonard books are: Swag	 Rum Punch	 Cat Chaser	 City Primeval	 and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a real special place in my cold	 movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday."	1.0
"I saw this movie back in 1984	 we first started watching ""This Is Spinal Tap"" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. So we went instead to see this movie. If you have any conspiracy theory's going around in your head	 you will want to watch this one. <br /><br />The question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie are: Do you think the government would be capable of doing this? (In my opinion there is no doubt that they could) <br /><br />But I don't want to give out too much information as that would be a spoiler and I think that you should view the movie for yourself.<br /><br />But	 just to let you know	 we still talk about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world to do."	1.0

"I read Schneebaum's book (same title as this film) when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of ""otherness"" (his own and the people of the Amazon with whom he lived and loved) to a way of living a decent life. His subsequent books were not as powerful	 but showed his continuing quest. His description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60's	 but his honesty and openness about it were welcome. This movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man	 but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a morally positive term	 in this case) that occurs when ""civilized"" men intrude on traditional societies. Even so	 Schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness."	1.0
"Unfortunately	 this movie never made it to DVD. I saw it when it was first released to the theaters in 1983	 and then again when the VHS was released in 1992. When I recently saw a VHS copy at a flea market	 I immediately bought it. I was not disappointed. First	 the obvious: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and a joy to behold. But then	 the film takes you into an unreal world where you have to reflect on your values and decide what is really important to you. The movie is about a lot of things. It is about how the World Bank and large corporations exploit and enslave developing countries with their capitalist schemes to force them into a debt that they can never repay. It is about how our economic system exploits us by forcing us into debt with credit cards	 mortgage	 and car payment. It is about trying to save an innocence that maybe we have never really had and maybe we cannot really save. It is about good and evil and about how hard it is sometimes to tell one from the other. It raises a lot of questions but does not give answers. I think sometimes this is good. For this reason	 this is a film really worth saving and seeing."	1.0
"This is one of the funniest movies I have seen. I watched it on DVD	 and the disc does not have any special features	 or even a menu	 but that is not necessarily what I care about. <br /><br />I tend to judge movies on a case by case basis	 depending on	 among other things	 if it is a big studio production or a smaller film. This is a smaller film and I am willing to forgive minor things. That said	 I believe it has one of the most imaginative and original title sequences that I have seen.<br /><br />I enjoyed the acting of all of the major players. I especially enjoyed Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has most of the funniest lines. The character portrayed by Claire Forlani might come across as unrealistic to some people	 but I have personally known real people with emotional problems that very readily look at life's decisions as her character does. That helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the veneer of her humor.<br /><br />This is not a movie for children	 obviously	 but it does NOT engage in gratuitous sex and nudity. There is quite a bit of adult language	 though	 but it can sometimes be very funny. (In particular	 Alan Arkin's character	 who can't even swear correctly.)<br /><br />Also watch for the cameos from known character actors."	1.0
"What a horrible	 horrible film. The worst collection of cliches I have seen in a long time. Not that I saw much. I left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves. Meryl Streep was awful as usual. How many hurt and tortured expressions can 1 person have? Aidan Quinn's talents were - as so often - totally wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan she could act? Trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes.

"Siskel & Ebert were terrific on this show whether you agreed with them or not because of the genuine conflict their separate professional opinions generated. Roeper took this show down a notch or two because he wasn't really a film critic and because he substituted snide for opinionated. Now	 when Ben Lyons comes on I feel like I'm watching ""Teen News"" -- you know	 that kids' news show	 hosted by kids for kids? Manckiewitz is not much better. It's obvious they've encountered only a steady diet of mainstream films their entire lives. The idea that these two rank amateurs have anything of interest or consequence to say about motion pictures is ludicrous. If they are reviewing a non-formula film	 they are completely lost. Show them something original and intelligent -- they just find it ""confusing"". Wait -- I think I get it ... ABC is owned by Disney ... Disney makes movies for kids. While Siskel	 Ebert	 and Roper promoted independent films and were only hit-or-miss with the big budget studio productions -- what a surprise: these two guys LOVE the big studio schlock and only manage to tolerate a few indies. Plus everyone knows the age group TV advertisers are aiming for. The blatant nepotism is the icing on the cake. In what alternate universe do these guys qualify as film critics?"	0.0
"I probably doubled my knowledge of Iran when I saw Secret Ballot (2001). Now I know about four times as much (I doubt I learned a whole heck of a lot from Not Without My Daughter (1991)).<br /><br />Offside is a splendid budget Iranian comedy about a group a girls (working individually) to attend a decisive soccer match for their country's place in the World Cup. Women are not allowed to attend soccer matches	 so the nation's armed forces have been mobilized to save any women who try to enter from themselves. Some (teen?) girls try to crash the party by dressing as boys	 but are caught. The movie is mostly set at this holding pen where the girls are detained by soldiers	 awaiting some unspecified punishment (although	 the girl who dressed as a soldier claims that she was one insignia away from being executed!)<br /><br />The movie explores the absurdity of the situation. The thinking that bars women from football matches comes down to it being too raunchy an experience for the fairer sexa philosophy not unknown in the west less than 100 years ago. This farce comes to a head when a girl needs to go to the bathroom	 so a soldier escorting her demands that she cover her eyes so she can't see the graffiti. The conflict is not entirely about the battle of the sexes: at one point some friction arises between a solider who is rural and the girls who are urban.<br /><br />Fortunately	 this movie was not too culturally esoteric that the comedy was lost on this neighbour and cultural cousin of the Great Satan. You have to be in the mood for it	 but no one should avoid this movie because they think that they won't get it."	1.0
"Disappointing and undeniably dull true-crime movie that has poorly cast character actor Jeremy Renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of Jeffrey Dahmer	 who was easily one of the last century's most recognizable degenerates/serial killers. Released straight-to-video back in early 2003	 ""Dahmer"" is an overtly talky	 boring	 badly acted and virtually bloodless snore-fest of a true-crime drama that never truly delves into the monstrous and demented psyche of the late mass murderer like it had the perfectly good potential to do! What it does	 however	 attempt to do for reasons unknown to me is evoke some sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him out to be what is ultimately a lonely	 nebbishy and severely socially inept homosexual loser who was simply lookin' for love in all the wrong places as opposed to the cold	 calculating and depraved sicko and madman that he was! Overall	 2003's ""Dahmer"" is one that true-crime buffs everywhere might as well skip because I'm not kidding when I say that it's one of the worst serial-killer biopics ever done! It's even sorrier than other pathetic and exploitive straight-to-video trash like ""Gacy""	 ""Bundy""	 ""Ed Gein"" and ""The Night Stalker""! (Turkey-Zero Stars)"	0.0

Walker obviously came back at a convenient time	 because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & co. have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the U.S. government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really would like it back...<br /><br />Essentially	 'Cliffhanger' is another 'Die Hard' clone. Just trade in the confines of Nakatomi Plaza to the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains	 complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal. Naturally	 that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough	 as Stallone's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease	 and slams face-first into several rock faces with no apparent side-effects. After all	 isn't that what action movies are all about?<br /><br />'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies around. A showcase of great scenes and stunts. One of the early stunts is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in a movie	 and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning	 it maintains its action awesomeness. John Lithgow's lead villain is entertaining	 and one bad dude. Quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever.<br /><br />'Cliffhanger' is easily one of Stallone's best efforts	 definitely Renny Harlin's best effort	 and a very exciting action movie - 9/10"	1.0
"This is a very strange film by director/animator Richard Williams. All who know of William's work know it's a bit off-kilter (if not ingenious) but this one takes the cake.<br /><br />It features two hapless ragdolls who have to save their owner's new French doll from a lustful pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way. The strength in this movie lies primarily in its aesthetic quality; its strange character designs	 its powerful animation	 and its stark contrast of the sweet and scary. Williams' brilliant animation portrayed Raggedy Ann and Andy as real rag dolls	 floppy and darned	 rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls	 which made it more believable (at least in a visual sense). The animation shines on the bring us the Camel-with-the-Wrinkled-Knees	 whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end	 the silent-movie chase with Sir Leonard Looney and	 of course	 the Greedy.<br /><br />The Greedy animation	 on its own	 is possibly the most exquisite psychedelic animation I've ever seen. There's something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop--and every second it's something new. Living in what was deemed ""the Taffy Pit	"" the Greedy is a massive blob man that lives in and mercilessly eats sweets. He sings a song that I can't help but feel hold some sexual undertones	 then tries to kill Raggedy Ann for her candy heart.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this film is that there are too many songs. It continuously bogs down the movie's pace because there are SIXTEEN of them. There are about six good songs (which should have been the only ones) including ""I Look	 And What Do I See?""	 ""No Girl's Toy""	 ""Blue"" (though they didn't need to make him sing it twice)	 ""I Never Get Enough""	 ""Because I Love You"" and maybe ""I'm Home."" The others just seem unnecessary and frankly aren't too amazing to listen to.<br /><br />This is a weird film with strange undertones	 but if that's what you're looking for	 you won't find better."	1.0
"In a year of pretentious muck like ""Synecdoche	 New York"" a film born out of Charlie Kaufman's own self-indulgence	 comes a film that is similarly hard to watch but about three times as important. ""Frownland"" is a labor of love by the crew	 the actors and the filmmaker	 shot over years by friends. It traces a man who cannot communicate through his thoroughly authentic	 REAL Brooklyn world. The people that you see are a step beyond even the stylization of the ""mumblecore"" movement. They are real people	 painfully trapped in their own self-contained neuroses	 unwilling to change	 unable. The real world to them is their own set of delusions and because this is a film about people who are so profoundly out of touch	 it is very difficult to watch. It is 16mm film-making without proper light	 money or any of the other factors that would make a film ""slick""	 but its honesty can not be understated	 a fact that would cause a room full of people to dismiss it and for Richard Linklater to give it an award as he did at SXSW. This does remind of films like ""Naked"" or the best of the ""mumblecore"". It is a film that is not for everyone	 but one that challenges you to watch and grows on you the longer you think about it."	1.0
I saw this film by chance on the small box. It has a fantastic and chilling scene about poisonous gas. A lot about fanatical patriotism. A bit of eroticism. I can't believe it's still waiting for 5 votes!!	1.0
"This documentary follows the lives of Big and Little Edie Beale	 a mother and daughter	 who lived as recluses in their family mansion in East Hampton	 NY from the mid-50s through the late 70s. By the time the filmmakers find them	 the mansion is falling apart	 and the women	 one 78 and the other 56	 share a squalid room. The older Edie Beale is the aunt of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and the younger is her first cousin. The women were originally going to be evicted from the house due to its decrepit condition	 but Jackie sent them money for repairs so they could keep living there.<br /><br />At times this movie can seem exploitative	 as neither woman seems in the best of mental health	 but at other times	 the movie is hard to look away from. ""Little"" Edie blames her mother for her current state	 and her mother fires back that Edie was never going to be the success she thought she was. ""Little"" Edie often seems trapped in the past	 focused on choices she made decades ago	 and loves showing off pictures from her youth	 where she clearly was a beautiful debutante. Her mother seems more resigned to her fate	 to live out the rest of her life in terrible conditions. There are definite hints of the glamorous life both women once lead	 from the pictures that show a happy family	 to the grand portrait of the older Edie next to her bed. From what we see of the house	 most of the rooms in it are empty	 the walls are cracking and falling apart	 and ""Little"" Edie leaves food in the attic for the racoons to feast on. And of course there are numerous cats running around.<br /><br />At its heart	 this documentary is incredibly sad. While neither woman seems particularly depressed by their lot in life	 the squalor they live in is utterly awful. It's not particularly clear if there is even running water in the house	 and you get the impression that they have essentially been abandoned by their family.<br /><br />However	 as a documentary	 the film is a wonder to behold	 and is highly recommended."	1.0
"I first saw this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" when it first appeared on television. I actually anticipated seeing the film when it was advertised and it more than lived up to my expectations. I have now purchased the DVD and plan to watch it every year. With the exception of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" I consider this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" one of the best Christmas movies ever made. George C. Scott is excellent and a superb cast led by Roger Rees surrounds him! Scott proves once again that he is one of finest actors of our time. Scott has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself. How can someone be remembered as both Patton and Scrooge? Scott does so easily. The direction is marvelous with the fine sets	 costumes and music that give the movie a special feeling of the time	 place and era depicted. You will simply love this movie and will place it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season."	1.0
"Prussic gas	 a murderer donning a red clansman suit and hood wielding a white whip	 and the murders of college school girls at the hands of paid convicts enlisted by a mysterious mastermind who keeps his face hidden within an office containing aquariums of turtles and fish. The inspectors at Scotland Yard	 Higgins(IJoachim Fuchsberger)and his superior Sir John(Siegfried Schürenberg)certainly have their hands full with this case. It all seems to center around student Ann Portland(Uschi Glas)	 who	 when she turns 21	 is to inherit a great deal of wealth. The girls who are targeted share a room with Ann	 but the reason for their murders remains a mystery SY's finest must figure out. The staff of the girls' dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise	 talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip. Two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation. It's a clever scheme where a driver	 Greaves(Günter Meisner)meets the convicts(..who hide in a barrel)who are assisted by a corrupt prison guard. Taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind	 he gives them orders on who to kill and how. Uncovering this operation is a top priority for Higgins and Sir John for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening. Under suspicion are girls' dormitory headmistress	 her author brother	 a sweaty	 incredibly nervous chemistry teacher	 a snooping gardener	 and the Bannister. Some are red herrings until they are disposed of	 throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered. The ending features multiple twists. <br /><br />Out of the Krimi films I've seen	 THE COLLEGE GIRL MURDERS is the closest to a giallo with it's colorful killer	 a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects	 & sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory. I think you can also see the influence of James Bond on this particular Krimi film with the villain mastermind's secret hideout with an alligator pit(..which isn't used)	 the fake bible/water pistol	 when opened	 fires the gas into the face of startled victims	 the Greaves' Royles Royce which has latches that cause flaps to darken the windows without revealing the passenger in the back seat	 and the peep holes used to spy on the girls in their rooms and while swimming. Many might consider Sir John a liability due to his bumbling	 buffoonish behavior and how he often undermines Higgins' abilities to get at the truth(..perhaps poking fun at know-it-all British inspectors who harm a case more than solve it)..I felt he was used as comedy relief	 particularly with his attempts at psychoanalyzing suspects and potential victims	 often misunderstanding what are told to him. Higgins	 using the skills adopted over his years as an investigator	 instead follows the clues/facts	 often avoiding Sir John as much as possible. Capable direction by the reliable Alfred Vohrer who keeps the pace humming at a nice speed	 and the screenplay is full of interesting characters and lurid content..the fact that so many of the adults surrounding the dormitory are suspect	 any of them might be the one wielding the whip or calling the shots behind those murdered girls' executions. I'd say this may be one of the best(..if not the best)examples of the Krimi genre	 for it keeps you guessing	 always one more ace up it's sleeve..the revelations unearthed at the very end are quite eye-opening(..and	 you even get a literal unmasking of the real mastermind pulling the strings to top it all off)."	1.0
"Really touching story of a recruitment camp in America	 where young men are prepared for the Vietnam war. The human study always appealed to me when it comes to war movies	 because it translates personal	 subjective opinions on war	 opposed war action movies where action	 and technical data are being analyzed to the prejudice of the human factor. <br /><br />The movie manages to put a new spin on an already ancient subject	 and manages to distance itself from usual war movies	 especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the view-point of traditional standard. The movie focuses on the tragic character of Bozz	 who smartly avoids being sucked in by the dehumanizing war machine	 and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fight for something he doesn't believe in	 spends his energy in searching ways to avoid being sent overseas	 both for himself and comrades and ironically ends up finding his own just reason for finally going to war. Perfect irony.<br /><br />The acting is truly exceptional	 and the documentary-style shooting almost makes you feel transposed into the movie. Also the movie will provide food for thought for those exhilarated by the action in usual war movies or war-games enthusiasts	 hopefully awakening some minds of a generation which luckily escaped the terror of being drafted."	1.0
"""Transylvania 6-5000"" is an insignificant but occasionally funny and charming mid 80's horror parody with some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of genuine opportunities to chuckle in the script. Two bozo journalist of a gossipy tabloid newspaper are sent	 very much against their will	 to Transylvania to do a story on the alleged return of mad scientist Frankenstein. There are some adorable little gimmicks and details to discover left and right in the film	 like a little guillotine for hard-boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes that are being used to put in cream and sugar at the breakfast table. The wholesome of the film	 however	 is not as successful as it could and should have been	 with jokes and parody situations that are way too overlong. The Roger Corman production ""Transylvania Twist""	 which came out four years after this	 is a lot funnier and much more recommended. The film is particularly parodying the classic Universal milestones of the early 30's	 so you better make sure you've seen those if you want to grasp all the tiny gags and references. There's a pretty original twist indicating that the Frankenstein character only behaves like a mad-raving evil scientist when he enters his laboratory. It's also revealed that he's actually more of a Father Damien sort of messiah who's only concerned with the condition of exiled monsters. Michael Richards	 the freaky guy who plays Kramer in Seinfeld	 stars as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments. I'm pretty sure John Turturro's character in ""Mr. Deeds"" was inspired by Richards's role here."	0.0
"While there aren't any talking animals	 big lavish song production numbers	 or villians with half white / half black hair ... it does have 1 thing ... realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance	 and Walt & Roy did in their eras with the studio.

"It must have been excruciating to attend the dailies as the shooting continued on this failure of a film. Probably Cruise	 the Exec. Prod.	 saw what was happening and had Towne use much	 much more of the nude footage in the final cut then Towne wanted to	 to make up for the disaster he saw looming.(Maybe Cruise even thought of ""Titanic"".)A few items: Colin Farrell can't act his way out of a paper bag. But he's one of the flavors-of-the-decade	 a producer's darling and one is forced to avoid the embarrassment of watching him by not attending his films. He has so many moments of not believing in what he's doing and you can see it in his eyes. I think he would have been at his best as a film actor	 albeit not as rich or famous as he is now	 playing second banana to dynamic leads who can act. The trap of spending a lot of money for period sets	 costumes	 cars	 et al and photographing them as if they just came from the dry cleaner or car wash/wax. No one seems to want anything to look	 well	 worn. Or dirty. Is this because the production designer was told by the line producer to make sure they didn't ruin the stuff because then the company wouldhave to pay for the ruined items?<br /><br />This was a story about the depression-thirties folks	 not a Disney Broadway musical about that era. How about doing it in black and white or better yet	 given Caleb Deschanel as your D.P.	 have him desaturate the colors during the mix to suggest some of the actual grime and poorness of the times. It should have been	 after all	 a bit depressing to live so desperately as these folks did	 in the Depression. More on Farrell. Did anyone for a moment believe this guy was a writer? H.L. Mencken on the wall; did I see his eyes roll at one point? Hayek and Farrell as a sexually dynamic duo? Sending a boy to do a man's work? Perhaps in the book	 which I haven't read	 the story was about an older woman and a youth. I cannot delve too deeply into the middle to latter parts of the film because I bailed out early on. But the memory of the scenes I did see made me think that someone was doing a not-too-amusing parody of a noir movie. Sort of what Saturday Night Live has been like for the past decade: not funny. (In my mind I kept thinking of a Guy Noir sketch	 music and all.)"	0.0
"What the F*@# was this I just watched? Steven STOP!! Please! This movie is insatiably bad and silly. In a bizarre departure from action and adventure	 Mr. Seagal is now fighting (obviously) wish-they-were-vampire 'like' creatures with super human strength.? OK? Oh	 and their eyes blink sideways in an inhuman way? Wow! Even still in this movie however	 to quell Seagals have-to-have-the-last-punch-and-no-one-can-kick-my-a$$ ego	 HE is somehow stronger than they are. However all of the average humans are getting crushed all around him. Come on	 I can understand the big mouth neighborhood bully or drug dealer	 but these are super human strength people. Oh and get this	 Seagal goes through a brief sting of identity issues	 because apparently he and his cohorts in the film think he is Wolverine! Oh My GO... And worst than all of that! Yes	 there is a worse than that. He has a voice over even changing voice in mid sentence while we are looking at his face. They obviously sound nothing like him and I believe it may be one of the other actors in the film. It was pure madness. Although I wanted to turn it off I always watch a movie to he end. This is an all time low even for your direct to video movies Steven. Awful! Awful! Awful! Two thumbs down! Redemeption qualities? Well I guess so	 I will be fair in that aspect. At least some of the special effects were OK	 and I like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses. The women all were quite attractive IMO. Still	 and I said STILL	 it does not make up for the blatant X-Men	 Underworld	 (insert your favorite zombie	 vampire movie here) rip off! The director	 writer	 producer	 ALL should be bansihed & exile from the movie business. I think I feel the way that most people feel about Blood Rayne (and just about all other Uwe Boll pictures) about this film. That's my whole $1.00 on this film. View if you dare."	0.0
"A friend lent me this DVD	 which he got from the director at a festival	 I think. I went in warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were a bit shaky and that the writing was good but not great. So maybe that colored my judgment but I have to admit that I liked this movie.<br /><br />The standouts where the actors. Youssef Kerkor was really good as Ernie	 the main character	 kind of pathetic in a likable way. Adam Jones (who also directed) and Justin Lane were excellent as the roommates who drive Ernie mad. The Bill character (Justin Lane)	 who spends a lot of the film dressed like a panda	 was by far my favorite; he seemed the least one-dimensional	 and reminded me of an old college roommate so much I called the guy after watching the DVD. Really kind of lovable	 and very funny. Some of the other acting was good	 some was so-so	 but none of it was bad. I also really liked the vigilante duo. Ridiculous and funny.<br /><br />I'm giving this one high marks	 even though it has some issues	 because you can tell when you watch it that these people cared	 and decided to make their movie their way. Well done to Adam Jones and crew."	1.0

"Viggo Mortensen stars as a new inmate of a haunted prison in which the warden (Played well by Lane Smith) has a grisly secret that could be the reason why various prison guards and inmates are being slaughtered by a supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is the lifer who knows the secret and is scared for his life. When I think prison movies	 I always think action movies starring Stallone or Van Damme or high caliber dramas such as Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile. However I didn't expect a ghost story more along the lines of Exorcist III. Prison however is an atmospheric effort and it certainly remains the best movie of Renny Harlin's career. The movie is creepy and has some good acting from a cast of (at the time) unknowns. Lane Smith comes off the best because his warden isn't the usual cliché of evil personified but rather nervous and twitchy which adds some credibility to a movie that far exceeds expectations.<br /><br />*** out of 4-(Good)"	1.0
"Someone actually gave this movie 2 stars. There's a very high chance they need immediate professional help as anyone who doesn't spend 30 seconds to see if you can award no stars is quite literally scary.<br /><br />This film is ... well ... I guess it's pretty much some kind of attempt at a horrible porn / snuff movie with no porn or no real horrible bits (apart from the acting	 plot	 story	 sets	 dialogue and sound). I wrongly assumed it was about zombies. <br /><br />Watching it is actually quite scary in fairness; you're terrified someone will come over and you'll never be able to describe what it is and they'll go away thinking you're a freak that watches home-made amateur torture videos or something along those lines. <br /><br />I'm so taken aback I'm writing this review on my mobile so I don't forget to attempt to bring the rating down further than the current 1.6 to save others from the same horrible fate that I just suffered. <br /><br />I worst film I've ever seen and I can say (with hand on heart) it will never	 never be topped."	0.0
"A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. Extremely well done and Polanski performs well as the diffident introvert trying hard to adapt to his dingy Paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers. Horrifying early on because of the seeming mean and self obsessed fellow tenants and horrifying later on as he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing. Personally I could have done without the cross dressing element but I accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that it had some logic	 bearing in mind the storyline. Nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element	 but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end. I can't help feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings of not being a 'real' Frenchman and Jewish to boot. Still	 there is plenty to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters is as reliable as ever."	1.0
"Now what's wrong with the actors that took part in that crap? Michael Dorn should stick to the Star Treck merchandise. John Diehl	 does anyone remember him in Miami Vice? Liked him there... Well	 whatever - what can one expect from a movie with one of the lifeguards from baywatch in the lead? Nothing	 and that's what we get. None of the characters is even likable	 the special effects are hilarious (but not funny). The story is a (very bad) joke. There is no logic whatsoever for what's happening. I got the feeling that the film makers were trying some kind of ""Attack of the killer tomatoes"" kind of thing. Especially in the scene where all the important people were discussing national security in some kind of a closet...<br /><br />If you happen to see it on TV	 switch channels - your TV set will be ever thankful."	0.0
"I'm not a fan of the Left Behind book series - the books are written at a 6th-grade reading level with a lack of research and understanding of science	 technology	 and politics. While the books do manage to remain faithful to scripture	 their methods of fulfilling prophecy are often ridiculous (an example is their explanation for the Russian/Arab invasion of Israel). Also	 the books have an unmistakable preachy tone that will turn off unbelievers rather than bring them to the gospel. Still	 I found myself reading these books because of my interest in the events of Revelation. For a similar reason	 I watched this film adaptation. I am sad to say that it is a rather mediocre film bordering on poor. The acting is actually rather decent for the most part with occasional bits of poor acting and over-acting. The script is rather bad	 though it is hardly unexpected when starting with the novel as a basis. The characters are poorly drawn and underdeveloped. Events feel scattered and disconnected. The dialogue sometimes sounds rushed. At least the book managed to flesh out its hokey conspiracy theory. Here	 the viewer is left with an incoherent mess that only makes much sense if one has read the book. The pacing of the film is also very poorly executed with the opening and conclusion seeming extremely rushed	 and the middle dragging to an excruciatingly slow trudge that makes it feel padded. The music is schizophrenic. At times	 it successfully underscores the mood and sounds fitting for a motion picture. At other moments	 it reminds me of sitcom and mini-series music. And still other bits remind me of a poppy MTV soundtrack that just doesn't belong in the film. I can give the film points for the scene of panic on board the plane	 but that's it. The other scenes involving the disasters after the Rapture are far from compelling. The film also suffers from the book's preachiness although its message isn't quite as in your face. In all	 I found the movie just as disappointing as the series. This is not the film to rally Christians around it. I hope that this film does NOT get any attention at the theaters next year. It would be more unnecessary bad publicity for Christianity. For an example of a compelling	 intelligent	 well-researched series based on Revelation that presents a realistic and Christian world view without offending the secular reader (who after all should be whom a Christian is trying to reach) read the Christ Clone trilogy by James BeauSeigneur. It's a great read and is a much better choice for unbelievers or believers who appreciate quality."	0.0
"The rumor is true: girls like COYOTE UGLY more than guys. And the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given. Jersey girl goes to New York to become a song writer. And after initial frustration of having no luck	 overhears some girls partying about the $300 each they made last night. She gets an audition at the bar they work at and surprise! The place is completely full of ""two year old toddlers"" bursting at the sight of babes dancing.<br /><br />The story is not bad and some characters are likeable	 especially Cammie (the ""fashion coordinator"" part was cute) and the bouncer but let's face it	 the drama was horrible and completely laughable from the beginning. Violet and her father looked far too ridiculous while they were relating throughout the movie. And check out Violet too jamming on that keyboard with the break dancer!<br /><br />For the first time I could think of	 how could the production be so terrible? For a brief moment with this movie	 Hollywood could stand on its two feet and show a new low without any major public outcry without saying	 ""You were warned!"" Instead	 it seems COYOTE UGLY has a purposeful intent on trying to kiss every major rear in the world. Advertising babes in a bar	 but showing a paper thin ""pursue your dream"" story disappointed every male teen you targeted!<br /><br />And finally	 the music. There was absolutely no break of music I found in this movie	 especially when it was needed (the hospital scene). Every scene felt like some short music video you just wish would stop until the bar opened. But the climax was an ultimate laugher: an '80s like song you would expect Cyndi Lauper to jump on the stage and jam with Violet. Heck	 I personally thought Bon Jovi was going to jump out with the long hair and jam too!<br /><br />Other than some really smart camera work with the coyote girls when dancing (especially the wet scene)	 and a couple cute cliches	 COYOTE UGLY is something to be purely embarrassed about. Whether you watched or made it	 it looked like nothing but time killing. Or wasting depending on how you look at it."	0.0

"I was forced to see this because a) I have an 11 year-old girl and b) we had shown her the Bonita Granville Nacy Drew movies from the 1930s	 which she thoroughly enjoyed. Personally	 I didn't think it was as humorous as the 1930s flicks	 but on the other hand	 it wasn't the nauseating piece of intelligence-insulting fluff I feared it would be. It was an inoffensive	 mildly entertaining movie. Although I'm pleased that they didn't try to ""upgrade"" Nancy to 21st Century ""hipness"" (Veronica Mars holds the title as the Modern Nancy Drew)	 I do think that they made her a little too bland	 that they didn't do enough to develop Nancy Drew - the movie could have been titled ""Jane Doe	 Girl Detective"".

"When DEATHTRAP was first released	 the poster--reproduced on the cover of this DVD--offered a graphic akin to a Rubik's Cube. It is an appropriate image: originally written for the stage by Ira Levin	 who authored such memorable works as ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE STEPFORD WIVES	 the play was one of Broadway's most famous twisters	 and under Sidney Lumet's direction it translates to the screen extremely well.<br /><br />DEATHTRAP is one of those films that it is very difficult to discuss	 for to do so in any detail gives away the very plot for which it is famous. But the opening premise is extremely clever: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is the famous author of mystery plays	 but these days he seems to have lost his touch. After a particularly brutal opening night	 an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends him a script for a play he has written. It is called ""Deathtrap	"" and Sidney recognizes it as a surefire hit. Just the sort of hit that would revive his career... indeed	 a hit to die for. And when Clifford visits to discuss the play	 events suddenly begin to twist in the most unexpected manner possible.<br /><br />Like Anthony Shaffer's equally twisty SLEUTH	 DEATHTRAP is really a story more at home on the stage than the screen--to reach full power it needs the immediacy that a live performance offers. Still	 under the expert guidance of director Sidney Lumet	 it makes a more-than-respectable showing on the screen. Much of this is due to the cast	 which is remarkably fine. Michael Caine gives a truly brilliant performance	 Dyan Cannon is funny and endearing as Sidney's relentlessly anxious wife	 and Christopher Reeve gives what might be the single finest performance in his regrettably short acting career. If you can't see it in a first-rate theatrical production	 this will more than do until one comes along.<br /><br />Gary F. Taylor	 aka GFT	 Amazon Reviewer"	1.0
"There is a scene near the beginning after a shootout where horses are running. If something red catches your eye it is because a white van is parked behind a bush by the trail.

It will make you want to grab your buddies and have them all put in 10 grand and make a better movie. The talking was so so slow	 the acting was mostly OK but couldn't be taken seriously due to the poor nature of the filming.

"I really liked Tom Barman's AWTWB. You just have to let it come over you and enjoy it while it lasts	 and don't expect anything. It's like sitting on a café-terrace with a beer	 in the summer sun	 and watching the people go by. It definitely won't keep you pondering afterwards	 that's true	 but that's not a prerequisite for a good film. It's just the experience during the movie that's great.<br /><br />I felt there were a few strands that could have been worked out a little more	 but being a Lynch fan I don't care that much anymore :)<br /><br />And I *loved* the style	 or flair of this movie. It's slick	 but fresh	 and the soundtrack is a beauty. Any music-lover will get his kicks out of AWTWB	 I can assure you.<br /><br />I'll give it 8 out 10.<br /><br />(music-wise 10 out of 10)"	1.0
"Boston legal has turned its tail and is headed for the barn door and th pig slop it has created! When this show first aired almost four season back it was a humorous slap at the legal system which all actors seem to take pride in portraying. It was funny	 diversified	 and to some extent factual. The characters portrayed were acceptable and to an extent real in their portrayals. The sexual comment and activity were limited and humorous. Julie Bowen is and was beautiful as in other series she participated but is now dragged to the lower depths of Media programming of sex and violence. Julie is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this ""production"". Rene Adjurdubois Is an excellent actor who has from the days of ""Benson"" to this production held his own in the field of entertainment	 always showing the humor and respectful acting of the production. Captain Kirk ""is"". Funny and humorous is Candace Bergan and is to be admired for her continuing in this production and is a good actress. James Spader	 there is no doubt in his acting ability	 however he should go back to his XXX origins such as ""Crash"" as it appears he has much talent and inclination in that direction. We ask that this series be trashed as it already is and its really starting to smell!!!"	0.0
"""The Man in the Moon"" is a beautifully realistic look at life through the eyes of an adolescent. Director Robert Mulligan magically re-creates screenwriter Jenny Wingfield's autobiography of her childhood with gorgeous cinematography and a haunting	 lyrical musical score. This film hits home as one of the most powerful and emotionally affecting films in recent times.<br /><br />This film is incredible	 all the acting first rate	 especially Sam Waterston and an astonishing performance by Reese Witherspoon in her film debut. You will feel every emotion as this life changing summer in 1957 on the Trant family farm comes to a conclusion.<br /><br />""The Man in the Moon"" was a limited release in 1991	 and you will love the fact that most of you're family and friends will probably have never heard of it. Buy this dvd and enjoy 100 minutes of pure poetic art. This film is truely the essence of filmaking at its finest."	1.0
"I figured that any horror film with Orson Welles in it would be weird. Necromancy sure was but it was a little too weird for it's own good. The film does indeed have a creepy feel as it deals with a coven of satanists/witches in a small town and a young woman's attempt to escape them. The director though seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience by using flashbacks and dream sequences. By the finale	 there are too many unanswered questions. What's worse	 as the story is so confusing	 it's pretty hard to root for any of the characters. It seems odd that Welles would agree to headline this film especially since he doesn't have that much to do. Maybe someday they will put out a tape of the outtakes and bloopers from this movie. Now that would really be fun!"	0.0
"All of David Prior's movies are terrible on all counts: bad writing	 bad acting	 bad cinematography	 no budget (the director's brother is usually cast as the male lead). But they all have incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional hilarity. The plot of almost every David Prior ""film"" (as I like to refer to them) is basically the same. Manly all-American commandos team up to blow up Communist baddies. But unlike other Cold War-era garbage such as Red Dawn	 Prior's movies are actually funny because of their over-the-top premises and acting. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene in which Becker (or was is the other dude?) is being summoned by General Mitchell for a top-secret mission in South America. The funniest line in the movie is then delivered	 something to the effect of ""this is my roommate	 I trained him well"". WHAT. You trained your roommate? And apparently this is going to be their solution to avoiding eviction.<br /><br />If you can find these gems on video used anywhere	 BUY THEM. They are all funny and even funnier after a few beers. Watch them with a group of your friends for a true MST3K-style experience. So far my friends and I have managed to get a hold of Night Wars and Aerobicide aka ""Killer Workout"". But the one I recommend the most over them all is Final Sanction	 with the freakish-looking Robert Z'dar."	0.0
"This low budget digital video film has strengths in the right places--writing and acting. In addition the digital photography is the best of the lot so far. In low light conditions the characteristic video umber tone prevails but	 surprising	 it rivals film stock for brightness	 clarity	 and	 saturation in brightly lit situations. This is grass roots film making at its best with snappy dialogue carrying a ""Midnight Cowboy"" kind of story about grifters doing whatever it takes to survive in urban San Francisco."	1.0
"Horrible film. About an old crusty painter who hangs around with a young girl. Boring. Tatum O Neil goes through the motions in her part	 and has some of the corniest lines in film history. Richard Burton looks close to death in this film	 and we're supposed to believe he looks ""Good for sixty"". The acting is bad	 as is the plot. The characters are awful	 as is the story. It's really hard to feel for anyone in this film	 except Larry Ewashen who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on Tatum	 he's kind of funny. This movie is really a waste of time. If you are a Tatum fan	 like me - which is why I rented it in the first place - please don't see this movie. She is really bad in it	 and you'll wonder if maybe PAPER MOON was a fluke. It wasn't	 because of BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS it's known she can act well	 but still	 don't rent this movie. And if you're a fan of Burton	 rent something when he was good looking	 and not a fossil."	0.0
"This one tends to get slighted by a lot of critics and Kurosawa fans	 but I thought it was wonderful. It's an episodic multi-character study of Tokyo's poorest	 who live in a city literally made from garbage. Though it looks like an A-Bomb just hit	 the film has a sort of serene beauty thanks to the glorious use of Technicolor. The title comes from the sound made by the insane young man who drives an imaginary trolley through the slum. All the characters were wonderful and all the stories engrossing	 but perhaps the most tragic concerns the man and his young son who live in an abandoned car. When not searching for food	 they spend their spare time using their imagination to build their dream house. An emotionally moving and beautiful film."	1.0
"In all my years of film-going	 only once have I walked out on a film	 and that was the dreadful ""Stay Tuned."" Fortunately	 the cinema refunded the ticket and I went to see ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" instead (a minor improvement). That film is ""Gone With the Wind"" compared to ""Dick	"" a comedy so unfunny that it nearly became the second film I ever walked out of. ""Dick"" was so unfunny it was even impossible to laugh AT it	 let alone laugh with it.<br /><br />Granted	 paying to see a movie with a title like ""Dick"" suggests that it will be filled with inane ""dick"" jokes and wind up a huge letdown	 and yet I had high hopes because of the notable cast (Daniel Hedaya	 Bruce McCullough	 Dave Foley	 Kristen Dunst	 etc.	 etc.) and a premise that at least promised something fresh. What the film delivered was	 as portended	 four woefully predictable ""dick"" jokes	 comic timing suffering from jetlag	 and a premise that wore thin after the first five minutes. In short	 it was the Watergate scene from ""Forrest Gump"" stretched--nay	 laid on a rack and mangled--over 90+ excruciating minutes.<br /><br />As soon as you understand that the two main characters--airless	 insipid squealers who gasp and roll eyeballs incessantly--will participate in every major Watergate event	 you begin to mentally check off the plot as it progresses: 18 and a half minutes erased from the Nixon tapes	 CHECK; the Deep Throat meetings with Woodward and Bernstein	 CHECK; John Dean getting a change of heart and testifying	 CHECK. The process drags out more languidly and about as engaging as the real Watergate affair with about as much laugh-getting to boot. And though it posits to be an amusing re-deconstruction of the events leading to President Nixon's resignation	 it turns into a paint-by-the-numbers	 choose-your-own-adventure	 fill-in-the-blanks comedy that says very little and entertains even less.<br /><br />Even the film's strong point--the aforementioned cast--is bewilderingly unproductive here. The most disappointing of all is Harry Shearer as G. Gordon Liddy. Trapped as he is behind the thick Liddy moustache and strait-jacketed in this numbingly morose screenplay	 Shearer mumbles a few lines	 tries desperately to leer from behind the prosthetic nose and eyebrows	 then disappears. Dave Foley	 one of the comic masterminds from Kids in the Hall (two others	 Bruce McCullough and Mark McKinney also appear in this film--ah	 the blessings of nepotism) fares badly as well. His H.R. Haldeman occasionally lends a much-need lightening of the funeral plot	 but the funniest thing about him is the buzz-cut he sports--perhaps the films funniest bit of all. And then there's Daniel Hedaya as Richard Nixon--oops	 I mean ""Dick."" (Ha ha how amusingly funny.) He manages to play a solid Nixon	 avoiding the pitfalls (such as overdone make up	 rubbery nose and false teeth a la Anthony Hopkins) while preserving the essence (the vacillations between human tenderness and coarseness). I seem to be forgetting someone . . . oh yes	 the two stars of the film	 those over-bubbly teenagers. Can't remember their names	 perhaps because I have repressed their performances. Nothing could be farther from funny; nothing could be more painful than having to endure their deliverly that ran the gamut of ""hyperactive"" and ""super-hyperactive"" with an occasional ""pouty"" tossed in.<br /><br />This film seemed to be a bad excuse to string together a 70s soundtrack and parade outrageous period clothing	 both of which seem to be the norm these days for films and TV shows set in the ""Me Decade."" But the clothes and the music wind up being an ersatz substitute for true characterization and plot	 a kind of extra-plot shorthand that the producers hope will compensate for anemic writing.<br /><br />The only possible use for this film is years down the road when any one of its talented cast appears on David Letterman or Conan O'Brien. This dreadful cinematic excretion will be dragged out to embarrass and hopefully humble the stunned guest star. The sad thing is that the real bad guys in all this--the writers and producers--will be far from the cameras gaze	 possibly cooking up another disaster such as this.<br /><br />"	0.0
"Another vast conspiracy movie that tries to blame the US government and the Armed Forces (especially the Army) for every disaster since the Great Flood. Anyone who has ever served time in the US military can see how bogus this film is. Uniforms	 equipment	 sets	 and mannerisms are all wrong. (And of course	 all Senior Officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots.) Blatant propaganda with no attempt at objectivity. Most of the theories presented have been disproven over the past few years. Uses every cliche'	 rumor	 and Urban Legend from the Gulf-all are presented as gospel. (The truth is	 no one knows for sure why some GW vets are sick and others are healthy as horses.) PS This is not new. War is NOT fun and I know WWII	 Korean	 and Viet Nam vets with some pretty serious ailments	 too. (And the government has the responsibility to take care of all of them.) Sensationalistic movies like this will not solve the problem!"	0.0
"This movie is AWESOME. I watched it the other day with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said it was alright	 but i think it RULEZZZ! I mean	 it's so cool. Ted V. Mikels is so brave and smart. He made a movie totally unlike those terrible Hollywood films	 like the Matrix and STop or my Mom will Shoot. It could have been better	 though. I like ninjas and pirates. I also like that big talon that the funny man wears. I think he's the coolest guy since that Domino Pizza claymation guy. Not only does this movie look really cool	 like those out-of-focus movies my dad made of my birthday when I turned 6. BUt it tells a complex tale with dozens of characters that seem to be totally unrelated	 but they all meet up in the end. It's genius how this web is woven to make everything meet up. I wish Ted V. Mikels would make a sequel. But it needs more aliens. And a pirate."	0.0
"By God	 it's been a long time since I saw this. Probably about 18 years ago?<br /><br />The movie tells us (kids) all about human blood and the circulatory system. Very professionally put together--Disney-style animation	 plus human actors--it was directed by Frank Capra	 for pete's sake!<br /><br />Kind of an overkill. I wonder if the very high production value is worth what amounts to a film-strip's worth of information on the human body? But boy will those kids watching it learn: even now I can clearly remember Dr. Baxter being challenged by Hemo himself to name what common material most resembles human blood	 to which the Doctor immediately answers ""sea water."""	1.0
"Much has been made of Rohmer's use of digital technology to 'fill in' the background. At times it works well	 the scene where Grace and her maid witness from afar the King's execution is particularly striking. At other times it gives the film a strangely amateurish look	 resembling a home video. However	 the major failing is that the sheer artificiality of the mise en scene creates an alienating effect in the viewer. We know that what we are watching is not real so how can we feel for the characters? To be frank	 I did not care at all what happened to the Lady or the Duke.<br /><br />The other major failing	 I regret to say	 is the performance of Lucy Russell in the leading role. She is in virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the film rests on her performance. OK she is speaking a foreign language but she is incapable of expressing real emotion. Her emoting in the scene where she recounts to her friend Mme de Meyler (an excellent performance by the debutante Helena Dubiel) seeing the head on a pole caused some embarrassed laughter in the audience. Also	 watch her hands when she is expressing emotion!<br /><br />All in all a very disappointing film	 particularly given the positive reviews on this site."	0.0
"George P. Cosmatos' ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" is pure wish-fulfillment. The United States clearly didn't win the war in Vietnam. They caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh-so innocent soldiers. The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation	 who made this war happen. The character of Rambo is perfect to notice this. He is extremely patriotic	 bemoans that US-Americans didn't appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier	 but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians. Like every film that defends the war (e.g. ""We Were Soldiers"") also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in South Asia. And for that matter also the reason for every single US-American soldier that was there. Instead	 Rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation. It would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories	 rather than suppressing them. ""Do we get to win this time?"" Yes	 you do."	0.0
"Beforehand Notification: I'm sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here	 but when I saw the preview for this movie	 I was thinking ""Finally!"" I have yet to see one movie about popular African-influenced dance (be it popular hip hop moves	 breaking	 or stepping) where the main character was a Black woman. I've seen an excessive amount of movies where a non-Black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it (Breakin	 Breakin 2	 Save the Last Dance	 Step Up)	 but the Black women in the film are almost nonexistent. That always bothered me considering so much of hip hop	 African-influenced dance	 and breaking was with Blacks and Latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it wasn't always men who performed it	 so I felt this movie has been a long time coming. However	 the race does not make the film	 so I also wanted it to carry a believable plot; the dancing be entertaining; and interesting to watch.<br /><br />Pros: I really enjoyed this film bringing Jamaican culture. I can't recall ever seeing a popular	 mainstream film where all the main characters were Jamaican; had believable accents; and weren't stereotypical with the beanies. The steppers	 family	 friends	 and even the ""thugs"" were all really intelligent	 realistic people who were trying to love	 live	 and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive. Even when the audience was made aware that the main character's sister chose an alternate lifestyle	 it still didn't make the plot stereotypical. I was satisfied with the way it was portrayed. I LOVED the stepping; the romantic flirty relationship going on between two steppers; the trials that the main character's parents were going through; and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with Crabs in a Barrel. I respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time	 and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world. They were all just as excellent as the fellas. I don't see that in too many movies nowadays	 at least not those that would be considered Black films.<br /><br />Cons: I'm not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this	 but I question whether they've been to real step shows. Whenever the steppers got ready to perform	 some hip hop song would play in place of the steppers' hand/feet beats. At a real step show	 there is zero need for music	 other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups. And then when hip hop songs were played	 sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the steppers' hands and feet. It was awkward. I was more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus ""Stomp the Yard"" (another great stepping movie) because the women got to represent as fierce as the guys (in ""Stomp the Yard	"" Meagan Good got all of a few seconds of some prissy twirl and hair flip and the (Deltas?) let out a chant and a few steps and were cut immediately). Even when there were very small scenes	 the ladies tore it up	 especially in the auto shop	 and it was without all that music to drown out their physical music. I know soundtracks have to be sold	 but the movie folks could've played the music in other parts of the film.<br /><br />I'm not a Keyshia Cole fan	 so every time I saw her	 all I kept thinking was ""Is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talks?"" She looked uncomfortable on screen to me. I thought they should've used a host like Free or Rocsi instead. Deray Davis was funny as usual though. Also	 I groaned when I found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto	 like stepping couldn't possibly happen anywhere else. Hollywood	 as usual. However	 only a couple of people were portrayed as excessively ignorant due to their neighborhood and losers	 which mainstream movies tend to do.<br /><br />I would've given this movie five stars	 but the music playing killed it for me. I definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs."	1.0
"NB: Spoilers within. This great movie is ""about"" so many things	 all of them successfully: sci-fi time travel	 unstable psychologies	 dystopian society	 the what-is-real syndrome	 gradual undermining of belief systems	 worldwide bioterrorism	 and a nascent love story.<br /><br />The ramifications of the story's twisted time line stir up loads of heated debate - witness the discussions within this site; or	 as an extreme	 check out the dissertation at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. Whew! Such temporal emphasis speaks mostly to the brilliant plot	 coming from the magnificent work of writers David and Janet Peoples	 not to mention the inspiration of Chris Marker's ""La Jetee."" Without a doubt	 this is one of the most successful	 fascinating time-travel movies ever conceived. But there are many other levels speaking here.<br /><br />The movie's real genius is to focus on the nasty side effects of time-travel in the mind of James Cole (Bruce Willis	 doing the best work of his career here). His journey progresses from gung-ho vaccine-hunting warrior to gradually unhinged victim  and back again. The other broad sweep of the story increasingly emphasizes the personal tale between James and Dr. Kathryn Railly (the wonderful Madeleine Stowe). I love the simultaneous shifting/opposing viewpoints of these two characters. For me it all comes to a head in the fleabag hotel room scene. By this point	 James  once gripped by an unshakable determination  now slumps in utter doubt about his own reality; while Dr. Railly  the cool and rational scientist  has finally become wildly convinced	 after absorbing James's proofs	 of his horrific predictions. Her desperation to get through to James and hang on to the mission shows how far she's come.<br /><br />Gilliam makes us care about these characters	 especially through the crescendo of tension threading their lives. The balance held between emotional roller-coaster and mounting sci-fi puzzle/thriller is exquisite. And the denouement at the airport is heart-poundingly intense because we see it coming so clearly through James's dreams. It is here	 just after James has decided to quit the whole mess  and is fighting his insanity more than ever  that he steps back up to the plate and does what is necessary for mankind. See Jose and the gun (Just before this	 the references to Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" and identity switching/confusion are brilliant.) This is a movie to be hashed out between thinking people; it not only holds up under repeated viewings	 it demands them. ""Twelve Monkeys"" is intelligent	 provocative	 bizarre	 funny	 and suspenseful stuff.<br /><br />The supporting cast is excellent	 especially Brad Pitt stealing all of his scenes and showing great flexibility as Jeffery Goines	 crazed and spoiled	 but ever the survivor. And there is David Morse as Dr. Peters (interesting how the movie simply leaves to the viewer his wicked motivation) and Christopher Plummer as Dr. Goines. But the biggest accolades belong to Terry Gilliam	 surpassing here - just barely - his outstanding ""Brazil."" (Lots of parallels	 of course	 especially the lonely combatant trying to escape his crumbling surroundings: lunacy within	 lunacy without.) Every frame of this movie has his unique stamp and tone. The soundtrack is terrific	 too.<br /><br />This is one of the great achievements of the 90s	 a true favorite of mine	 and sure to hold up for a long time to come."	1.0
"""Life hits us in the face........we must try to stay beautiful""<br /><br />Debut movie from one of Belgian's best artists (he sings songs)	 Tom Barman. A long awaited movie and---happy happy joy joy for Flemish filmmaking---really worth watching	 and a promising piece of work! It takes us into the lifes of 8 main characters that live through a Friday- and night. The title says a lot about the way we spend time with them: we float as they do into Friday night's party where they kinda' meet.<br /><br />It's rhytmic style is very 'thought off'. Superb use of music. It sometimes takes the upperhand to the images and then you feel its power. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! The party scene (20minutes???) is a thrilling visual experience cause of the way that it's shot. It keeps you really with it while it's set in a small place with a lot of people having a big party.....so hard to shoot.<br /><br />Thank you menijèr Barman for making this daring movie in these	 already some years going	 poor times of Flemish filmmaking. You made my day!"	1.0
"The box for ""To Die For"" suckered me in -- a shirtless hunky guy and the promise of some laughs and sex. There was plenty of Thomas Arklie (Simon)	 who's easy on the eyes	 but no laughs and little sexiness.<br /><br />The couple	 Mark and Simon	 have allegedly been together several years	 but neither character is interesting enough to care about	 so it's hard to imagine that they care about each other. The fault seems to lie in the script	 not the performances; both actors do the best they can with what they're given. <br /><br />The ending is sappy and unaffecting (well	 not totally unaffecting; I felt relief that it was over). <br /><br />If you're looking for a movie about gay relationships and AIDS that's funny	 ""Parting Glances"" is far better."	0.0

"In a way this is the disaster Fellini has been working towards all his life. The line between absurd masterpiece and free association bullshit is very small	 and what category a film will ultimately fit in will often just depend on personal feelings. That said	 ""Casanova"" left me in cold admiration for its sets and little more that cannot be summed up more adequately by Bukowski: <br /><br />""Casanova died too	 just an old guy with a big cock and a long tongue and no guts at all. to say that he lived well is true; to say I could spit on his grave without feeling is also true. the ladies usually go for the biggest fool they can find; that is why the human race stands where it does today: we have bred the clever and lasting Casanovas	 all hollow inside	 like the Easter bunnies we foster upon our poor children."" <br /><br />As far as I could make it out	 this is the position Fellini takes regarding his subject; granted	 with more empathy	 but disgusted nonetheless.<br /><br />Casanova's environment is made from decay and incestuous behavior	 themes Fellini dealt with more pointedly in ""Satyricon"". The succession of plot is characteristic of soft porn	 just without the coherence; and Donald Sutherland is ugly and slimy to the point of distraction.<br /><br />Yet	 there might just be a point in portraying Casanova as an unsightly fool. And I challenge anybody to formulate this point without being obvious; Fellini couldn't. More than ever he seems here like a dirty old man - a maestro	 for sure	 but one whose impulses satisfy himself more than anybody else. I find it hard imagine an audience who enjoys this film. It was a story not worth telling."	0.0
"Italy produced a lot of really great and original horror films in the 1960's - and this is certainly one of them! The first thing you will notice about Danse Macabre is the style of the film. Shot in beautiful black and white	 and due to director Antonio Margheriti's use of lighting; the film almost looks like it could be a German expressionistic horror film. This	 coupled with the horror-filled plot line ensures that Danse Macabre is a film that truly captures the essence of horror. Of course	 the fact that the beautiful Barbara Steele appears in the film doesn't harm matters - and the good news continues as	 in this film	 she gets to flex her acting muscles more than she did in the films that made her famous. The plot is very aware of the time in which this was released	 and so incorporates the great Edgar Allen Poe. We follow Alan Foster	 a writer who accepts a bet from Poe himself and Lord Blackwood that he can't spend an entire night in the latter's creepy old castle. Everyone that has spent the night there previously has died...and our hero is about to meet the previous wager-takers! <br /><br />Nowadays	 horror films don't tend to focus so much on each shot and the result is that there isn't much beauty left in the genre. It is refreshing	 therefore	 to see this film. Many of the shots here are incredibly beautiful - from the female side of the couple wearing just a see-through skirt	 to my personal favourite - a shot of smoke creeping in from under a door. This my first Antonio Margheriti film	 and even after seeing just this one; it's obvious that he was one of Italy's premier directors. Also interesting is the fact that screenplay was co-written by another of the Italian greats; Django creator Sergio Corbucci. The plot can meander a little too much at times	 but there's always enough atmosphere on hand to make sure that the film never becomes boring - and the fact that it is always intriguing	 even when the plot slows down	 ensures the same thing. The way that Danse Macabre utilises the 'haunted house' theme is both well done and original	 and helps to keep the story as eerie as possible. On the whole	 fans of Italian and/or cult cinema will not want to miss this little gem!"	1.0
"Even if one didn't realize that Sellers was in poor health at the time of filming and passed away before the film's release	 THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU would be painful viewing. It is supposedly a lampoon of Sax Rohmer's famous Oriental villain but it lacks any focus. The potential for satirical commentary on the anti-Oriental overtones of Rohmer's concept are ignored. Indeed	 the movie employs racist insults. There are hardly any actual jokes or gags	 just mostly actors behaving idiotically and spouting dreary lines. It is especially distressing to see Sid Caesar forced to spout curses and racial slurs for attempted laughs. Most of the other actors embarrass themselves as well.<br /><br />And then there's Peter Sellers. He plays the dual roles of the sinister Fu Manchu	 who is trying to concoct a formula to regain his youth and his stalwart British foe Nayland Smith. Sellers isn't one hundred per cent bad; he conveys a quirky warmth as Smith when he discusses his fetishistic attachment to his lawn mower and he's oddly moving as Manchu when he expresses his love for English music hall entertainment. But most of the time	 he plays both roles with a weary grimness	 thus further sabotaging any comical possibilities. Sellers' routines where he revitalizes his fading strength with electric shocks are particularly excruciating; he seems too convincingly agonized to be funny. <br /><br />A few genuinely witty lines	 an apt slapstick bit by Burt Kwouk (Cato in the PINK PANTHER films) as one of Manchu's minions	 and Helen Mirren's amusing musical numbers cannot salvage this mess. If anyone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is considered a comedic genius	 they won't learn anything from THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU."	0.0

The story	 about a pair of social outcasts who meet	 become friends	 and provide each other with a support system both seemed to lack as children	 is at times hilarious	 at times sad	 but always provocative. Music	 mostly by underground bands	 was used to great effect	 as was the experimentation with camera angles	 filters	 and slow or fast motion techniques. The performances (the leads are played by the writers and directors of the film) are some of the best I've seen in the last couple of years. If you ever felt like a square peg being forced into a round slot	 I really believe you'll appreciate ""By Hook or By Crook""."	1.0
